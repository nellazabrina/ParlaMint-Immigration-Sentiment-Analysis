The number of people coming into our country illegally on small boats is unacceptable.,2
"We have also: reached two new deals with France, putting more police officers on French beaches and introducing new groundbreaking technology to better detect migrants; set up a joint intelligence cell with France to target migrant interceptions on French beaches; introduced new and tougher criminal offences for those attempting to enter the UK illegally; laid statutory instruments to stop asylum claims being made at sea; and agreed returns deals with India and Albania—and had discussions just last week with Pakistan—to take back more foreign national offenders and failed asylum seekers, with more returns deals imminent All these measures form part of the new plan for immigration, which I launched in this House in February this year.",3
"The Bill introduces a range of measures, including but not limited to: a one-stop appeals process; the ability for asylum claims to be heard offshore in a third country; the ability to declare those who arrive in the UK having passed through safe countries where they could have claimed asylum inadmissible to our asylum system, meaning no recourse to public funds and limited family reunion rights; visa penalties for countries refusing to take back their nationals; quicker returns of foreign national offenders; and a new age verification to prevent adult asylum seekers from posing as children If any hon.",3
"Members have concrete proposals that are not already featured in the new plan for immigration, I would be happy to meet to discuss them.",3
"My door is always open, particularly to those from the Opposition Benches because of course they attack the new plan for immigration.",3
"They have not supported it and they voted against it, not because they are genuinely frustrated at the number of illegal migrants entering our country, as those on this side of the House and the British public are, but because they will always stand up for unlimited migration and free movement.",3
Member for Torfaen (Nick Thomas-Symonds) opposing the development of operational solutions to turn back the boats.,3
He even refuses to say if his ambition is to reduce the number of illegal migrants coming here.,3
"We will find legislative and operational solutions, and we will treat this with the same grit and determination with which we have treated all the other challenges our country has faced, including leaving the European Union and delivering a points-based immigration system.",3
"The only solution to this problem is wholesale reform of our asylum system, which the new plan delivers.",3
"Gentleman has stated yet again that his party will not support the new plan for immigration or the Nationality and Borders Bill, which is the long-term solution to breaking the model, to reforming the asylum system, to deterring illegal migration and to addressing the underlying pull factors of the UK’s asylum system.",3
"It will introduce a one-stop appeals process, which clearly he and his party are against; it will ensure that asylum claims can be heard offshore in a third country and it will ensure that those individuals who come to our country not as genuine asylum seekers, but as economic migrants, can claim asylum in first safe countries.",3
The only solution is wholesale reform of our asylum system.,2
"He has suggested the problem is down to reduced aid—failing to note that France is not a recipient of UK aid All the while the Nationality and Borders Bill is in Committee in the Commons, yet the Labour party continues to defend the rights of foreign national offenders, including murderers, rapists and those involved in the drugs trade—criminals, Mr Speaker.",3
"Labour has objected to provisions designed to prevent late submissions of evidence used to block removals of the very people we are trying to remove from our country, as well as to the one-stop-shop appeals process; it has opposed measures to tighten up immigration bail and to stop illegal migrants absconding.",3
"It means that people smugglers could face a life behind bars, and the hon.",3
We will strengthen Border Force’s powers to stop and redirect vessels and to search shipping containers to ensure that migrants are not being smuggled.,3
"Importantly, this will break the deadly business models of these smugglers.",2
"In addition, we want to make sure that the UK is less attractive to illegal migrants.",3
"He claims that all the people coming to the UK are genuine asylum seekers, but they are not, and the evidence shows that.",3
"Even the authorities in France say that 70% of people crossing the channel and entering France, and northern France in particular, are single men and they are economic migrants.",3
"Now then, seeing thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants coming across the channel is not the points-based immigration system that I thought we were going to adopt when we got to this place, so will my right hon.",3
"Friend please confirm that the best way to control illegal immigration is through offshore processing, and getting the Labour party over there to grow a backbone and back the borders Bill?",3
"As the House knows, there has been an unacceptable rise in the number of small boat crossings.",3
It will provide safe and secure accommodation for migrants while the Government carry out the necessary checks.,3
"We take the welfare of migrants seriously and will ensure that they receive basic welfare provisions, including hot food, fresh clothing, and, where necessary, medical care In the new year, we intend to expand activity at the Manston site to conduct more detailed security and initial asylum screening in parallel before people are dispersed.",3
"Arrivals will be expected to remain on-site for a maximum of five days while the security and initial asylum processing checks are undertaken, until they leave to go into further, appropriate accommodation.",3
"Our aim is to make our processes more efficient and to reduce pressure on the overall asylum system However, this is only one part of a wider process.",3
The Government remain committed to bringing an end to dangerous and unnecessary small boat crossings.,3
We are overhauling our asylum system to ensure that people-smugglers cannot profit from human misery.,3
Our new plan for immigration will reform the system and build one that is fair on those who play by the rules and firm on those who do not.,3
It will reduce pull factors by making it more difficult for migrants to remain here where they have no lawful right to do so.,3
"A cross-party report on the all-party parliamentary group on immigration detention called on the Government to end this military-style accommodation for asylum seekers, which it described as “fundamentally unsuitable” for survivors of war, torture or serious violence.",3
Will he tell us what consultations have taken place with the non-governmental organisations that work with torture survivors and victims of trafficking and other trauma?,3
"Finally, the Minister mentioned illegal migrants.",3
There is no such thing as an illegal migrant.,3
"Seeking asylum is not illegal, so when will the Government put an end to this language and to pandering to the lowest common denominator?",3
"They conducted vital security checks, processed visa and passport applications and welcomed and supported evacuees We are determined to ensure that those evacuated here have the best possible start to life in the UK.",3
"That includes providing clarity about their immigration status, which is the subject of a policy statement that the Government are publishing today.",3
"Secondly, we will work with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to identify and resettle refugees who have fled Afghanistan.",3
"This replicates the approach that the UK has taken in response to the conflict in Syria and complements the UK resettlement scheme, which resettles refugees from across the world.",3
They will be able to apply for British citizenship after five years under existing rules We could not have welcomed so many people to the United Kingdom under Operation Pitting without the support of local authorities.,3
"We will provide a complete package covering health, education and integration support costs for those on the ACRS and ARAP.",3
"Local authorities will receive a core tariff of more than £20,000 per person, which will be provided over three years to support resettled Afghans to integrate into British society and become self-sufficient more quickly.",3
"We are creating a portal where people, organisations and businesses can register offers of support, and we are extending the community sponsorship scheme so that friends and neighbours, charities and faith groups can come together to support a family through the resettlement scheme Afghan nationals will also be able to make applications to come to the UK via one of our existing immigration routes.",3
"Family members of British citizens or those with indefinite leave to remain, or family members of refugees who do not qualify for the ACRS, can apply to come to the UK via the family routes or the family reunion rules respectively A number of Afghan nationals are already in the UK on an economic, work or study route, and we recognise that they may face difficulties in making a further application if they cannot obtain the correct documentation that they need to extend their stay.",4
"We will also remove the “no switching” rule on some routes for Afghan nationals, which means that there is no requirement to travel outside the UK to make an application at one of our global visa application centres.",3
There is no change in the UK’s position that people can only claim asylum from within the UK.,3
"There are a number of claims already in the asylum system, and they will be considered in line with new country guidance, which will be published shortly.",3
and learned Friend please explain how mobile phone data is being used to track and capture people smugglers who are sending illegal immigrants over the channel?,3
"I warmly welcome the Paymaster General to his place, and, obviously, I warmly welcome the statement One of the many reasons the people of Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke—over 70%—voted to leave the European Union was their wish to see us take back control of our borders.",3
"Let us get out of the European convention on human rights, and then let us scrap the Human Rights Act in this country, so that foreign criminals who are taking advantage of the current system, and economic migrants who are crossing the English channel and entering this country illegally, can be deported very much more quickly than they are now.",3
"I really hope that nothing is off the table, but at the centre of it should be a commitment to and delivery of safe routes, including resettlements, with a good big target for that; expansion of the family reunion rules; humanitarian visas to enable people needing protection to travel safely; recognising, as does the refugee convention, that many asylum seekers have no option other than an irregular journey; and efficient decision-making, not blaming the asylum seekers for clogging up the system It distresses me how easily language is adopted.",3
People are not “illegal” and neither is seeking asylum.,2
"The narrative is also that they should have gone through one of the UNHCR or IOM schemes, which are good but inevitably too small We are told by the Home Secretary that 70% of those in the boats are young men who are economic migrants.",3
"To quote directly from Home Office figures published today: “In the year ending June 2021, Germany received the highest number of asylum applicants (113,625) in the EU+”— which is the EU plus the EEA and Switzerland— “followed by France … When compared with the EU+”— as the Home Office calls it— “for the year ending June 2021, the UK received the 4th largest number of applicants … This equates to 8% of the total asylum applicants across the EU+ and UK combined over that period, or the 17th largest intake when measured per head of population.” We are 17th because so many stay in the countries they travel through or reach on the way, which are closer to their country of origin.",4
"There are also issues of climate change and unresolved conflicts, and upstream investment is essential I am not sure what the legal basis is for turning back small boats.",3
"We are told there is one, and my big question today is to ask the Minister to explain—if I say this is not an exam question, she will understand the reference to yesterday’s debate—the legal basis for turning back small boats Those who are so desperate as to pay smugglers are not accessories to the crime, although by being called criminals that is what they are badged as.",3
How about advocating at home the benefits that refugees bring?,3
"Internationally, with France and globally—because we are global Britain, after all—we should be seeking co-operative, constructive partnerships in responding to refugees.",3
"The new plan for immigration has drawn such criticism from the UNHCR, to which the Government look to identify the refugees we will take I hope that the table will hold everything—everything according to the Prime Minister—and that it will turn into a new drawing board.",3
"My Lords, this debate takes place under the sombre cloud of the tragic death of 27 migrants off the French coast yesterday.",3
"The approach of the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is to provide a safe and legal way to apply for asylum from abroad—for example, by applying to an embassy or some specific tribunal abroad But this simply would not work.",3
"Anyone who was refused or knew they would be refused asylum if they made such a claim would still have exactly the same incentive as now to enter the UK illegally by boat or on the back of a lorry, so it will not stop the boats attempting this perilous journey.",3
"If anything, it will add to the problem, since many more people will apply for asylum if such a simple route is established, with plausible claims that cannot be disproved, especially if we accord such claimants the same rights to legal aid, appeal and judicial review, and in the refugee convention, immigration Acts, human rights Acts, modern slavery Acts and so on.",3
"Remember, it is the better off who migrate from developing countries; the very poor cannot afford to and cannot pay the smugglers.",2
"All those things have made mass migration possible in a way that was not envisaged when those conventions were negotiated If anyone doubts the potential scale of those who would seek asylum if they could, without running any risk to themselves, look at the response to the United States diversity visa lottery.",3
"Every year, the US offers 50,000 visas to a different selection of countries that have no tradition of migration to the United States.",3
"In the last year for which I have the figures, 13% of the Albanian population, 7% of the Uzbek population, 8% of the population of Ghana, 14% of the population of Sierra Leone and 15% of the population of Liberia applied for those visas—in all, 20 million people from this small selection of countries to which they were made available.",3
"Similar numbers would undoubtedly want to live in Europe and the United Kingdom, if we gave people the chance to enter, at no costs to themselves, the lottery of our asylum seekers—and it is essentially a lottery I sincerely hope that the Nationality and Borders Bill will provide a way of removing the chief magnet that draws migrants across the channel at great risk, which is the virtual certainty that, once here, they will never be deported.",3
"The noble Lord, Lord Green, contrasted the people coming across the channel with what he called genuine refugees.",3
Can the Minister confirm the government figures that I have seen that say that the majority of people coming across the channel are granted refugee status?,3
"The noble Lord, Lord Lilley, quoted the number of applications for US visas from a significant number of countries.",3
A lot of our discussion in this debate focuses on what we can do to stop the boats.,3
"However, I go back to a bleak January day in 2016 when I went to the memorial service for a 15 year-old Afghan boy called Masud who died in the back of a lorry while trying to get across the channel to join his sister here in the UK In the year to that death, about a dozen refugees died trying to cross the channel in the back of boats, on trains and through other vehicles.",3
"Those routes, through a combination of Covid and government action, have essentially been closed off, so people have taken to the boats.",3
"If the Government could somehow just snap their fingers and stop the boats, desperate people who have ties to the UK, such as the Afghan soldier documented in the Times this morning, would still seek to come here.",3
"The odds are that those routes will become more and more dangerous, and, as several noble Lords have said—I associate myself with essentially everything said by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee—at great profit to nasty, illegal criminals There has been a lot of discussion about so-called pull-factors.",3
It is worth looking at what we actually do to the refugees who arrive here seeking to exercise the right to which they are entitled.,3
"I have no doubt that many more should be upheld Unlike many other countries, we do not allow people seeking asylum to work while their claims are being processed.",3
"What happened last night was a horrible example of the dangers of crossing in small boats, but, as other noble Lords have said, it was not the first such incident and it probably will not be the last There was a time when people smuggled themselves on passenger trains and freight trains and virtually killed the traffic across the channel at that time.",3
"Now, boats are used.",3
I can understand why the French authorities and local police are not very enthusiastic about looking after refugees and probably want shot of them.,3
"Having worked with French authorities all those years ago, I am convinced that if the Government and the French Government tried, there could be a very good joint policy and implementation to sort this out in a humanitarian way that does not involve people going across in small boats or smuggling themselves in lorries, but gives those who are justified in seeking asylum what they want.",4
"There are now joint statements from the Prime Minister and the President of France that they will work together, which is nice to see but they must deliver, at Calais and the other places along the coast, as well as in this country, and come up with a policy that is fair to everyone The noble Lord, Lord Lilley, commented that the only people who can afford to pay the smugglers are the middle classes.",3
"If some of them are having such a rough time in Syria, for example, that they seek asylum here, so be it, but we should not be poaching them.",3
"Around 56 years ago, I came here, not in a boat, and not as a refugee.",3
There has been nothing but constant complaints about immigration since—Powell and all that sort of stuff—but at the same time I have seen domestic political and social life transformed by the presence of immigrants.,3
"We have a serious prospect—not that I wish it because I love the Prime Minister, as does everybody else—of the next prime ministerial contest being between three or four immigrants, and nobody will bat an eyelid, yet we had a Conservative Member of Parliament complaining about grinning pickaninnies not all that long ago.",3
"We are still president of COP 26 and, as some noble Lords have said, we made commitments and accepted a solution to the coal question that will sink islands into the sea and create more refugees over the next 10 years.",3
"Let us take a positive attitude; let us share responsibility with NATO countries—or whichever countries they are—for the immigrants For example, the noble Lord, Lord Lilley, cited Albanians and others.",3
We have to change our minds as to what the positive role of immigration is.,2
The costs are borne by the immigrant and the benefits accrue to the country receiving them.,2
She talked about the serious problem with our immigration control.,3
"There were 84,132 asylum applications in 2002; in 2019, there were 35,737, as the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, said.",3
"In the year ending 21 June, asylum applications were 4% down on the previous year.",3
"In 2019, there were 680,000 long-term international immigrants into the United Kingdom, of which asylum seekers accounted for just 6%—just 6% of immigration to the UK was asylum seekers.",3
"I accept what the noble Baroness, Lady Fox of Buckley, says about public concern about immigration, but it is the 680,000 we should be looking at, not the 6% who are asylum seekers The noble Baroness, Lady Hoey, said that people want to come here because English is easier to learn.",3
"I found any foreign language other than English the most difficult language to learn, and other people probably think the same.",2
"Of course, if they did run away, they would have no chance at all of being granted asylum in the UK.",4
"Would it not be a good idea if we allowed them to work, and then they would become taxpayers The noble Baroness talked about the shortcomings of the Home Office, especially in the immigration section.",3
"In 2020, the UK had six asylum applications per 10,000 of population.",3
"I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Fox of Buckley, that one of the benefits was supposed to be taking back control of our borders, yet EU citizens can still use the automatic gates—not only that, but the Government threw open the automatic gates at airports to another 10 countries.",3
"I know that you can take back control of your borders and then decide to throw them open, but I do not think that was quite the idea.",3
"One of the consequences is that we do not have Dublin III or the Schengen Information System, which showed us whether someone had made an application for asylum in another country, so there are downsides to Brexit.",3
"People must accept that this is the case The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said that the majority of those seeking sanctuary are granted asylum by the Home Office because they are genuine asylum seekers.",3
"My noble friend Lady Hamwee said that most people crossing the channel have no choice, because they cannot claim asylum in the UK unless they are in the UK.",4
"The noble Lord, Lord Lilley, said that only the middle class and well-off can afford to migrate—that seems to contradict the argument that these people are economic migrants.",3
"He said that, once here, they will never be deported; I absolutely agree.",3
"The National Audit Office estimates that the number of illegal immigrants in the UK is between 600,000 and 1.2 million.",3
"As well as the large numbers involved, the fact that the range is between 600,000 and double that shows the lack of government control over immigration The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Coventry said that we need to put the people smugglers out of business.",3
"The noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, talked about people smugglers.",3
"It is because there is no other way to claim asylum in the UK other than to come here illegally—there are no safe and legal routes at the moment, as the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, said.",3
The other alternative he mentioned—sealing the borders—is not possible.,3
"Looking at the length of the French and UK coastlines, you cannot seal the borders; we need a humanitarian alternative As the noble Lord, Lord Desai, said, let us celebrate the success of immigration.",3
"If our island is becoming overcrowded, let us turn the tap down on the 94% of immigration that is not asylum seekers The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, talked about sharing the resettlement between areas of the UK.",3
We need to share the resettlement of asylum seekers across the globe.,2
"As has been said, it comes at a time when we have just seen a human tragedy in the English Channel—a reminder of the dangers of the channel and the fact that people’s lives are at risk every day in these makeshift, flimsy, small boats The number arriving in small boats remained relatively small until about two years ago.",3
"While clamping down on those coming in the back of lorries has been a factor, Brexit meant our exiting the Dublin III regulation, so the UK no longer has an agreement with any EU member state to return individuals who had set foot in those countries first prior to claiming asylum in the UK.",3
There just are not enough staff to process the asylum applications and this contributes to longer and longer wait times.,2
A better-resourced system could vet better and more quickly and progress cases through the system either to granting asylum or to enforced removal.,3
"It serves neither those making claims nor, indeed, the general public No doubt, those involved in human trafficking are aware that first, the UK has no extradition treaty to replace Dublin III and, secondly, that once here, individuals will be in the creaking system for some time, perhaps for more than a year or, indeed, several years I want also to repeat some of the figures that have already been quoted because, while asylum cases have increased recently, as have been said, asylum cases peaked at just over 84,000 in 2002, falling to just under 18,000 in 2010 before rising again to just above 35,500 in 2019.",3
"However, as has been pointed out, that figure is well below the 2002 one As has already been said, asylum seekers made up about 6% of all immigrants to the UK in 2019.",3
"While I think the figure mentioned was of 98% of those arriving by boat in the English Channel being recorded as claiming asylum, they are, in fact, largely people coming from war-torn countries rather than economic migrants, as we are sometimes led to believe According to other statistics from the Library, to which reference has already been made, the percentage refused at the first stage was at a high of 88% in 2004, falling to 59% in 2014, and again to 48% in 2019.",3
So 52% of all asylum applications are approved or accepted at the first stage.,3
"In 2020, there were six asylum applications for every 10,000 individuals in the UK; the EU 27 average is almost twice that, at 11 applications per 10,000 This is a serious problem.",2
"First, it does not best support asylum seekers, because those in genuine need of protection and support are left in a state of uncertainty longer than necessary.",3
"Secondly, those who are not bona fide asylum seekers are not best served by delaying their return, creating false hope.",3
"Thirdly, it badly lets down the public and their legitimate expectations of the system and arrangements The Home Secretary has been in post for more than two years, and has repeatedly committed to stopping channel crossings in small boats by making the route unviable.",3
"The reality is, of course, that we have seen unprecedented numbers making the journey in small boats, with a very high figure indeed for this year alone.",3
"I should be interested to know from the Government’s response today whether they believe they are getting value for money in what they are paying to the French or not, as there seems to be a degree of confusion in the comments made The reality is that we need meaningful action to support genuinely vulnerable people, to improve the somewhat chaotic and perhaps less than humane asylum system and, of course, to bring criminal gangs to justice.",3
"I wonder whether sufficient attention, despite what the Government maintain happens, is actually given to dealing with those gangs, who are the cause of the trouble, as opposed to various schemes to stop their victims—because that is what they are—who are left crossing the English Channel in small boats.",3
"It is far better, I should have thought, to deal with the problem at source, which is the criminal gangs who encourage those trips to be made and make considerable sums of money out of it We need improved support for victims of modern slavery and human trafficking and tougher sentences for perpetrators.",3
"The basis of our skills-based immigration system is that, if people have the skills to come here, we will welcome them.",2
We are a nation of immigrants.,2
"I presume that the noble Baroness, Lady Bennett, counts herself an immigrant.",3
"A good proportion of the people speaking in this debate are immigrants, as are half the Cabinet Secondly, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Hoey, for securing this important debate on the issue of migrants arriving in the UK on small boats, which is a different point from that which the noble Lord, Lord Desai, makes.",3
We will go on shortly to further discuss the dreadful boat tragedy that we learned of yesterday.,3
"As the noble Baroness, Lady Hoey, my noble friend Lord Lilley and, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, said, France is a safe country with a fully functioning asylum system, as are the other countries of Europe through which these people typically pass on their way to the UK.",4
"There is no need for those in need of refuge to make these hazardous journeys across the channel, because a safe route to asylum exists in Europe.",3
"Noble Lords will note that we have had a Syrian resettlement scheme over the last few years The point made by my noble friend Lord Lilley that the middle classes are the only ones who can afford to come is important, in terms of vulnerability and neediness, because the people who can afford to pay people smugglers are the ones most likely to get here.",3
"That the majority are male and between the ages of 18 and 34, although they might be skinny when they get here, is surely an indicator of vulnerability In recent decades, the institution of refuge has been abused by those who want to come to the UK for other reasons and who view asylum as a means to gain entry which would otherwise be denied to them.",3
"The phenomenon of using small boats to cross the channel, which we have seen grow since 2018, is merely the latest and most outward manifestation of a problem that the Home Office has had to deal with for many years: large numbers of people, mostly without documents—as the noble Baroness, Lady Hoey, said—travelling from the safe countries of Europe and seeking asylum in the UK To suggest that all these people have no haven in European countries and that they are driven into these perilous crossings by desperation is just not true.",3
"As the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, said, these crossings are made for the same reason as applies to those hiding in lorries and containers or using fraudulent travel documents on passenger services: to evade our immigration system The noble Lords, Lord Kerr and Lord Dubs, asserted that we had closed the door and that this was why this situation has happened.",3
"In terms of Dubs, we met our commitment of 480 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children—the noble Baroness, Lady Bennett, might shake her head, but these are facts.",3
"We have issued 39,000 family reunion visas since 2015.",3
To say that we have closed the door is just not true We are clear that access to our asylum system should be based on need and not the ability to pay people smugglers.,3
It is the most comprehensive reform in decades to fix the broken asylum and illegal migration system.,3
"This country has a long tradition of welcoming those in need of sanctuary, but not everyone who wants to settle here can do so and those who do so must come here legally As the noble Baroness, Lady Hoey, said, based on her experience of visiting Dover, the brave and highly trained officers of Border Force, day in and day out, set out to sea in cutters and coastal patrol vessels to manage the small boats used by migrants to cross the channel.",3
That is why HM Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution are involved in responding to these crossings: a life in danger at sea is a life that we will try to save if at all possible.,3
Border Force has also developed safe and legal maritime tactics to turn around migrant vessels and prevent crossings.,3
That is why we are pushing for the unconditional return of all those arriving by small boats to their country of embarkation as soon as possible.,3
That is the reason for the inadmissibility rules that have now come into force: they make it easier for us to return those who have arrived by small boats.,3
"We are now focused on agreement with France and other members of the EU to accept back those who have arrived in the UK by small boats, without condition.",3
The UK pledged to make a further financial investment of £54 million to tackle illegal migration and small boats.,3
We can confirm that the processes for French funding arrangements agreed in July to tackle illegal migration are in place.,3
"She will understand that I cannot go into any further detail than that In the meantime, those who arrive, claim asylum in the UK and are destitute have to be accommodated and supported while their cases are considered.",3
"We have a particular responsibility for the care and welfare of vulnerable unaccompanied children, and from this week local authorities have been notified that the national transfer scheme has been temporarily mandated to ensure that unaccompanied asylum- seeking children receive the critical care, support and accommodation that they need upon their arrival I will go into further detail on that for the benefit of the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and others.",3
"In 2020—this goes to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr; he and I are always disagreeing on this—the UK received the second highest number of asylum applications from unaccompanied children, 2,773, out of all the EU-plus countries.",3
"As I said earlier, more than 39,000 family reunion visas have been granted since 2015 I have talked about the support that the UK has funded.",3
"It strengthens security infrastructure, making it more difficult for crossings to be attempted, and supports migrants into the French asylum system, giving them a safe and legal alternative to the dangerous and unnecessary crossings A noble Lord asked me about French interceptions.",3
"They are active in their efforts to prevent these crossings, but they are increasingly being met by violence from people smugglers and migrants, emphasising that not all those who are making these crossings are vulnerable victims.",3
"As French preventive efforts bite, we have seen the people smugglers operate from ever-greater stretches of coastline, using bigger boats, carrying more migrants and taking greater risks.",3
"That is why we are redoubling our efforts to provide support An asylum system should provide a safe haven to those fleeing persecution, oppression or tyranny.",3
"I have talked about our proud record, but, as the title of this debate suggests, we now need to stop the dangerous, illegal and unnecessary small boat crossings of the channel, control our borders and return those with no right to be in our country In terms of financial support for councils which take migrants, local councils and health partners who resettle families will receive up to £4,500 per child for education, £850 to cover English language provision for adults requiring this support, and £2,600 to cover healthcare Sorry, this is slightly out of sync, but 273 asylum-related returns were concluded in the year ending June 2021, which, considering Covid, shows that we are making returns.",3
Security is the number one reason for border control.,2
"People arriving by small boats are subject to stringent checks immediately upon arrival in the UK, and again as they are processed into the asylum system The Government’s commitment to reforming our immigration and asylum system is being delivered, as I said, through our new plan for immigration and its centrepiece, the Nationality and Borders Bill.",3
The plan has three objectives: increasing the fairness and efficiency of our system so that we can better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum; deterring illegal entry into the UK; and removing more easily from the UK those with no right to be here.,3
"Our long-term plan will prioritise bringing over the most vulnerable, deterring illegal migration and creating an effective sanction where there are no relevant mitigating circumstances.",3
I have offered to work with France to put more boots on the ground and do whatever is necessary to secure the area so that vulnerable people do not risk their lives by getting into unseaworthy boats There is a global illegal migration crisis.,3
We are also seeing it play out on several land borders in Europe and in the Mediterranean Sea.,3
"The United Kingdom has a generous, humane approach to asylum seekers and refugees.",4
"Yes, people should come here legally and the system must be fair, but the main issue is this: crossing the channel in a small boat is extremely dangerous.",2
"They threaten, bully and assault the people who get in these boats, and have absolutely no regard for human life.",2
"We simply have to break their business model and bring them to justice The Government’s new plan for immigration, which will be put into law through the Nationality and Borders Bill, is a long-term solution to deterring illegal migration and addressing underlying pull factors in the UK’s asylum system.",3
"It will bring in a range of new measures, including: a one-stop appeals process; the ability to process claims outside the country; the ability to declare inadmissible to our asylum system those who arrive in the UK having passed through safe countries; and life sentences for people smugglers.",3
People should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.,4
"I have approved maritime tactics, including boat turnarounds, for Border Force to deploy.",3
"It is an essential element in finding a long-term solution to a problem that successive Home Secretaries have faced As we mourn those who have died in the most horrendous circumstances, I hope that the whole House can come together and send a message that crossing the channel in a small boat is not the way to come to our country.",3
"It is unnecessary, illegal and, above all, desperately unsafe.",2
"What evidence can the Minister share with the House that people smugglers “threaten … bully and assault the people who get into these boats” What evidence is there that asylum seekers, who must know that they are in France, or at the very least in mainland Europe, who are getting into boats, do not know that they are coming to the UK The Home Secretary gives the impression that vulnerable people are being forced against their will into these boats.",3
Surely people traffickers would be only too happy to save money on boats and leave those who had already paid them in mainland Europe?,4
"Is it not the truth that these desperate people, who often speak English and no other European language, and who often have relatives or other people they know in the UK, know that they cannot seek asylum in the UK unless they are in the UK The Home Secretary says that people traffickers “use the money they make for other heinous crimes” What are the heinous crimes to which the Home Secretary is referring?",3
"She also talked about a “wide range of operational and diplomatic work” How can the Home Secretary talk about boat turnarounds the day after at least 27 people lost their lives, given that it is a tactic that can only increase the risk of further tragic deaths On diplomatic work, Ministers have talked about processing asylum claims in places such as Albania and Ascension Island.",3
"Is it not the case that, rather than pointing the finger at the French, who take more asylum seekers per head of population than the UK, or at the people traffickers, whom Clare Moseley of Care4Calais described as a symptom of the problem and not its cause, the Government should look in the mirror?",3
The problem is reducing the UK foreign aid budget.,3
The problem is UK foreign policy failures.,2
The problem with channel crossings is that this Government refuse to allow people to claim asylum unless their feet are on British soil.,2
"Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May), who have made their point—and, in fact, my point—extremely clearly Instead, I will focus on the integrated review and the merger of the Departments, and what it actually means according to the statements of Her Majesty’s Government compared with the actions on the ground.",3
"My former colleagues in the Ministry of Defence will not like this terribly, but I support the idea of having a Foreign Secretary who is the strategic mind for the British Government overseas, including on the deployment of, for example, carriers.",3
"The same is true, I am afraid, in respect of aid spending; there is a technical expertise here that is not the same as the strategic oversight of foreign policy, which is why I would like to see some of this coming back and being reinforced as the technical skill it really is Let us look at a few examples.",3
"That is not just good for Lebanon, which is facing the crisis of a quarter or a third of its population being migrants—refugees forced over from the Syrian civil war—and nor is it just a good moment for the middle east, because it creates a link into various forms of support into other countries, but it is brilliant for Britain.",3
That applies particularly to immigration and housing.,2
"Brexit was won not because people like me were wittering on about parliamentary sovereignty for many years, but on the issue of immigration, and people in the midlands and the north of England feeling that their Government were out of touch on immigration I welcome the new Bill that is being promoted.",3
"The fact is, though, that there are perhaps a million people in this country whom we do not know about who are here illegally.",2
What really angers people is seeing these daily pictures of illegal crossings on the channel.,2
"I believe that the only way to stop that is to make it a criminal offence to try to enter this country illegally—one that, if proven, would entail a custodial sentence and deportation.",2
"Therefore, we have to commit ourselves to international aid and overseas development.",3
"The language of our politics is important, especially when we are discussing immigration and refugees.",3
I place on record again that it is legal for people to seek sanction or asylum; it is not illegal and we should stop labelling people as illegal This year is the 25th anniversary of Show Racism the Red Card and I am chair of the all-party parliamentary group.,3
"Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah) where we mentioned that it is important to get the tone and language of our politics right when we are discussing those issues I have seen Show Racism the Red Card at a school in Glasgow South West telling schoolchildren in excellent terms the difference between an asylum seeker, a refugee and an economic migrant.",3
"Again, I hope that the Government will consider giving asylum seekers the right to work in this country after six months, because I think that they should have that right In general, the Government have had some recent difficulties.",3
"It is the reluctance of immigrant women—it is usually women—suffering domestic abuse to go to the police for help because they fear that information will be shared with immigration authorities Last week, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner published a report entitled Safety Before Status, and one of her recommendations is that “the Home Office should introduce a firewall between police and immigration enforcement, accompanied by safe reporting mechanisms” I cannot resist saying that it continues “and funded referral pathways to support.” Perpetrators can use a victim’s insecure status as a component of coercive control.",3
"If victims are to come first, it is essential that they know that they can seek support without putting themselves in danger of deportation.",3
"There are a number of very difficult consequences—that is putting it too mildly The commissioner’s report says: “Immigration abuse and insecure immigration status as a risk factor is not always identified in local safeguarding protocols, and often the risk faced by victims … is misidentified.” She goes on: “Information sharing with immigration enforcement undermines trust in the police and public services”— a point that has been made this evening— “and enables perpetrators to control and abuse survivors with impunity.",3
A key reason why staff in public services share information with immigration enforcement is for the perceived purpose of safeguarding a victim.,3
"Data sharing in this capacity, however, can put the victim or survivor at risk … and, even where enforcement action does not take place can compound the experience of immigration abuse, pushing victims and survivors further away from support.” I could not let this group go by without raising that issue.",3
"The first thing I want to say is that the Government highly value the service of all members of our Armed Forces, including: our Commonwealth nationals, our Gurkhas in Nepal, who have a long and distinguished history of service to the UK both here and overseas; and former British Hong Kong service personnel Before I address the detail of the proposed new clauses, I would like to say a few words about the process for setting immigration fees.",3
Application fees for immigration and nationality applications have been charged for a number of years.,3
"They play a vital role in our country’s ability to run a sustainable borders and immigration system, reducing the burden that falls on taxpayers Sitting beneath the Immigration Act are a fees order and fees regulations, all of which are scrutinised by both Houses before they come into effect; there is a democratic prism to all this.",3
"This system ensures checks and balances, and it seeks to maintain the coherence of the immigration fees framework as set out in legislation.",3
"It would also reduce clarity in the fees structure by creating an alternative mechanism for controlling fees which sits outside the immigration fees regime When non-UK service personnel, including Commonwealth citizens and Gurkhas from Nepal, enlist in the regular Armed Forces, they are granted exemption from immigration control status for the duration of their service.",3
"They are free from any requirements to make visa applications or pay any fees while they serve, and that is unlike almost every other category of migrant coming to work in the UK.",4
"To address the driver shortage, the Transport Secretary is introducing temporary visas, tackling testing backlogs and changing cabotage requirements, and is today announcing new funding to improve lorry park facilities.",3
"I told the House that when we met our fiscal tests, we would return to spending 0.7% of our national income on overseas aid.",3
"Our integrated rail plan will be published soon, dramatically improving journey times between our towns and cities.",3
"It is why today’s Budget increases the British Business Bank’s regional financing programmes to £1.6 billion, expanding their coverage and helping innovative businesses get access to the finance they need, across the whole United Kingdom A third of our science Nobel laureates have been immigrants.",3
Half of our fastest growing companies have a foreign-born founder.,3
"Thanks to our brilliant Home Secretary, today’s Budget confirms the eligibility criteria for our new scale-up visa, making it quicker and easier for fast-growing businesses to bring in highly skilled individuals.",3
"It is all part of our plan to make our visa system for international talent the most competitive in the world If we want greater private sector innovation, we need to make our research and development tax reliefs fit for purpose.",3
"So a £22-billion investment in R&D, the net zero strategy, the future fund, Help to Grow, more regional finance, unlocking institutional capital, a more competitive visa system and a modernised R&D tax credits regime—enough action to prove the hypothesis that we are making this country a science and technology superpower As well as investing in infrastructure and innovation, there is one further part of our plan for growth that is crucial: providing a world-class education to all our people.",3
"Members: “Hear, hear.”] This is a tax on working people and we are cutting it from 63% to 55%, the rate originally envisaged by my right hon.",3
"The Home Office has a poor record in relation to Covid-19 safety, having already been warned by the High Court about its approach to the asylum system in this regard.",3
"Following what happened at Napier barracks, what is the position at the Brook House immigration removal centre?",3
"Were any of those on the scheduled deportation flight to Zimbabwe, whom the Government said were all foreign national offenders, people who were awaiting a Covid-19 test result; had tested positive themselves; or should have been, or were, self-isolating for 10 days because they had come into contact with somebody with Covid-19?",3
"But just as this was not inevitable, or indeed unexpected, so it is not inevitable that all we can do is despair The Taliban said on Monday that those who worked with foreign forces have nothing to fear as long as they show remorse.",3
"Or there is the man who has been trying to get his wife out since 2018 but, because of covid, her visa was delayed Numbers matter less than need.",3
We need to reject this artificial distinction between resettlement and asylum.,2
"I am pleased to hear the Prime Minister commit not to send people back, but I hope the Home Secretary was listening, because the same Ministers who proudly boast about stopping boats forget to tell us that it is Afghans on those boats—people who have been fleeing this situation Instead of posturing, we need to challenge Macron and our European partners, and work with them, to ensure that everybody does their fair share to help.",3
We must not let people divide us here or overseas in the fight for those values.,2
"However, in passing this legislation we must ensure that someone’s migrant status does not prevent them from getting the support that they need One of the greatest challenges in tackling the abhorrent crime of domestic abuse is the fact that all too often incidents go unreported.",3
The problem is further exacerbated if victims are afraid to come forward because they fear that doing so could lead to their deportation.,2
"Everyone, no matter their migration status, deserves equal protection under the law Lords amendment 40, on data sharing for immigration purposes, is therefore a huge opportunity to reassure victims and witnesses that the details they share with the police and other agencies will not be used for any immigration-control purposes.",3
The stress caused is unmanageable if victims are having to secure their right to remain in the UK at the same time The situation is made worse by the policies that limit access to some key services for those subject to immigration control.,3
"Not only do we have a moral responsibility to enact the changes in the Lords amendments but, as signatories to the Istanbul convention on preventing violence against women and girls, we have an international responsibility, too One of the remaining hurdles in the way of full implementation of the convention is equal protection on the grounds of migrant or refugee status.",3
I am proud to say that on 31 January the Government launched the Hong Kong British national overseas immigration route.,3
"It is an unprecedented and generous offer and reflects the historical and moral commitment of this country to the individuals who retained ties with the UK at the point of Hong Kong’s handover Through this route, we will welcome BNO status holders and their family members to the UK on a pathway to citizenship.",4
"From 23 February, those with a BNO, Hong Kong special administrative region or European economic area biometric passport will be able to apply for the route through the fully digitalised process, using new technology developed through the UK’s points-based immigration system.",3
"I am clear that we must give BNO status holders every opportunity to thrive in the UK, and officials are working with colleagues across Departments to look at integration.",3
"The Government have made it clear that they want to change the law to make it easier and swifter to deport illegal immigrants, foreign national offenders and those making bogus claims for asylum.",3
"It is therefore deeply regrettable that, despite that sacrifice, they are facing shameful treatment when gaining visas and regularising their immigration status.",3
"During their service, Commonwealth personnel are exempt from immigration controls, but within 28 days of their discharge they must either apply for some form of leave to remain or return to their country of origin.",3
"These men fought for our country and are now living here in limbo, fearing destitution and deportation To their credit, the Government have acknowledged that there is a problem and have taken some steps to ameliorate the harm that is being done.",3
"The Home Secretary promised me that she was working to correct the situation, and the Veterans Minister has stated his intention to launch a public consultation to introduce a path to citizenship.",3
"My Lords, this group of amendments is on the key issue of protections for migrant victims of domestic abuse who have no recourse to public funds, an issue which has been raised by Members across all sides in both Houses.",3
The amendment also provides for a review into the operation of this change to be commissioned by the Secretary of State There are currently no provisions in the Bill for migrant women facing domestic abuse who have no recourse to public funds.,3
This is despite their abusers being able to use the immigration status of a victim and their consequential inability to have any access to public funds as a means of control.,3
"It can be almost impossible for migrant women to escape from their abusers if they have no money to gain access, for example, to a refuge or other accommodation.",3
"They are often fearful too of any perceived or actual threat of action by their abusers, or their own actions, that would bring them to the attention of the immigration authorities and possible subsequent immigration enforcement and separation from their children The situation is not helped by the fact that it is the same department—the Home Office—that deals with immigration issues, including deportation, and support for victims of domestic abuse, which gives rise to our concern that a victim should always be treated as a person in need of support and not first and foremost as an immigration case The Commons Home Affairs Committee stated: “Insecure immigration status must not bar victims of abuse from protection and access to justice” and the Joint Committee on the draft Domestic Abuse Bill said: “We recommend that Government explores ways to extend the temporary concessions available … to support migrant survivors of abuse.” The Sun also, I believe, gave its support to protecting migrant women in this Bill when it said: “Domestic abusers don’t discriminate, so why should the law discriminate against their victims?” No recourse to public funds, NRPF, is a legal restriction that bars people on certain visas from claiming most benefits, tax credits or housing assistance paid for by the state.",3
"This would apply, for example, in respect of someone on a student visa.",3
"It also applies when migrant women, including their children, become a victim of domestic violence, when the restriction hinders their ability to access life-saving refuge support and other necessary welfare provisions Amendment 148 would remove the statutory exclusion that prevents migrant survivors accessing the support and assistance they need and would ensure that no survivor, whatever their immigration status, was treated as being in breach of immigration laws or Immigration Rules by accessing that support or assistance.",3
"Without recourse to public funds, migrant victims of domestic abuse are not eligible to welfare benefits needed to cover the cost of a stay in a refuge service.",3
"The chances of a migrant woman being able to access a refuge are slim, bordering on impossible The experiences of survivors with no recourse to public funds, unable to access a refuge, are grim.",3
"We should not be turning away victims of domestic violence from refuges because of what it does or does not say on their passport, and we should not leave survivors with the only option of sleeping on the streets, with any children, if they are desperate to leave an abusive relationship Migrant survivors are often too scared to report domestic abuse as they could then be investigated and even detained.",3
They cannot access safe accommodation and their abusers use their immigration status as a tool of coercive control over them.,2
"It is often the case that the perpetrator is in control of the incomes and the bank accounts Women without secure immigration status are prevented from renting accommodation, which also means that refuges can find it difficult to take them.",3
"At the most vulnerable point in their lives, these migrant women need to be believed and to be told that they can be helped.",3
"Migrant women are not migrants first and foremost; they are mothers, neighbours, and colleagues in workplaces—for example, care workers and NHS workers.",3
"Surely, the solution to the problems many migrant women who suffer domestic abuse face is to give them access to housing benefit, ensure that they can access welfare support and allow them to rent accommodation.",3
I signed amendment as someone who worked for many years supporting women from BAME and migrant communities who were victims of domestic violence.,3
"I helped establish a user-led, BAME women’s centre, IMECE, which for over 25 years has helped thousands of Turkish-Kurdish, Turkish-Cypriot and other migrant women, mainly across London, to access services and be given support.",3
Research found that 46% of migrant women were often failing to access support by the police when reporting abuse.,3
They do not address the well-known barriers to reporting faced by victims of domestic abuse which are a particular problem for migrant victims.,3
"When it comes to support for these victims, they are faced with the chronic underfunding of specialist services run by and for BAME women which have the expertise, knowledge and links In December, I saw a report that the police watchdog advised that police should share less information with immigration officials about abused or trafficked women.",3
Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary said that women do not report abuse for fear of deportation.,3
"The specialist organisations that I referred to, which have provided such unique advice and information and shared their experience with us in the formulation of this very welcome Bill, are uniquely placed to support migrant women to get help and rebuild their lives after abuse.",3
"For example, Imkaan reported that 43% of the requests for violence against women and girls support to BAME specialists were from women needing support in connection with immigration-related issues.",3
"We heard that 60% of women who approached Southall Black Sisters, which has been around for many decades doing excellent work, for support have insecure immigration status.",3
"The organisation I referred to, IMECE, with which I worked extensively, also reports that a significant proportion of women seeking its help were migrant women or refugees.",3
The fact that perpetrators use immigration status as a weapon to continue to control and abuse is well-known and a reality.,2
The current local authority duty proposal in the Bill will do nothing to tackle the barriers that BAME and migrant survivors face in accessing refuge space unless there is a clear legal commitment to resourcing equal access by introducing a non-discrimination clause There has been much support for a truly non-discriminatory component to be enshrined in this important Bill.,3
"The Minister in the other place has already stated that it should ensure that, “all victims of domestic abuse are treated first and foremost as victims, regardless of their immigration status.”—[Official Report, Commons, 28/4/20; col. 299] If this Bill is to be truly transformational, enshrining a non-discrimination principle is the only way to ensure that we do not have a two-tier policy where society’s most isolated and marginalised victims cannot get the support and justice they desperately need, and are left to suffer in limbo with no legal protection.",3
"There should be no hiding place for perpetrators and we cannot have a subsector of victims, a small but significant group of migrant women, who are left with little support and equality.",3
"Many of these matters are central to a well-functioning society, including the recovery of our justice system in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic; the prevention of violent crime and the delivery of justice for victims; the basis and operation of our constitutional settlement; the way that our immigration and asylum systems work in practice; and how the United Kingdom will respond to digital and technological developments, including online safety and the security of our communications.",3
"We expect to increase the flexibility provided to judges by ensuring, among other things, that more flexible and effective remedies are available, and to review the merits of the Supreme Court’s decision in Cart Our desire to ensure that our society’s vital systems function as fairly and as effectively as possible extends to our plans for the borders Bill that we will introduce.",3
This will implement the most significant overhaul of our immigration and asylum systems for decades At the heart of this Bill is a simple principle: fairness.,3
"Presently, we have a generous asylum system that offers protection to the most vulnerable people around the world through defined safe and legal routes.",3
"But this system is collapsing under the pressure of parallel, often extremely dangerous, illegal routes to asylum, facilitated by criminals smuggling people into the UK We believe that access to our asylum system should be based on need and not on the ability to pay people smugglers.",3
"We will introduce new powers to target the increasing use of vessels by criminal gangs to facilitate illegal entry to the UK Over and above that, our ability to enforce immigration laws, passed by and with the authority of Parliament, is being impeded, contributing to a downward trend in the number of people, including foreign national offenders, being removed from the UK.",3
"Our time and resources should be directed to protecting and supporting those in genuine need of asylum, and to reclaim control of our borders.",3
"It will include the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation, requiring platforms and search engines contained within its scope to tackle illegal content and protect our young people from harmful material Major platforms will also be required to set out, with clarity, their own terms and conditions about legal but harmful content for adults, and to enforce these rules consistently and transparently The Bill will also enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.",3
"We will do this through reform of the Official Secrets Acts 1911, 1920 and 1939, as well as the Official Secrets Act 1989, and the creation of a foreign influence registration scheme.",3
"We will ensure that our police, judges and border officials have the powers necessary to secure our society and protect our citizens.",3
"Sedition has its roots in the perceived unfairness of society, and draconian punishment is one of those unfairnesses In their immigration proposals, the Government seek to penalise legitimate asylum seekers, contrary to our international obligations on refugee resettlement.",3
"There is currently no way for those being bombed in Syria by their own President, or those caught between warring factions in Yemen, to claim asylum within their own country.",4
"All UK resettlement schemes are currently closed, with no plans or timetable for reopening them, nor for establishing new ones Instead of first establishing or re-establishing resettlement schemes and setting targets for the number of asylum seekers to whom the UK will give sanctuary, the Government are spending millions of pounds on barbed wire and enforcement patrols on the French coast.",3
"They are forcing legitimate asylum seekers into the hands of people traffickers—the only people who know how to get around the increased security measures One people smuggler, quoted by the Guardian, said: “We thank your government for our full pockets.” If you say to voters in the red or blue wall, “Look at these illegal immigrants crossing the channel”, you encourage xenophobia.",3
"It is a choice, and the Conservative Government, through their immigration proposals, are choosing the former In the year of the 40th anniversary of the Brixton riots, this Conservative Government choose to ignore the recommendations of the Scarman report and instead condone enforcing the law over maintenance of the Queen’s peace, as we saw at the Clapham Common vigil.",3
"My Lords, the new plan for immigration will, we are told, increase the asylum system’s “fairness and efficacy”.",3
"We certainly need more fairness and efficacy, but the Law Society and refugee and human rights groups warn that this plan spells the opposite, with “dire consequences for children and young people”, according to the Children’s Society I can do no better than to cite the UNHCR’s devastating critique.",3
"This “discriminatory two-tiered approach … will undermine the 1951 Convention and international protection system, not just in the UK, but globally.” A commitment to resettlement and improved safe and legal pathways, which are urgently needed but for which there is no detail, cannot, “substitute for or absolve a State of its obligations towards persons seeking asylum at its borders” The inferior temporary protection status offered to irregular entrants who stay in the UK is incompatible with international refugee law.",3
"More positive is the commitment to correct what is described as “historical anomalies in British Nationality law which have long prevented individuals from gaining British citizenship or registering for citizenship, through no fault of their own.” This is a real injustice suffered by the children of British Overseas Territory citizens of a certain age, denied citizenship simply because their parents were not married.",3
"It should have been rectified years ago With regard to registering for citizenship, there has been a long-standing concern across the House about the barriers faced by children who were born or have grown up in the UK who have to register their entitlement to citizenship because of their parents’ immigration status.",3
"I want to say something about refugee policy and add a few words, perhaps at the end, about the press and electronic media and, if time allows, a little bit about delays in the courts I hope when we get the borders Bill that, as a result of the consultation going on, it will be much improved compared with the policy statement of last March.",3
I believe firmly that the method of travel should not determine the right to asylum.,3
I further believe that such discrimination would be illegal and a breach of the 1951 Geneva Convention.,3
"Is there any reason to think that European countries would accept the return of asylum seekers who, according our Government, have travelled here by the wrong route?",4
"If that policy—which our Government want—was adopted by all countries, the accident of geography would mean that Greece, Italy, and Malta would have had to accept thousands, indeed millions, of people who reached those countries for safety Obviously, we in this country cannot take all refugees.",3
"The Government have closed the two main routes for child refugees in Europe, both under my amendment to the 2016 Act and by not seeking to negotiate the continuation of the family reunion provisions of the Dublin treaty, which expired at the end of December when we left the EU.",3
It is important that the Government ensure that there are safe routes to the UK for refugees.,3
"Clearly, we need safe routes for refugees to come into the UK Secondly, we should give priority to the family reunion rights for refugees.",3
"What could be a more fundamental right than the family reunion of people who have fled danger in their country Thirdly, what is to happen to the child refugees who are now in northern France or on the Greek islands?",3
"In effect, we are saying, “There is no legal route for you and you have to take your chances on the back of lorries or in unsafe boats and dinghies”—something the Government have been anxious to prevent.",3
She wrote that “no one puts their children in a boat unless the water is safer than the land” That seems a clear summary of what we should be about as a country I turn briefly to the internet safety Bill and related measures.,3
"At best, the Bill is an overreaction to occasional unacceptable behaviour by protestors, which is probably illegal at present anyway—a point also made by the noble Baroness, Lady Fox of Buckley In the Bill, the Government’s consistent emphasis on the so-called tough crackdown, longer sentences and increased police powers never falters.",3
"An attack on JR would threaten the rule of law and would be an unacceptable political response to a mistaken criticism of alleged judicial overreach, largely fuelled by the Government’s reaction to the Miller decisions On the proposed sovereign borders Bill, making asylum claims inadmissible for illegal entrants sounds, at first blush, justifiable.",3
"This proposal ignores the fact that many who run untold risks, sustain all manner of hardship and finally manage to find their way here, albeit illegally, have had no possible means of securing the visas that they would have required to enter legally.",3
We have a long tradition of offering sanctuary to the persecuted and to refugees.,4
We are not talking only of justifiably outlawing people-smugglers but of making the grant of asylum dependent on authorised legal entry.,3
"I would add that, for all the elegance of his language and his clearly good intentions, we profoundly disagree with the approach of the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, to immigration and changes in the ethnic make-up of our society, which we believe do not weaken this nation but enrich and enhance it, just as the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, described The Government’s plans for reform of the Mental Health Act are welcome, particularly the proposals to reform the process of mental health detention, to deal more humanely with autistic people and to improve the management of offenders with mental disorders.",3
"Finally, I add to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Garnier, said last Wednesday on the subject of criminalising coercive and controlling behaviour by charlatan counsellors or so-called psychotherapists who peddle their services to take over the lives of troubled young people, implant false memories of abuse by parents and families during childhood and create a dependence on themselves, alienating these vulnerable young adults from their parents and families in a damaging cycle of coercive control over their lives.",3
"Platforms must consider and introduce safeguards for freedom of expression when setting out their safety policies The Bill will define three categories of harm to individuals: illegal content, content that is harmful to children and legal content that is harmful to adults.",3
"We will continue to operate a high-quality regime that promotes growth and innovation and underpins the trustworthy use of data The noble Lords, Lord Green of Deddington, Lord Paddick, Lord Marks of Henley-on-Thames and Lord Dubs, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, and the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Moulsecoomb, asked about immigration.",3
"We want to welcome those who come to the UK through safe and legal routes, and to crack down on criminal gangs that facilitate dangerous and illegal journeys.",3
"An asylum system should not reward those who enter the UK illegally while other vulnerable people, including women and children, are pushed aside The noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, pressed me on where we are with the Dubs scheme.",3
"We will prioritise resettling refugees from areas of conflict and instability, rather than those who are already in safe European countries.",3
"We will maintain clear, well-defined routes for refugees in need of protection, ensuring that refugees have the freedom to succeed and the ability to integrate and contribute fully to society when they arrive in the UK The noble Baroness, Lady Lister, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, and the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, asked about our international obligations and returns agreements.",3
"This legislation will be compliant with our international obligations, including the European Convention on Human Rights and the 1951 refugee convention.",3
This is an established principle of any functioning migration relationship and it enables us to maintain public confidence in our immigration system.,3
"It has seen 29,000 family reunion visas issued in the last five years, with more than half of those issued to children I am aware that I am probably over time, but I assure noble Lords that I will be finished very shortly.",3
"They were model parliamentarians and great friends, and we are far poorer in this House for their passing Illegal entry to the UK via small boats is unsafe, unfair and unacceptable.",3
Our new plan for immigration and the Nationality and Borders Bill will address the challenge of illegal immigration by increasing maximum sentences for people smugglers and making it easier to swiftly remove those who enter the UK illegally.,3
"Following the ridiculous decision by the Crown Prosecution Service not to prosecute illegal migrants on the grounds that they have “no choice in how they travel”, as if they do not voluntarily pay a people smuggler €10,000 or voluntarily get in a dinghy, or the even more absurd reason that we can rely on “administrative removal channels” when corrupt human rights lawyers string such claims out for years and nobody is ever deported, where does that leave the absolutely good Bill of my right hon.",3
"There is no plan to weaken or undermine the refugee family reunion provisions that have been used by 29,000 people in the last six years.",3
"Because we have these effective and well-used safe and legal routes, it is reasonable—indeed, it is our responsibility—to clamp down on the people smugglers who are exploiting migrants and charging them money to make an unnecessary and dangerous journey, often across the English channel from France, which is patently a safe country.",3
No one needs to leave France to claim asylum.,3
"Gentleman’s question, I am afraid that he has not read the Bill, or the new plan for immigration, or followed the debate and the discussion.",3
"It is our objective as a Government to support those individuals, but not those who come to our country by paying money to illegal people traffickers and who could have claimed asylum in many of the EU countries through which they have travelled.",4
"I am sorry that he fails to realise that flagrant abuses are taking place through the use of people smugglers and people traffickers, and that individuals could claim asylum in other countries, but are simply choosing not to do so.",3
"Friend the Member for Torbay (Kevin Foster), who has sadly suffered a family bereavement and therefore cannot be here this morning Covid-19 has had a major and unprecedented impact on the asylum system.",3
"All asylum seekers housed at Napier have access to a 24/7 advice service, provided for the Home Office by Migrant Help Napier barracks has been happily used for many years by Army and police personnel.",3
"It rejected the claim that conditions at Napier amounted to “inhuman or degrading treatment.” The judge declined to rule that dormitories or barrack accommodation could never provide “adequate accommodation” for asylum seekers, and the judge rejected the claim that the expectation that residents would be back on site by 10pm amounted to a curfew or unlawful imprisonment Furthermore, the judgment was based on conditions in the past, before several significant improvements.",3
"Through our new plans for immigration and the upcoming sovereign borders Bill, this Government are taking action to increase the fairness and efficiency of our asylum system but also to fight illegal and unnecessary migration, such as that by small boats coming across the English Channel.",3
"As a refugee called Ngozi told the Joint Committee on Human Rights on Wednesday: “We remain children to our parents even when we are over 18.” The Conservative MP and former Home Office Minister, Caroline Nokes, said in the debate on Afghanistan in the other place on 18 August: “Our children do not suddenly become independent because they pass a day over their 18th birthday, so refugee family reunion in this instance has to ensure that those girls are able to come here.",3
"To answer her question, I think none of us would regard it as remotely reasonable to make a family contemplate leaving a 19 or even 25 year-old daughter in Afghanistan to the mercy of the Taliban, or indeed in a refugee camp or unsafe situation anywhere.",3
"It is entirely possible—indeed, it happens—for there to be delays in deciding an asylum case such that a child who was well under 18 when the asylum application was made turns 18 while waiting for a decision.",3
We know that some decisions can take many years The Home Affairs Select Committee called it “perverse” to deny refugee children the right to bring close family to join them in the same way as adults.,3
"The traditional Home Office objection is that a child may be sent ahead as a peg or anchor, to justify a whole family being able to secure refugee status.",3
"Allowing refugee children to sponsor immediate family would, in fact, reduce the number taking irregular journeys The Bill also reintroduces provision for legal aid, which was withdrawn in 2012 on the basis that applications for family reunion were, according to the Ministry of Justice, “straightforward”.",3
"There was an order in 2019 making provision for legal aid in the case of separated migrant children, either under the Immigration Rules or outside the rules, on the basis of exceptional circumstances or compassionate and compelling factors, but I do not know how many cases have benefited from this.",3
The inspector of borders found many errors needing to be overturned on appeal or refusals resulting in further applications.,3
"Let us say that it is below £10 million, and it will save money all through the system To conclude, the case for a more generous approach to family reunion for refugees is based on both humanitarian grounds—which, I contend, are very strong—and the hard-headed case that reunited families allow refugees to find their feet more quickly, integrate better and contribute more fully, to the benefit of themselves, their community, the country and the Treasury.",3
"Since then, we have had cuts to the aid budget and a new asylum policy, but the wider context is not that dissimilar.",3
Settlement in a new country is extremely important to a refugee’s well-being and to how the whole community functions.,3
"We are told that the participants in the public focus group organised by the Home Office “agreed that unaccompanied asylum-seeking children should be reunited with their family member(s) in the UK, where possible.” We are told: “In the deep dive, stakeholders advocated for … removing financial requirements for sponsors, and lowering the evidence threshold, including on demonstrating family links.” However, the Government’s response is that there could be “unintended consequences” through those changes.",3
"The response says: “Overall, we consider the case has not been made for the government to adopt a different approach in relation to fees, financial requirements and the need to meet relevant evidence thresholds for children, including UASC seeking to join nonparent refugee relatives in the UK.” It says, “We consider this”—that is, the proposed changes— “has the potential to attract a very high number of applications” What do the Government consider to be a very high number?",3
My friend wrote: “I try to imagine what it must have been like to leave the only place you had ever known and to travel across the sea to a foreign country where you didn’t speak a word of the language.,3
"Lea, not much more than a child, had to trek 1,500 kilometres to Hamburg, the German port, where ships were harboured waiting to convey thousands of hopeful immigrants to England.",3
"Obviously, it is a shame that her wholly sensible, practical and humane measure is even necessary, but I am afraid it is becoming more essential by the day Like the current Home Secretary, I am the daughter of migrants to this country.",3
"However, it seems that this shared experience appears to have instilled rather contrasting approaches to refugees on our respective parts.",3
In the summer of 1940 little boats in the English Channel came to symbolise the Dunkirk rescue and Britain’s defiance of Hitler.,3
"Now it seems that little boats of desperate people are to be repelled or even sunk, in clear contravention of the refugee convention and even clearer contravention of common decency Ministerial answers to this charge plead that they are merely seeking to deter the evil trade in people smuggling or words to that effect: that the answer to the greatest refugee crisis since World War II is not such dangerous and mercenary human traffic, but safe routes to our shores.",3
"Her short and simple measure not only provides safe routes but plugs an obscene and discriminatory gap in protection that denies refugee children the right to bring parents and siblings to join them in safety, and she offers those seeking family reunion legal aid.",3
"No less than Albert Einstein had already been denied asylum here, having to go on to find it in the United States.",3
"Sylvia Pankhurst pleaded with the Home Office via the Manchester Guardian: “May we not plead for somewhat more humanity in dealing with these cases?” I suspect that the Minister might not find the red suffragettes so compelling, so I will try these words instead: “I am a refugee in a crowded boat foundering off the coast of Vietnam, I am a Laotian, a Cambodian, a Cuban and a Miskito Indian in Nicaragua.” Today we could add a desperate person in a dinghy in the English Channel.",3
"My Lords, I am not going to talk about the foreign policy, military or security aspects of the catastrophe in Afghanistan.",2
"I am not equipped to do so, and many others in this debate are, not least the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, who has just spoken My only inquest question is to ask why a plan for refugees emerged only last night and why there was no contingency scheme ready to announce an action well before Kabul fell.",3
Why is the process for issuing visas protracted and bureaucratic?,2
"Much as one can admire the heroism of our ambassador Laurie Bristow in administering visas at the airport, this is not the image of simplified and fast-tracked applications and evacuation that one would expect I second what others have said about the UK aid budget, but I also urge the Government to scale up our support for the UN’s refugee agency, the UNHCR.",3
"Resources, as well as diplomatic influence, must also be used to support neighbouring countries to keep their borders open, in order to provide safe havens to refugees fleeing Afghanistan—as they have long done The Home Secretary has announced a UK Afghan resettlement scheme of 20,000 over a number of years, drawing comparisons with the seven-year scheme for Syrians.",3
"What funding—genuinely new funding—will there be for local councils to house, support and integrate those refugees, without placing even more strain on their overstretched budgets I will not repeat what others have said about the ARAP scheme, which must be expanded to contractors.",3
"I draw attention to the Bill that I have in progress on refugee family reunion, which has its Second Reading on 10 September, and I invite more speakers.",3
"There is no special place for the UK when the US President makes crucial foreign policy decisions, even when we have contributed military, intelligence and diplomatic support to the US-led efforts in Afghanistan, including substantial development assistance Our response to this latest development has been closer to that of our European allies than to that of the USA, but we have excluded ourselves from the multilateral foreign policy networks that Mrs Thatcher’s Government helped to establish with other European Governments, so we have struggled to consult multiple capitals one by one.",3
"The Government are now calling for collective action on the likely surge of refugees towards Europe and the threats of increased drugs trafficking and transnational terrorism, so we will share our sovereignty with our neighbours in devising common responses to challenges that spill over international borders.",3
The integrated review is now inoperable.,3
"My Lords, my experience over many years has been in dealing with the human cost of wars: in supporting and helping refugees, those who have fled conflict and oppression, particularly girls and women.",3
"Refugees are not migrants; they are not illegal people, and it is time that we stopped seeing the demonisation of these human beings.",2
"For those like my friends who have passports and those with documentation, there is no point if Kabul airport remains inaccessible to them.",3
Can the Minister assure us that more will be done in the coming days to increase the issue of visas and that charter flights will be used to airlift vulnerable Afghans?,3
"My Lords, I join those who have already spoken of their gratitude to those who have contributed so much in the past 20 years in Afghanistan, but I want to speak on what actions we can take at once in this country The Home Office will have to recalibrate its whole approach to refugees.",3
"In 2015, a British court ordered that deportations to Afghanistan be suspended because the country was unsafe.",3
"This entire mindset needs urgently to be reversed As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and others declared, the Home Office should now offer an amnesty to all Afghan asylum seekers already here and make it easier for families to be reunited.",3
Emergency visas should be made easily available to those most at risk.,3
"Britain’s offer of asylum to, at most, 20,000 over five years is not fast enough—or enough; 5,000 now will not meet the immediate demand Much attention has already been paid—rightly—to the plight of women under the new Taliban Government.",3
"With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: New clause 13—National self-care strategy— “(1) The Secretary of State must prepare a National Self-Care Strategy to fully integrate self-care for minor ailments into the wider health system (2) The National Self-Care Strategy must have regard to the need to— (a) address inequalities in health literacy; (b) enhance the understanding of primary and secondary age children on how to self-care; (c) introduce self-care modules in healthcare professionals’ training curricula and continuing professional development; (d) make best use of, and expand, the Community Pharmacist Consultation Service; (e) improve access to effective self-care treatments; (f) enable community pharmacists to refer people directly to other healthcare professionals; (g) ensure better support for primary care networks to deliver self-care; (h) evaluate the use of technologies that have been developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to promote greater self-care; and (i) accelerate efforts to enable community pharmacists to populate medical records.” This new clause would ensure that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care publishes a national self-care strategy to integrate self-care for minor ailments into the health system.",3

The main way of achieving that is to stop the boats setting off; that must be the priority and it is why the Government have offered to help the French in any way that we can to try to stop those boats launching.,3
"Under the Nationality and Borders Bill, which the Opposition opposed, we are trying to make it easier for people to make legal claims for asylum, and harder for people who come into the country illegally to make claims.",3
"That must be right, because the evil of what happens is the people traffickers and smugglers who are entirely unconcerned about human life and take large amounts of money to put people on unsafe boats and push them out to sea at the risk of their lives.",2
"I announced that the borders Bill will be coming back, and I hope that the Opposition will seriously consider supporting those many measures and supporting the Bill’s Third Reading, which will help us to ensure safer borders On Windrush, the Government are committed to ensuring that those compensation payments are paid.",3

"They threaten, intimidate, bully and assault the people who get into these boats, and they have an absolute disregard for human life.",2
"We simply have to break their business model and, of course, bring them to justice The Government’s new plan for immigration, which will be put into law through the Nationality and Borders Bill, is a longer-term solution that will address many of these underlying factors to deter illegal migration and address underlying pull factors in the UK’s asylum system.",3
"It will bring in a range of measures, including a one-stop appeals process; the ability to process claims outside the country; the ability to have differentiation and declare inadmissible to our asylum system those who arrive in the UK having passed through safe countries; and life sentences for people smugglers.",3

"It is of course unnecessary, illegal and desperately unsafe.",2
"That is exactly how it works The reality is that it is not the case that everyone who has come to this country illegally, whether on the back of a lorry or in a small boat, historically, is an asylum seeker.",3

"Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes) on securing this important debate It is a rich irony that as we hold this debate to mark Windrush Day, another immigration scandal similar to that which affected the Windrush generation is potentially in the making.",3
"It is important for their sake, as well as for the sake of the wider black, Asian and minority ethnic community, that we do not miss the opportunity of this debate to address the reasons why so many of the Windrush generation and their descendants were wrongly detained, deported and denied legal rights It is important to be clear about what Wendy Williams identified in her “Windrush Lessons Learned Review”, in which she said: “While the Windrush scandal began to become public in late 2017, its roots lie much deeper.",3
"Successive rounds of legislation and policy effectively set traps for the Windrush generation…Over decades, legislation progressively eroded the rights of the Windrush generation… The hostile environment was another step on the long road towards a more restrictive immigration regime, but it was also a departure in terms of the scale and seriousness of the effects which would be directly felt by individuals The department”— by which she means the Home Office— “developed immigration policy at speed, impelled by ministerial pressure, with too little consideration of the possible impact of the measures” That is reflected in the evidence monitoring the impact of the right to rent scheme, one of the key measures of the hostile environment that the Windrush generation came up against.",3
"The evidence monitoring that scheme shows that it discriminates on nationality and racial grounds Many of the hostile environment policies operate by outsourcing immigration enforcement to people in the community such as health workers, bank workers and employers.",3

"He never though that he would be the kind of person who would be caught up in the Windrush scandal, but he was and he was extremely upset and had a genuine fear that he was going to be deported, until my office was able to sort out his status and paperwork Another constituent of mine, a British national from the Commonwealth who came here before 1988, has been unable to get work as a professional bus driver for the past few years because he was wrongly accused of hijacking someone else’s identity.",3

"The scale and depth of this injustice is huge: deportations, innocent people being detained, all under a Government who have moved so far to the right that the centre ground is barely visible, let alone the ability to see people as humans and fellow brothers and sisters I welcomed the Home Office’s apology, but an injustice on this scale needs to be followed with action.",3

"Therefore, as the SNP’s immigration spokesperson I will say again that what happened to those people who came here as part of the Windrush generation was utterly wrong.",3
"There is a growing narrative from this Government about two types of immigrants: the good, compliant ones and the illegal ones, who are, it follows, according to this Government, bad, and bad for the UK That fits with the wider narrative that there is no such thing as white privilege when there absolutely is, that there is no institutional racism on these islands when there is, and that the British empire was a force for good in the world.",3
"However, I want to list a few other things that the hostile anti-immigrant narrative is allowing to happen right now.",2
"It is allowing people to be held in communal accommodation completely inappropriate to their needs, such as army barracks, hotels and hostels, and in Glasgow the dreadful so-called mother and baby unit where babies and toddlers have no space—and I mean no space—to do anything other than sleep and eat The narrative allows highly skilled migrants—another group of people we asked to come here because we needed their skills—to be thrown out of the UK on the most spurious of reasons.",3
That is why the Home Affairs Committee recommended it and why the SNP tabled an amendment to the Windrush Compensation Scheme (Expenditure) Bill to that effect The recent news that the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants is teaming up with seven companies to give free legal advice was so welcome and such a relief.,3
"The solution is obvious, but my fear is that, for all the reasons I mentioned, the Government are not looking for solutions because their political ideology wants to make these islands as inaccessible and unwelcoming as possible to those they consider foreign, whether they are or not.",3
"While it is right that we discuss it on the 75th anniversary of the deportations, I know this is not the first time it has been raised on the Floor of the House.",3
I am also pleased that our current immigration rules and equalities legislation would preclude this type of behaviour from occurring now.,3
"I am proud that so many Chinese nationals have now made Britain their choice of destination for study, with 1 million student visas issued since 2010; their choice of destination to work, with over 55,000 work visas issued since 2010; and, ultimately, their choice of home, with over 60,000 grants of settlement and over 45,000 grants of citizenship.",3
"Our British nationals overseas group reflects the UK’s historical moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong who chose to retain ties to the UK by taking up this status at the point of Hong Kong’s handover to China in 1997 Turning to the background, back in 1946 there were some 15,000 to 20,000 Chinese seamen based in the city of Liverpool.",3
"v. Belgium and Greece was a turning point, with an Afghan asylum seeker able successfully to overturn being returned from Belgium to Greece, through which he had transited, on the basis of the poor living conditions he would face should he be returned there.",3
"To say that Greece is an unacceptable place to which to be returned goes so far beyond what the convention authors would have imagined as inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as to be almost unbelievable, but it has established a principle and opened the doors still wider for those seeking to overturn deportation orders across the continent, including in this country The upshot of such decisions is that we have a human rights settlement that often seems to protect perpetrators far more effectively than victims and that repeatedly allows serious offenders to cite their rights to escape the consequences of their actions.",3
"Last December, the Henry Jackson Society published an excellent report by Dr Rakib Ehsan looking at the issue from the perspective of foreign national terrorist offenders.",3
"It identified 45 convicted Islamist terrorists whom we have been unable to deport on human rights grounds since 1998, largely driven by article 3 and article 8, the latter being the right to a family life.",3
"Our inability to deport in the way we would like leaves us unable to rid ourselves of people who are a genuine threat to our society, and I have a number of questions for my hon.",2
"Friend the Minister that I hope he can address in his reply The first question is whether the Minister has considered extending the principle of deportation with assurances to all cases involving foreign national offenders, as opposed to simply those concerning individuals suspected of terrorism.",3
"If we can secure appropriate guarantees from other Governments that they will not mistreat criminals we deport back to them, that ought to suffice Secondly, as part of the fair borders legislation being delivered by my right hon.",3
"As I have set out, the steady extension through case law of what those definitions can encompass is clearly interfering with the deportation of foreign national offenders, particularly on the grounds of article 3 of the ECHR, which is of great relevance to a number of cases Thirdly, what wider work is ongoing within Government to assess how we can reform our human rights settlement, so as to ensure that we have effective deportation options at our disposal, and that our citizens are protected properly from those who ought to be removed under the provisions of the UK Borders Act?",3
"He is surely right that such major changes to our Immigration Rules, whether for immigrants or asylum seekers, require proper and constructive debate that is not carried out in an hour and a half in the late afternoon, without our ability to come to terms with the real issues involved From my experience of both Houses, the Immigration Rules have always been difficult for Parliament to deal with, but we have never had such a problem as the noble Lord described.",3
"These proposals should never be put forward in a way that such major changes have to be taken, as it were, in one gulp We await the sovereign borders Bill, but it is not totally clear which of the Government’s proposals will be only in the rules, in the Bill or in both.",3
"There can be no doubt that people smugglers are vile, and that catching them and preventing them from doing what they do—risking people’s lives—is very important.",2
"This is now a well-worn argument, but if we close legal routes to safety for people seeking asylum, the only recourse they have is to go to the traffickers.",3
"After all, they reached the Greek islands and northern France before they knew of the Government’s proposals—although I doubt that that would have had any effect The Government are saying clearly—and regrettably —that an asylum seeker will be inadmissible if they have travelled through or have a connection with a safe third country.",3
"We cannot allow the accident of geography to put such enormous responsibilities on some countries without the costs being shared Furthermore, I would argue that it is against the 1951 convention to penalise refugees for unauthorised entry to a territory.",3
"Since net immigration accounts for about two-thirds of population growth, immigration policy is especially important.",2
"That is one reason why I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Green, has put down his regret Motion today, and I support him in doing so The UK has always had a substantial amount of immigration, and many people who originated overseas, or whose parents did, have made brilliant contributions to this country in many different fields—business, academia and, most recently, healthcare.",3
"Until 20 years ago, all this was accomplished with a net immigration level of no more than 50,000 a year which, although there were a few incidents, was largely accepted.",3
"The change came when the Blair Labour Government introduced, without consultation, a whole raft of measures to increase immigration, as a result of which the net annual rate soared from less than 50,000 to over 300,000 a year.",3
"This is not just immigration; it is mass immigration The difficulty has been that the new immigrants went into poorer, working-class areas, because that is where housing was affordable.",2
"The local people appealed to the Labour leadership for help, but it did not listen—which is one reason why the Labour Party has lost so much working-class support That is a problem for Labour, but it became a problem for the whole country when immigration became such a big issue in the European Union referendum.",3
"There was a direct line between the neglect of immigration issues by the liberal elite and the vote to leave the European Union, which has had such momentous consequences for our country and is so deplored by that same liberal elite.",3
"First, the issue of immigration is looked at almost exclusively from an economic perspective at the moment.",2
"As my noble friend Lord Hodgson said, we need a democratic authority staffed by demographers, social scientists, environmentalists and climate change experts as well as economists, and they should be asking, “What is the right number of people for these crowded islands?” Secondly, we should wind down as soon as feasible the separate health and care visa.",3
Why have the NHS and medical colleges so totally failed in their manpower planning that more than 40% of doctors in the UK come from overseas?,2
"In Germany and France, it is less than 10% Finally, a cap should be set on the number of work visas issued, just as it is in other countries such as Australia and Canada that use the same points-based system as we do.",3
"We need that cap, because we need employers to concentrate not on the lazy option of recruiting overseas but on improving the skills of the settled population.",3
"Just at the point where we are making real progress in the number and quality of apprenticeships and the funding of further education, it would be foolish to take the pressure off employers in this area Of course, I accept that the current immigration situation is rather unreal as a result of Covid, but the Home Secretary has promised a review next year of how the new system is settling in.",3
"As the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, just indicated, the UK is a nation of immigrants.",4
"About 9% of the UK population, or 6.2 million people, are immigrants—and if anyone perhaps is on a crackly remote line and cannot hear my accent, to be clear I declare that, yes, I am one of them.",3
"We are a nation of emigrants as well as immigrants Listening to the noble Lords, Lord Green, Lord Horam and Lord Hodgson, I found myself feeling that I was trapped in another age.",3
"The invaluable Refugee Action briefing for this debate noted that with the current backlog of asylum claims, 76% of people are waiting for more than six months.",3
"She had been in the UK for a decade, waiting to get status in an uncertain immigration situation.",3
"If asylum claims are treated as inadmissible on the basis of the method of arrival, people are going to be left in indefinite limbo.",3
"Then there is case-by-case negotiation, using many resources The Government say they want to tackle people trafficking and are concerned about this situation.",3
"That is the practical reality My very brief final point is that, as the Freedom from Torture briefing points out, HC 1043 is in contravention of Article 31 of the refugee convention.",3
"So, I was almost an immigrant, and my father most certainly was My first point goes back to that made by the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, and others: what is Parliament for when we are debating things that are so far past?",3
"We are being treated not as legislators but as rubber stamps, and that is not acceptable In my long career in politics I have never known debates on immigration to be either clear or popular.",3
"They are not clear because people get confused between asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and legal migrants, and they are seldom without emotion because people project their fears on to others, and the others are often those migrant communities.",3
"Any approach to immigration needs to be accompanied by an expansion of training places for those skilled migrants that we are pulling in, particularly from the third world I turn to the 2016 vote and what came out of it.",3
"It could well, but we need a debate about it We also need a debate about illegal migrants and asylum seekers and the difference between the two.",3
"As the Minister will know, I have asked on numerous occasions how come we cannot stop boats crossing the Channel.",3
How come it is apparently not an offence to illegally enter the country?,2
That is something we need to tighten up on because there is a world of difference between people-smuggling and immigrants and migrants coming into the country and leaving.,2
"On balance, I tend to be closer to the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, than to the noble Lord, Lord Green: the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, has outlined the advance and contribution made by migrant communities, and it is enormous The biggest attraction of the United Kingdom is the English language.",3
"We should not sacrifice freedom, decency or our lack of corruption, so we have to make a policy and a framework that will work within that, and that will encourage genuine migrants but crack down on the illegal businesses that are flourishing.",2
"What do the Government say to that and what will they do differently going forward The Minister knows of our disappointment that the health and care visa did not cover significant numbers of care workers, who, alongside other key workers, kept this country going through the pandemic—though I note that “senior care worker” has now been added to the shortage occupation list.",3
"Can the Minister give an update on routes for younger people in Hong Kong born after 1997—for example, ensuring that the existing youth mobility scheme can offer a clear path to citizenship I turn to the EU settlement scheme.",3
Could the Minister therefore give an update on efforts to identify and support looked-after children Buried—this is why more debate is important—in the first instrument are the really concerning powers to deport a person solely on the grounds of being homeless.,3
Have the Government used this power during the pandemic The Statement published on 10 December lays some groundwork for government plans on asylum.,3
"The Government’s two-tiered plans for asylum take their eye off people smugglers and instead seek to penalise the refugees exploited by them On enforcement, how many—if any—of the international agreements needed for this policy are now in place?",3
How many people smugglers have been successfully prosecuted since 2019?,3
How many refugees will be welcomed under the new UK resettlement scheme?,3
"This House is very good at scrutinising all aspects of government policy, and I fully expect that, when we come to the sovereign borders debate, we will spend days on end discussing this issue I welcome the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, to his place on the Front Bench.",3
Our new plan for immigration is driven by three objectives.,3
The first is to increase the fairness of our system so that we can protect and support those in genuine need of asylum.,3
"The second is to deter illegal entry into the UK, breaking the awful business model of people smugglers—I do not think that any noble Lords have in any way tried to lessen the severity of what they do—and protecting those people whose lives are in danger.",3
"People coming to the UK through resettlement routes will be granted indefinite leave to remain, and they will receive more support to learn English, find work and integrate.",3
"We will also amend British nationality law so that members of the Windrush generation, as mentioned by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark and others, will be able to obtain British citizenship more easily The plan marks a step change in our approach as we toughen our stance to deter illegal entry and the criminals that endanger life by enabling it.",3
"For the first time, whether people enter the UK legally or illegally will have an impact on how their asylum claim progresses —I know some noble Lords are not happy about that, but it is to deter criminality—and on their status in the UK, if that claim is successful.",3
"We will deem their claim inadmissible and make every effort to remove those who enter the UK illegally, having travelled through a safe country first in which they could and should have claimed asylum.",3
"I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, that this will be a good thing for people smugglers.",3
"I confirm that immigration status is not a bar to vaccination I will go back to the first point made by the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, which was also talked about by the noble Lords, Lord Coaker and Lord Paddick, about the complexity of these rules making parliamentary scrutiny very difficult.",3
The October rules made essential changes which delivered on the Government’s people’s priorities commitment to introduce a new global immigration system.,3
It includes consolidating immigration legislation in line with the Law Commission’s recommendation.,3
"It is not a process that can be completed overnight, but we are determined to make progress so that the system is easier to navigate and understand for all users In response to the specific points in the 33rd report of the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee, which criticised the length of the rules change, it should be remembered that the introduction of the new points-based system at the end of free movement was an extremely significant milestone in this country’s approach to immigration.",3
"While the Immigration Rules are the technical underpinning of the immigration system, there is no expectation that applicants would need to understand them in minute detail, because they can find that clear and straightforward information on GOV.UK The noble Lords, Lord Dubs and Lord Paddick, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark talked about the new rules on inadmissibility.",3
Those who fear persecution should claim asylum in the first safe country that they reach.,4
"Inadmissibility is a long-standing process designed to prevent secondary movement across Europe, and these measures have been introduced to support this principle now that the UK is no longer bound by the Dublin regulation In answer to my noble friend Lord Balfe’s point on accepting claims made by those who enter the UK on small boats, it has to be said that too many people risk their lives to get to the UK using unseaworthy vessels, putting not only their lives but those of our Border Force and the people who rescue them at risk.",3
We are determined to send a clear signal that it is completely unacceptable for individuals to travel through multiple safe countries to claim asylum in the UK.,3
The inadmissibility provisions in the Immigration Rules give us the legal basis to declare an asylum claim as inadmissible where a person has a connection to or has passed through a safe country.,3
"As I have said, we are very determined to send that clear signal that people should not travel through multiple safe countries to claim asylum in the UK.",3
"Unlike Dublin, the new returns agreements we seek will return an individual to any safe country—I know that the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, said he objects to that—that they have a connection to or has been present in and could have claimed asylum in, making it much more straightforward.",3
"This includes new arrangements for the family reunion of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children On our international commitments, which the noble Baroness, Lady Bennett of Manor Castle, the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark asked about, we are very clear that the new rules comply with our international obligations under the refugee convention.",3
"If we cannot return an inadmissible claimant to a safe country within a reasonable period of time, we will consider their claim in the UK On the cap and the salary threshold that my noble friend Lord Horam and the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, asked about, the MAC advised that the cap be abolished, as “it creates uncertainty among employers and it makes little sense for a migrant to be perceived as of value one day and not the next which is what inevitably happens when the cap binds.” The MAC has said—I think I said this the other day— that if the Government want to reduce migration numbers it would make more economic sense to do so by varying the other aspects of the scheme criteria, such as salary thresholds and the level of the immigration surcharge.",3
"On the issue of numbers overall, the Government have been quite clear for a number of years now that it is not about numbers but about a fair system and people not taking illegal journeys to this country when it is dangerous to do so The noble Lords, Lord Balfe and Lord Coaker, talked about BNOs.",3
"The MAC recommends changes to the SOL where there are skilled jobs with an identified national shortage that it would be sensible to fill, at least in part, through immigration—these are set out in the shortage occupation list.",3
Changes to the immigration rules in March of this year give workers in key health and care roles greater opportunity to come to the UK.,3
"I think it is fair that people who have the sufficient skills and salary to come to this country should be given the opportunity, across the piece, to do so The Government promised to take a common-sense approach to controlling immigration, both legal and illegal, and we will deliver on that promise.",3
"We owe them a huge amount of respect for sticking around and informing the debate, even if our politics often differ from theirs and we do not agree with absolutely everything they say The Bill is hostile towards refugees, flies in the face of the refugee convention, and goes against the advice of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, non-governmental organisations and human rights lawyers.",3
"From human trafficking victims to those undertaking involuntary labour and those in forced marriage, modern slavery impacts countless lives, and it is a sad but inescapable reality that it happens in many of our constituencies.",2
"I pay tribute to Restore Glasgow in my constituency and the great work that it does to raise awareness of human trafficking, particularly teaching people to spot the signs of trafficking.",3
"Many of us wrongly assume that human trafficking and slavery occurs behind closed doors, but in some cases—indeed, far too many—it is hiding in plain sight on our high streets and in our shop fronts.",2
"Bluntly, if four or five guys in flip-flops are washing your car for a few quid, then the alarm bells should be ringing loud and clear There should be greater regulation in these industries to help prevent cases of human trafficking and slavery occurring in the first place, and that is where I would challenge governments both local and national, and all across these islands, to go further.",3
"Figures released in 2020 highlight that any efforts to crack down on slavery have been weak and slow, with only 42 convictions on slavery and human trafficking in 2018, down from 59 in 2017 and 69 in 2016 I have outlined aspects of modern slavery that I feel need to be further addressed, and I hope that the Minister will address some of those points in the wind-ups.",3
We so often hear from Conservative Members about their views on immigration and asylum.,3
"That is because, as MPs who rightly welcome people to our city and take up asylum casework, we far too often see the significant failings of an asylum and immigration system that is utterly broken, making it so difficult for those we represent This Bill and much of what it represents is not what Scotland wants or voted for.",3
Scotland is a welcoming country to refugees and asylum seekers.,4
"Earlier this year, my home city united and sent a clear message to the Home Office with the Kenmure Street protest, proving that once again all people, including refugees and asylum seekers, make Glasgow.",3
"Glasgow rejects this Bill and looks forward to a day when Westminster’s right-wing immigration policies and dangerous anti-refugee rhetoric has no territorial application on our citizens, and instead we can form borders and nationality policy that is based on dignity, not on dog-whistle politics.",3
"We are establishing a fast-track appeal process and streamlining the appeal system, making it quicker to remove failed asylum seekers and dangerous foreign criminals, the very people they would like to keep in this country.",3
"They want open borders, and they would encourage more people smuggling and more dangerous crossings that would compromise our national interest and our public safety.",2
"Our opponents have no answers to this Bill, and we are the ones who want to control illegal migration.",3
We want to take back control of our borders.,3
Many Opposition Members have written letters opposing the deportation of murderers and rapists.,3
"Two years ago, the Home Secretary promised she had a plan to halve within three months the number of boats crossing the channel.",3
"Instead, the number has gone up tenfold since then, as criminal gangs have switched to using flimsy boats instead.",3
She said she was confident that her plan would lead to a considerable reduction in illegal activity.,3
"Instead, those smugglers and traffickers are making more and more profit as lives are being lost Far from cracking down on the criminal gangs and the smugglers, this Bill makes things worse.",3
We need solutions and co-operation to try to tackle the smuggler gangs who are making a profit from people losing their lives.,2
The Afghan soldier who worked with our armed forces and arrived by boat with his family just a few weeks ago to claim asylum should never have ended up in a dinghy on the channel.,3
"I praise Glasgow’s role as a dispersal city, and the great work of organisations such as the Govan Community Project and the Govan Home and Education Link Project, which help asylum seekers on a daily basis Glasgow is well aware of the reality of asylum seekers’ experiences, which we cannot really contemplate.",3
"Victims of torture, sexual violence and persecution—that is the reality of asylum seekers’ experience.",2
"I am afraid that this Bill exposes the Conservative party in all its guises, because it is the politics of the dog whistle—the politics where every person seeking sanctuary is viewed with suspicion I read Hansard today and the phrase “economic migrants” was used liberally by Conservative Back Benchers yesterday.",3
"Perhaps they could benefit from Show Racism the Red Card coming in here, as they do in classrooms in Glasgow, and explaining the difference between an asylum seeker, a refugee and an economic migrant, because I suspect that some Conservative Back Benchers would fail that simple test.",3
"For example, Serco obtained an extraordinary High Court ruling that private sector companies, which the Government use across public services, do not have to comply with basic human rights legislation when providing accommodation to asylum seekers It is surprising to hear Government Members say that the legal routes issue is different from those in the Bill.",3
"The Bill was, of course, published before any formal response to the consultation—a consultation in which many organisations that deal and work with asylum seekers on a daily basis raised real concerns that have not been addressed Depriving asylum seekers of the chance to obtain competent legal representation and to challenge poor decisions increases the risk of returning people to extremely serious danger.",3
That approach also ignores the numerous reasons why refugees may be unable to provide all the evidence and information regarding their case at an early stage in the procedure.,3
Asylum seekers do not have expertise in the UK’s immigration system when they get here fleeing oppression.,2
It is astonishing that Home Office providers of asylum accommodation do not need to use registered social landlords to provide that accommodation.,3
"It really is astonishing The independent chief inspector of borders and immigration described the Home Office’s use of that sort of accommodation as a “serious error of judgment”, while the immigration court ruled earlier that the Home Secretary failed to ensure that deaths in immigration detention centres were properly investigated.",3
"Centres in Australia saw cases of sexual abuse and the rape of refugees leading to some falling pregnant, and there were instances of staff using unreasonable force, while the remoteness of offshore facilities also caused deaths due to the lack of healthcare facilities Glasgow has risen up to the Home Office time and again, as we did in Kenmure Street, and I was very proud to be there exercising my right to freedom of peaceful assembly.",3
"The people of Glasgow in opposing the Bill say this: “Say it loud, say it clear: refugees are welcome here”.",3
The Nationality and Borders Bill is important and necessary legislation to address the growing problem of illegal entry into the UK by migrants crossing the Dover straits.,3
"For residents on the Kent coast, including in my constituency, it has become a fact of life that, when the weather is good and the sea is calm, hundreds of undocumented asylum seekers will attempt to cross the channel in small boats We need to be clear that illegal crossings of the channel are dangerous and cost lives.",3
"In recent years, migrants have died while being smuggled in lorries.",3
"There have been deaths from people trying to walk through the channel tunnel, and there have been drownings at sea from people trying to make it across the channel in small boats.",3
"No country would allow this to continue, or should The Government have made substantial investments, along with the French authorities, to improve security at the port of Calais and the channel tunnel, making it much harder for people to gain illegal entry there.",3
"Vessels need to be intercepted before they get into the water, as interception at sea is dangerous if the migrants on the vessels are not co-operating with the authorities.",3
"I would say, though, that excellent work has been done at sea when it has been needed by Border Force and most importantly—I would like to thank this group of people—by the volunteer lifeboat men working for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution at the lifeboat stations from Dungeness in my constituency round to Dover, who are now regularly called out to assist people in distress at sea Pascale Moreau, the European director of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said a couple of years ago of this problem: “Our collective response should be comprehensive and complementary—from saving lives to combating smuggling rings, expanding legal options, and ensuring that all those who are in need of protection can effectively access it” That is why the approach set out in this Bill is so important We need to make it clear that illegal entry to the UK is not a shortcut to residency in this country.",3
We need to make it clear to the people traffickers who prey on vulnerable people for profit that they will face tough sentences for bringing people illegally into this country.,3
"It will make it illegal for people to arrive in UK waters without permission, which it already is; increase the maximum sentences for people who are arriving in the country illegally from six months to four years; make it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission; and introduce tough new sentences for people traffickers, so they know they will face lengthy prison sentences—up to life prison sentences—if they are involved in operating people trafficking rings.",3
These are the reforms we need Alongside these reforms must also go the work for safe routes to make sure that migrants and asylum seekers are aware of safe legal routes to enter this country.,3
"The safe routes scheme this country invested in saw more than 25,000 refugees settled in this country from 2015 to 2020.",3
"Under the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme, working with UNHCR, we were able to identify the most vulnerable people in the most dangerous places and give them a safe route to enter this country We want people to take that route, not to put their lives in the hands of people-trafficking gangs to make a journey across Europe and a life-threatening journey across the channel, but instead to work with the authorities in war zones and danger zones, where we know people are displaced and need help, to give them a safe legal route to this country and to know that at the end of that safe legal route will be a successful asylum claim and with it indefinite leave to remain in the UK.",3
"We need to close down the illegal crossing points, which are incredibly dangerous, that are profiting criminal gangs and are rightly concerning to people who live on the Kent coast, too.",2
We need to close this route down and give people safe routes to this country and safe ways to claim asylum.,2
"At the time, he said: “I shall become a naturalised Englishman as soon as is possible for my papers to go through.” He never did get those papers, though Throughout this debate, I have heard Members laud our history of accepting refugees as if it somehow explains and justifies the Bill before us; as if our capacity as a nation to retrospectively see that we did the right thing means that we are doing so now.",3
"Yet even when it came to geniuses like Einstein, the term “asylum seeker” has always meant second-class citizen.",3
"Now we have orphaned children sleeping rough on our border with France and in Greece in overcrowded covid-ridden camps, and we say that they must be safe so they are not our problem Let us stop re-writing the UK’s history to provide cover for legislation like this, which makes plain the Government’s disdain for those who find themselves with little alternative but to run for their lives.",3
"They want to penalise people for how they run, creating a third class of citizens who are at perpetual risk of being deported: because they did not queue properly and fill in the appropriate form, they did not travel directly to an island nation or present themselves immediately for a claim, they must be suspect, regardless of their story or why they fled, breaching the refugee convention.",3
Why should we help them?” The convention is clear that there is no requirement to claim asylum in the first safe country.,3
"It was intended to get nations to work together to help make managing those at risk possible It is true that it was easier to quietly ignore those in danger when there were not that many of them, before the mass refugee camps in Sudan or the Syrian civil war, but just because the challenge is harder does not mean that our response should be, too; that we should be a nation that does not keep its promises to the 3,000 children we said we would take under the Dubs scheme; we have only taken 480.",3
"Turkey is taking 4 million refugees and we are quibbling about 26,000 applications.",3
"The vast majority of refugees end up staying in the areas they have run from, displaced and living in developing countries when wealthy ones like ours want to look the other way Persecution does not happen in an orderly fashion.",2
"If we think that the only place that people are running from is Syria, we do not understand what is going on in Ethiopia, Iran, Afghanistan, to the Uyghurs, to LGBTQ people in Myanmar, or to Christians and religious minorities around the world Ministers claim the legislation will protect women from trafficking when it will do the reverse, because it is not based on any evidence.",3
"Their own statistics show that the majority in detention referred to the national referral mechanism are then recognised as potential victims of trafficking and that 81% of reasonable grounds rejections that are challenged are granted a positive ruling, yet many of those women would fall into that group, too.",3
"Those who have lauded the Australians and their offshoring facility at Nauru would do well to read the horrifying accounts of the sexual abuse of women and children over the years, in addition to the hundreds of incidents of threatened and actual self-harm, and ask whether this is really the path we want to go down Einstein said: “A bundle of belongings isn’t the only thing a refugee brings to his new country.” Out there, the British public know that.",3
This Bill will not stop the boats; it will encourage them.,3
I urge colleagues to vote this Bill down and stand up to those who want to demonise refugees.,3
"However, I will confine my remarks to illegal immigration and allow other Members to get in This debate is particularly poignant today, when we hit a new record high for small boat crossings, with 430 people crossing in a single day.",3
"While Redcar and Cleveland is more than 300 miles from Dover, I am contacted about illegal immigration almost daily.",3
"I am here to share the views of those I represent, and I believe that we owe it to the public to finally address the problem There are a few in my constituency who want Britain to completely close its borders to asylum seekers and refugees—I believe they are wrong.",3
"Equally, there are some who want us to be borderless and do nothing to prevent illegal immigration into this country, and they are wrong, too.",2
"The vast majority of people in Redcar and Cleveland, including me, want us to help those most in need and offer protection to those facing persecution while preventing illegal entry into this country That is why this Bill is so important.",3
We can have a firm but fair approach to illegal immigration.,3
"“Fair” means new, safe legal routes to asylum in the UK.",3
“Fair” means improving support for genuine refugees to help them to build their lives here We have to be honest with our constituents about what is happening in the small boats on the channel and in lorries through the tunnel.,3
"People are being smuggled into this country, and those who evade detection are vulnerable to modern-day slavery and further trafficking within the UK.",2
"As the Home Secretary said yesterday, in 2020, 8,500 people arrived by boat.",3
"Many have paid hundreds of pounds for the journey, and in some cases thousands, although it has dropped in recent months, to jump the asylum queue and deny a legitimate asylum seeker a space I use the word “legitimate” because these people are crossing the channel.",3
"They could have claimed asylum in France, Italy, Spain or Germany, or any other safe country they have travelled through.",4
We should be proud of our record on overseas aid contributions and to have resettled more refugees than any other European nation.,3
This is a matter not of us turning our back on the world but of making sure that our immigration system is firm but fair in the way that the British people would demand I come back to the point that I have made over and over again in this place: the most compassionate thing we can do to help these people is to make the route unviable and prevent the crossings altogether.,3
I will outline why doing nothing is not an option Stoke-on-Trent has stepped up to take more than its fair share of asylum seekers under the asylum dispersal system.,3
"Many who have taken part in this debate represent areas that do not currently participate in the scheme, and I would respectfully suggest that their calls for fairness, and the unwillingness to condemn or curb illegal and dangerous routes into this country, should be matched by a clear commitment to take their fair share of the ever-increasing numbers of asylum seekers who land on our shores According to recent figures, the Home Office had voluntary arrangements with 95 local authorities throughout the UK on accepting the dispersal of asylum seekers.",3
"As part of the regional dispersal policy established in 2000, an advisory cluster limit was set by the Home Office of one asylum seeker for every 200 of the settled population.",3
"Crucially, there are neighbourhoods where the concentration of asylum seekers raises the risk of increased social tension, as well as challenging the capacity of local health, education and other support services.",3
"It is right that we put into domestic law international obligations for a recovery period, during which victims of modern slavery receive support, and establish a law, on the basis of which confirmed victims are eligible for temporary leave to remain I do, however, receive significant correspondence from local residents, calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration.",3
They want us to crack down on the criminal trafficking networks that exploit the desperation of the most vulnerable.,2
They want us to ensure that the UK is not a safe haven for foreign criminals.,3
"Over the past six years, the UK has directly resettled 25,000 people—more than any other country in Europe—from places of danger, and refugee family reunion has seen 29,000 people come to the UK over the same period, so we will take no lectures on our credentials as a compassionate Government Stoke-on-Trent City Council has worked closely with the Home Office, and we welcome the Department’s commitment to bring 560 jobs to our city.",3
It has demonstrated a commitment to levelling up and a recognition that Stoke-on-Trent is the ideal location for the new immigration caseworking innovation centre The Bill is important legislation with the principle of fairness at its heart.,3
"It was encouraging to hear not only about his and Lord McColl’s continued commitment to provisions of previous legislation, but about his engagement with the Home Secretary and her commitment to leave open the opportunity to thoughtfully and productively consider changes to the Bill In considering part 4, I think not only of the reduction of the practical support to confirmed victims of modern slavery and human trafficking from 45 days—it will remain at 45 days in Northern Ireland and Scotland—but of the disparity between what is available in those 45 days and what will be available in the 30 days that clause 52 proposes.",3
"It is wrong, it is cruel and it serves no place that somebody can be detained on immigration grounds with no indication of how long they will be detained or how they will be released from detention.",3
"I hope that the Bill will give us a fresh opportunity to consider that fully and bring some finality On refugees, I think it fair to say that we have a proud record as a country, although we should not rest on our laurels.",3
"The figures have been cited throughout our debate: 25,000 refugees have come to the United Kingdom since 2015, and a further 29,000 family members have been resettled in this country.",3
"It raises the anomaly that, by virtue of the Belfast agreement and the Irish Government’s approach to these issues, someone born in Northern Ireland can attain Irish citizenship by simply filling in the form and paying a fee of £70, whereas someone born in the Republic of Ireland who had spent the entirety of their life living in the United Kingdom, in Northern Ireland, cannot do the same; they have to go through exactly the same citizenship process, pay £1,330 and prove their proficiency in English.",3
"That applies not only to hundreds of people who live in the north-west and around the border areas of Northern Ireland, but to a former Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly and a Member of our House of Lords.",3
"He is entitled to vote upon and contribute in the parliamentary affairs of our country, but he is not entitled to citizenship unless he pays £1,330 and proves his proficiency in English—that is nonsense.",4
"I rise to support this Bill, which contains some sensible measures, particularly on regularising the citizenship of certain mothers, fathers and members of the military, and prioritising the rapid removal of foreign criminals, who really should not be in this country.",3
"But something desperately needs to be done, because our asylum and immigration system is broken.",2
"As the Windrush scandal showed, there are so many different criteria for being able to claim citizenship or right to residency in the UK.",3
"Thirdly, for genuine refugees, especially children in potentially dangerous situations, the process takes far too long.",2
There is a lack of urgency from immigration officials on the ground in the country of application or from the Home Office here.,3
"The queue is far too long and is taking too long to shift Fourthly, despite its shortcomings, the process is now being routinely bypassed by those who come across the channel illegally, usually because they can afford to pay people traffickers.",3
"Effectively, these people are queue jumping, taking up spaces that we are quite rightly prepared to offer to vulnerable families in refugee camps coming from those places of danger who have gone through the right procedures—genuinely vulnerable families whose lives are in peril Frankly, this is happening because the French Government have consistently failed to close off this route.",3
They could prevent more of those boats getting into the water in the first place; goodness knows we have given them enough resources and security co-operation.,3
"First, I have had a query from the Shoreham lifeboat crew about potential liabilities on lifeboats rescuing some of these migrants trying to get into the UK illegally, and whether they are at risk under the terms of the Bill.",3
"If they fail to pay, their status becomes illegal, and if they then want to start again, they have to start all over again.",3
"This pandemic has shown us that the Government must respond quickly and correctly to emerging crises, and that our border controls must be in place to prevent the flow of covid and to ensure that our citizens are protected both here and abroad I also welcome clauses 5 and 6, which strengthen the pathways to citizenship.",3
"As one who went through the immigration system, I can attest to how expensive it is and how convoluted it was previously.",2
"I welcome the Home Secretary’s work to create a level of expediency and transparency for those who have rightly come here to work, and to enter into legal citizenship because they want to contribute and be part of British society.",3
"I have known many people, not only constituents but friends of mine, who had to return to New Zealand, Australia or South Africa because, although they had a right to be here because they were ethnically British and were merely attempting, for instance, some kind of reunion, the Home Office’s administrative hurdles on the path to citizenship were so challenging and difficult that many gave up and went back to their homes.",3
"I just hope that these welcome reforms will allow those who genuinely want to be British and have every right to be here to access that citizenship, as I did I pay tribute to the UK’s history of refugee resettlement, and to our scheme which will continue to ensure the safety of incoming refugees.",3
I am proud that between 2016 and 2019 the UK resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any European Union member state—and that includes the vital resettlement of vulnerable children and the issuing of family reunion visas to bring families back together One of the key provisions in the Bill is the introduction of new and tougher definitions of criminal offences to deter people from attempting to enter the UK illegally.,3
"It raises the penalty for illegal entry from six months to four years in prison, and introduces life sentences for people smugglers.",3
"Not only is that illegal and inhumane, but it keeps dangerous pathways open, which can lead to the abuse and loss of life of refugees trying to reach the UK.",2
"For the safety and sustainability of our country, and the safety and wellbeing of refugees seeking to enter the UK, it is vital that the UK has a clear and effective plan to deter and prevent illegal entry into our country.",3
"I welcome the fact that, through this Bill, we seek to crack down on illegal immigration so that we can prioritise those in genuine need.",3
"I will miss out on my mum’s famous biryani, but speaking in today’s debate is much more important By naming this piece of legislation the Nationality and Borders Bill, this Tory Government are attempting to legitimise a frankly abhorrent way in which to treat those who are escaping extreme violence, so let us just call this Bill what it is: the anti-refugee Bill.",3
Refugees need compassion and not to be accused of being economic migrants.,2
"From the cuts to aid budgets to this two-tiered refugee system, this Tory Government are pushing their “us versus them” narrative.",3
I have spoken previously in this very Chamber about the manner in which this Tory Government view immigration and foreigners coming into this country.,3
"Just because someone was not born here or does not have a British passport does not mean that they will not make a valuable contribution, whether socially, economically or politically Dr Waheed Arain is just one example.",4
"He released an open letter, in which he said: “I spent my childhood hiding from rockets in refugee camps in Afghanistan.",3
"I would have been classed as an ‘illegal arrival’, denied access to the asylum system, prosecuted for breaking the law, and…removed from the country.” My message to Waheed today is: sorry.",3
"It will come as no surprise that I do not agree with a great number of things that she said, but she may get some comfort from one of the proposals that I will make later to improve the Bill I welcome any Bill that aims to address historical anomalies and areas of unfairness in British nationality law, and to make the current system of applying for asylum fairer and more efficient.",3
"This Bill will ensure that those who are in genuine need can be supported, and, at the same time, deter illegal entry into the UK.",3
"This is a timely and important topic and an area of law that we have needed to address for some time In recent years, we have sadly been haunted by terrible scenes and tragic reports of migrants losing their lives while attempting to enter the UK.",3
"The Bill aims to save and protect lives by ensuring that only safe and legal routes into the UK remain, and proposes harsher punishments for human smugglers and traffickers, who are responsible for so much suffering.",3
"The introduction of life sentences for human smuggling, by way of which so many lives have been endangered, will attempt to combat and condemn the exploitation of migrants.",3
"Tougher criminal sentences for those attempting to enter the UK illegally will also steer those seeking asylum towards safe and legal routes, and ultimately protect their lives.",3
"The short answer is that this Bill does an awful lot to end human trafficking and the nasty, awful environment that is being fostered by the criminal gangs who are putting lives at risk.",3
"Gentleman says and the expertise that he brings to the debate, but I do not necessarily see it in the same way as he does The UK has a proud history of supporting the most vulnerable people worldwide, having resettled more refugees than any other country in Europe.",4
Attention needs to be given to the costly and arduous routes to citizenship that are bureaucratic and expensive for those who are already settled and working in the UK.,2
"I declare an interest, as my partner is an overseas NHS worker.",3
"Often these individuals have travelled great distances and put their own lives at risk to help and save our lives, regardless of their or our citizenship; their duty to care and contribute to the wellbeing of their patients is what comes first and I commend their hard work However, with fees for indefinite leave to remain at almost £2,400 and citizenship applications another £1,330, the process of becoming a citizen for many of our NHS workers is a costly and challenging one.",3
"Member for Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine) said last week during an intervention in the Health and Care Bill debate, if we offered indefinite leave to remain to all of our NHS workers who are here on renewable visas, I feel confident that the gap in the NHS workforce would almost certainly close and, simultaneously, we would be recognising their hard work and sacrifices.",3
"Should we not therefore consider changing our current citizenship process to one that does not deter NHS workers through high costs and time-consuming processes, one that does not leave them in debt and in poverty but instead rewards their commitment to their communities I welcome the many steps that the Bill takes to improve the UK’s asylum and immigration system to make it one that is based on needs, and I welcome the new NHS visa that has been announced by the Home Office.",3
"Given that the Government themselves have already recognised the importance of creating a bespoke route for incoming NHS workers, I feel it is also our duty to focus on those who have already given so much to our country, by creating a new route to citizenship for existing NHS workers One of the objections to this could be that once indefinite leave to remain or citizenship had been conferred, the NHS worker would be free to go to the private sector or to a different role altogether, having benefited from the fee abolition.",3
"There does not seem to be any reasonable reason why a similar scheme could not be put in place to make this workable As I have said before, in this place and in Westminster Hall, it is time to abolish the fees for indefinite leave to remain and for citizenship for those who work in our NHS, so that those who spend time helping and treating us can finally feel like they belong and are welcomed in our country with open arms.",3
"Today we heard the good news that Kenneth Macharia, a mechanical engineer who plays for the Bristol Bisons rugby team, has won his asylum appeal after a five-year battle with the Home Office, and I want to pay tribute to his solicitors at South West Law.",3
"Some have long-standing connections with this country, particularly those from the former British colony of Somaliland who have served in the British Army and worked in the docks, but many others arrived here as refugees, fleeing one of the most dangerous places on earth in search of a safe place to live In my years as an MP, I have met so many people, including children, who have been through horrendous experiences, leaving them with not just physical but deep mental scars.",3
"They should be given a fair chance to tell those stories with proper legal representation Of course we want the people who come here to claim asylum through a safe and legal route, and we need a firm but fair legal process so that we can best support those who need it most, but the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants has told us how the few legal routes that do exist are inadequate and highly restrictive.",3
"A refusal to provide ways for people to legally claim asylum will mean that more people attempt to reach the UK illegally, no matter what the penalties are—and dangerously too.",3
It will do nothing to deter the people smugglers or the human traffickers.,2
The Anti-Slavery Commissioner has warned that measures taken to address a potentially small number of people seeking to abuse the immigration system will have a considerable impact on victims of modern slavery.,3
"There is a grave danger of viewing victims of modern slavery through an immigration lens and ignoring the trauma and exploitation they have suffered as victims This attitude towards people seeking sanctuary in the UK, and to immigration more broadly, is not just morally reprehensible but economically ignorant too.",2
"Right now, we are facing acute labour crises in key economic sectors due to this Government’s ideological and narrow-minded approach to immigration: in hospitality; in agriculture, with fresh food left to rot in our fields; and in transport, with firms warning of a 70,000 to 90,000 shortfall of HGV drivers.",3
"Haulage firms have called for drivers to be added to the shortage occupation list, and/or for temporary visas to be issued to overseas drivers as a temporary solution while we try to train up more HGV drivers and deal with the backlog of HGV tests.",3
"They do not want to accept that, as with my own relatives from Ireland, immigrants can and do make a huge contribution to this country The Home Secretary should stop posturing, stop playing politics with people’s lives, and instead bring forward proposals that would genuinely ensure that we have a firm yes, but also a fair asylum system in this country.",3
"Because this Bill tells people that there are safe and legal ways to get to the United Kingdom, and if they follow those safe and legal ways, then we will provide refuge, but we should not be encouraging people, indirectly, to take those illegal routes that we know cost lives We have tried for years to work with France on this issue.",3
Anyone who says that our asylum system is not broken and does not need fixing must not be seeing the same scenes.,2
They must be oblivious to the thousands of people who have crossed the English channel in dangerous boats this year alone.,3
They support tougher penalties for those who enter the country illegally.,3
The Bill sends a clear message to those in genuine need that we have a safe and legal route into the UK—that people do not need to risk their lives in dangerous small boats.,3
"If people need help we are here, but for those who try to game the system and those who think our immigration rules are there to be got around because, somehow, the rules do not apply to them, the penalties are tough.",2
"A different approach for those who follow the rules and those who do not—I cannot see how anyone can disagree with that, but somehow, they do Some Opposition Members do not seem to have a problem with the last-minute claims lodged to avoid deportation, sometimes in the case of serious criminals.",3
"That would allow us to protect our borders proactively, moving us to a model under which we gave people safe haven while considering their application, then brought them to the shelter of the UK.",3
"If illegal entry is one side, the facilitators are the other.",3
"Through the Bill, we will empower our Border Force officers directly to intervene in those people-smuggling gangs—gangs that try to find new ways to circumvent the measures that we design here in the House to protect our country and protect our citizens Firm but fair rules; secure but compassionate borders; a system that ensures that the people of this country are safe; a system under which we know who is coming to the UK and how they are getting here; and our offer of help and support for those who need them—that is what my constituents want, and that is what the Bill delivers.",3
There are lots of things I could say about the UK Government’s Nationality and Borders Bill and their plans for immigration.,3
"Criminalising those who seek sanctuary and who have survived experiences so disturbing and so distressing that they struggle to describe them is absolutely abhorrent I agree with Members who have said that the asylum system is broken, but the Bill is certainly not how I would go about fixing it.",3
"If the Home Secretary has read the book, it is certainly not meant to be taken as a “how to” guide Seeking asylum is not a crime, but this Tory Government are attempting to make it so.",3
"The all-party parliamentary group on immigration detention, which I chair, has been taking evidence from medical and legal experts, as well as from people who have stayed in the Home Office’s quasi-detention facilities at Napier barracks and Penally camp.",3
"This is already, remember, a very fragile population—people who have been exploited, trafficked, tortured, seen their families killed or raped, or been subject to sexual violence themselves A third of residents at Napier said they felt suicidal—a much higher ideation rate than would be expected among asylum seekers living in the community.",3
"There are issues with the capacity of local immigration lawyers to take on cases and being able to work with a lawyer when there are no private spaces in which to discuss the case, which is a breach of people’s article 8 rights.",3
"Public Health England, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration and Her Majesty’s chief inspector of prisons all raised concerns about the impact of communal living on the spread of covid-19.",3
Will there be a statement in the House on the findings of the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration?,3
"Deny adequate medical and legal support, so that it is harder for asylum seekers to make their case.",2
My constituents and I do not support this anti-refugee Bill.,3
"All refugees are human beings, who deserve safety and dignity like any one of us, and no one is illegal.",4
"The UK does not have a problem with asylum seekers, nor indeed immigration.",4
Some specific examples regarding asylum seekers are being magnified and generalised in order to rationalise bad law.,3
"The UK must acknowledge both its capacity to assist and indeed the requirements of basic humanity, and therefore ensure that its laws are consistent with those realities On a per capita basis, the UK accepts fewer asylum seekers than most other European jurisdictions, and faces less pressure due to its geographically peripheral position in relation to some of the migrant routes.",3
"Asylum seekers and, indeed, immigrants are not overwhelming public services or stealing jobs.",3
"Where pockets of unemployment or under-employment exist, that reflects poor investment in skills and job creation initiatives The current high bar to acceptance of asylum claims is expected to be even higher as a result of the Bill, and those who try to assist run the risk of being criminalised.",3
The notion of offshoring asylum seekers is particularly repugnant.,2
"There is a danger that that could have an impact on thousands of people who live on the island of Ireland and cross the border, sometimes daily Although the Government have said that there will be no immigration controls at the border on the island of Ireland, there could still be a bureaucratic complication for those EU nationals to comply with any requirements around an ETA, and legal uncertainty for those entering Northern Ireland without one.",3
"I would be grateful for clarification on how these particular circumstances will be taken into account The nationality parts of the Bill have received much less attention, and I want to focus on the Government’s failure properly to reflect in domestic law the citizenship and identity aspects of the Good Friday agreement, namely that it is the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they choose, and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland Like many people, I am comfortable with both a British and an Irish identity.",3
The subject of immigration is of great importance to my constituents in Great Grimsby.,3
"Let me say first, Madam Deputy Speaker, that control of immigration does not mean stopping people coming here.",3
My constituents understand that from time to time we need to provide help to genuine refugees fleeing from war zones or from natural disasters.,3
"Equally, we have a tradition of providing asylum to people whose Governments are not as generous or as freedom-loving as our own.",4
"We as a country do that willingly and with generosity What the people of Grimsby do not accept is people travelling through multiple free, safe European countries then attempting illegal entry to the UK and claiming asylum on entry.",4
This is not asylum seeking.,3
He found that Grimsby was a great place to live and so applied for citizenship and became a British citizen.,4
"In the process, he had to give up his Italian citizenship, but he did it willingly because he wanted to participate fully in life in the UK as a British citizen, to work hard, to run a business, to pay his taxes and to raise a family.",4
It is not fair on all those who have followed the proper rules to migrate to this country that illegal immigrants and bogus asylum claimants are treated in the same way I have been struck by the contributions of Labour Members giving all sorts of spurious reasons why they will oppose the Bill.,3
Should nations prevent anyone from crossing their borders?,2
"There would be mass immigration without border control, which would put enormous burdens on infrastructure and public services, inevitably leading to economic instability and unemployment.",2
"These are the reasons why every single country has its own rules about who may travel, work and reside within its borders.",2
"Every country has the right to protect its borders and every country has legal migration routes via visas or work permits Every day, thousands of migrants and refugees leave their countries in search of refuge, safety and better lives.",2
"An economic migrant is different from a refugee, being someone who leaves his or her country of origin for education or for financial or economic reasons.",3
Economic migrants choose to move to find a better life—they do not flee war-torn countries or move because of past persecution—and there are legal routes for economic migrants to come here.,3
"Refugees and migrants are not the same, even though many people, especially Opposition Members, argue that all migrants should be treated as if they were refugees on the basis that they are all seeking a better, more secure life.",3
"The United Kingdom has a proud record of helping those fleeing persecution, oppression or tyranny from around the world, alongside providing around £10 billion a year to support people through our overseas aid.",4
The UK is a global leader in refugee settlement.,4
"Between 2016 and 2019, as a country we resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any member state of the EU.",3
"In total, across all Government-funded resettlement schemes, the UK has resettled more than 25,000 vulnerable refugees in need of protection over the past six years, with around half being children.",3
"More than 29,000 family reunion visas have been issued in the past five years I welcome this Bill because it seeks to retain a compassionate approach and combine it with increased firmness, fairness and efficiency.",3
"I welcome the ambition to see an asylum system based on need, so as to better protect and support those who require our help the most.",3
I welcome the fact that the Government are strengthening the safe and legal routes for refugees and fixing historical anomalies in British nationality law.,3
Continuing to resettle refugees directly from regions of conflict and instability fulfils our manifesto commitment to support those fleeing persecution.,3
Our refugee settlement scheme has protected thousands of people in the past few years I welcome the improved support for refugees provided for in this Bill to help those vulnerable people build their lives in the UK.,3
The enhanced integration package and immediate indefinite leave to remain in the UK for refugees who are resettled through our safe and legal routes will make it more attractive to use legal means of resettlement than illegal ones and help deter perilous crossings It is well known that refugees seeking asylum in the UK are not penalised for entering illegally.,3
I welcome life sentences for people smugglers.,3
"By cracking down on illegal immigration, we can prioritise those in genuine need.",2
"I particularly welcome the commitment to tackle modern slavery and the increased protections for those found to be victims of modern slavery For too long, criminal gangs have profited from our broken asylum system at the expense of vulnerable people who need protection and the British public who pay for it.",3
"The Nationality and Borders Bill will create a fair, but firm system, delivering on our promise to take full control over our borders.",3
"The Bill feels like a series of poor choices made on the basis of ignorance of the evidence, or maybe even contempt for it Let us start with the Bill’s major premise, which is that we are overwhelmed with asylum seekers.",3
"The United Kingdom had 35,000 or so asylum seekers last year; Germany had 120,000; France had 96,000.",3
"By the number of people we take in and consider for asylum each year, we are behind 16 members of the European Union, so we are low or mid-table.",3
"We are an island, so there is an extent to which we are protected; that has some horrific consequences as well, but the notion that we are overwhelmed with asylum seekers is bogus nonsense.",4
"There is a problem with the asylum system, but it is the colossal backlog.",2
"Somehow, even though the number of people claiming asylum here has dropped by 58% in the past couple of decades and by 21% in the past two years, the number of people languishing in the asylum system has increased by 28%.",3
"That is proof that we are overwhelmed not with asylum seekers, but by the incompetence of the Home Office, which is what the Bill ought to be tackling.",3
"There is such a need, but unless the Government allow people to apply for asylum from outside the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom will be complicit in and responsible for people making dangerous crossings.",4
"That is the safer route, but the Bill sets out nothing of the sort Creating two categories of asylum seekers—which I am sure the Government are doing because it winds up namby-pamby liberals and therefore somehow pleases them and their base—is probably illegal under international law.",3
"Maybe that is the argument that might land with Ministers: that it will make things worse Just yesterday, I was talking to one of the Home Office’s own asylum accommodation providers.",3
"I will not name it, because that would not be fair, but it told me that the two-tier system will make no difference whatever to the number of people who come here via the irregular route; it will simply lead to refugees coming here, not claiming asylum and slipping into the informal economy.",3
"In other words, the Government are presenting to the House and the people a charter for a massive increase in exploitation, modern-day slavery, a wicked use of people through trafficking and all the awful things that come about when people go below the radar That seems an obvious consequence.",3
Do the maths: we need overseas labour.,2
"Because of the Government’s barmy, impractical, stupid visa rules Home Secretary, why did you do all this?",3
Why did the Government make provisions to support hospitality and tourism in the past 16 to 17 months if they were only going to kill them off by stupid visa rules at the end?,3
"The simple fact is that, if an Italian restaurant or a gastropub in the Lake district sources half its staff from overseas and half from the local area, if it cannot get the half from overseas and the business therefore closes, as dozens have done, the half who are local will lose their jobs too.",3
So I will use the last few seconds to ask the Government to do something sensible— I and many Conservative Back Benchers think this should happen—and have a youth mobility visa with the countries that are close to us in Europe so that we can at least provide a source of labour to protect excellent businesses from going under because of stupid Government policies.,3
"They have often jumped through a lot of hoops, paid a lot of money and done everything right, and then they see other people pushing to the front of the queue as economic migrants, despite not following all the rules.",3
"If we are to do that, we have to crack down hard on illegal migration and those who profit from it Therefore, I welcome the measures in the Bill.",3
It is right to bring in those tougher penalties and in the legislation to increase the penalties for those who return after being the subject of a deportation order.,3
It is also right that we have tougher measures to limit visas for those third countries that are not co-operating with us.,3
"If other countries do not want to help us and are not taking back their nationals who are being deported—they are not taking back their own citizens from this country—we have to be more symmetrical about things and look again at the visa rules we have for those countries I am proud to support this legislation, which ends a broken system, reduces the chance of people having their lives put at risk and ends some basic unfairnesses in the system that have gone on for far too long.",3
"Since I was elected to Parliament, one of the issues that I have been left in no doubt about whatsoever by many of my constituents is that the UK must take back control of its borders and deal with the tide of illegal immigration.",3
"We have all seen the sad and appalling scenes—images of asylum seekers making the perilous journey across the channel in small boats, on dangerous tides.",3
"The UK has shown itself over many years to be more than generous and hospitable, but there cannot be an indefinite blank cheque for those who come here illegally The Bill, as we know, has three main objectives.",4
The first is to increase the fairness of the system—I emphasise the phrase “fairness of the system”—to better protect and support those in need of asylum.,3
"The Bill deters illegal entry into the United Kingdom, thereby breaking the business model of people-smuggling networks and protecting the lives of those they wilfully endanger.",3
The UK’s legal immigration system is being reformed by the ending of free movement and the introduction of a new points-based immigration system.,3
"In my view, this Bill is intended to tackle illegal migration and asylum seekers and to control the UK borders, and it fulfils the manifesto promise that was made in 2019 Let me set out some of the facts.",3
The number of asylum seeker cases is growing.,3
"There were 29,500 asylum applications in 2020 alone, and many more continue to arrive.",3
"Contrary to popular perception, the UK will continue to resettle genuine refugees directly from regions of conflict and instability.",3
How someone arrives in the UK will impact the type of status they are granted in the UK if their asylum claim is successful.,3
"Ministers rightly argue that that approach will discourage irregular entry into the UK, such as entry across the channel via small boats, as we have discussed, which, again, increased significantly in 2020.",3
"If asylum seekers know that entering the UK illegally via that method is not going to result in a successful claim for asylum, then it may stop.",3
That will also discourage those gangs from wilfully imposing their own selfishness on these vulnerable people Let me move on to immigration enforcement.,3
The Bill will provide our border force with additional powers to search unaccompanied containers located in ports for the presence of illegal migrants.,3
"It will seize and dispose of vessels intercepted and encountered, including disposal through donation to charity if appropriate, and it will stop and divert vessels suspected of carrying illegal migrants to the UK, and, subject to the agreement of the relevant country, such as France, return them to where their sea journey to the UK began.",3
"Almost all these migrants have passed through many other countries, which should by rights have offered them asylum, to get to the UK, which, clearly, people perceive to be a soft touch, and that has to end Currently, there are more than 109,000 asylum cases in the system, 52,000 of which were awaiting an initial decision at the end of 2020.",3
"Around 5,500 have an asylum appeal outstanding and approximately 41,000 cases are subject to removal action.",3
"I therefore welcome the measures outlined in the Bill, and I am clear that our current asylum system is unequivocally in need of reform In conclusion, this is not a moral or an emotional judgment, but a pragmatic one.",3
"When I said that the Bill addresses a problem that does not exist, one of the previous speakers talked of the country being overrun by immigrants.",3
"Member’s words—“innocent” and “vulnerable” people crossing the channel with people smugglers is a problem, but I do not think that the solution to that problem is to criminalise those innocent and vulnerable people.",3
"In fact, to criminalise those innocent and vulnerable people is potentially in breach of our international legal obligations If this Bill becomes law, we risk breaching the 1951 UN refugee convention, the 1961 UN convention on the reduction of statelessness, the UN convention on the law of the sea and the international convention for the safety of life at sea, and we also risk breaching the UN convention on the rights of the child.",3
"But there is not much point in being committed to it in name if they bring legislation to the House that threatens to breach it by its terms, as does the introduction of a two-tier system for refugees, which potentially breaches the right to be free from discrimination and enjoyment of one’s human rights The changes proposed by the Bill potentially undermine the right to life for those at sea.",3
"Changes to the application and appeals process for asylum seekers and provisions regarding credibility, and the weight to be given to evidence, risk breaching the right to a fair trial.",3
"The Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I am a member, has already raised concerns that decision making by the Home Office in immigration matters is not sufficiently independent or rigorous to ensure that human rights are respected, and the Bill will make that worse Why would Scotland want to be part of a Union where decisions like this affecting our international standing and the perception of the state on the world stage are forced through by a Government with such scant regard for human rights and the rule of law?",3
There are millions of displaced people across the world and millions of refugees.,2
"The United Kingdom cannot wash our hands of responsibility for them, particularly when at least some of the reasons for their displacement can be laid at our door and at the door of our foreign policy and our colonial past.",4
"The real mischief that the Bill should seek to tackle, but does not, is that there are insufficient lawful routes for claiming asylum in the United Kingdom.",3
"Yes, resettlement programmes are laudable, but they are not a solution for those claiming asylum because resettlement programmes deal with those already recognised as having a protection need.",3
Those in need of international protection who reach the shores of the United Kingdom should not be criminalised It is time the Home Secretary stopped playing to the gallery and did the hard work necessary to fulfil the United Kingdom’s moral and legal obligations to refugees and asylum seekers.,3
My constituents are very happy to welcome genuine refugees to the UK.,3
"We are taking them now, unlike many constituencies in Scotland where they are not taking asylum seekers, as was pointed out by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon.",3
"It is quite astonishing really My constituents are very happy to take genuine refugees, but they do not want to see an open-door policy, where anybody can just come into the UK and we cannot remove them if they have come here illegally, overstayed their visa or committed a criminal act while they are here, when they should be deported If Opposition Members are really interested in ensuring better and safer legal routes for migration, I cannot understand why they are not arguing for that.",3
Why are they instead arguing that we should just allow the boats to continue?,3
"Totally mad As I was saying, people are fed up of seeing people coming to the UK and being used and abused by illegal gangs.",3
They are fed up of seeing them come here illegally.,2
Today we are seeing exactly the same sorts of lawyers doing exactly the same sorts of things to our immigration and asylum system.,2
One is boat interceptions.,3
"They do not have people arriving by boat in Australia any more, because they have dealt with the system We are also looking at the offshore processing of claims, and it is similar to the Australian system.",3
"The Government, more than any other Government in Europe, are doing the right thing in supporting legal routes from refugee camps.",3
That is exactly what we need to see here Let me turn to immigration offences and enforcement.,2
"People are also fed up of seeing those who have come to the UK and been deported coming back again, and it is right that we are enhancing the sentences for such people—not only when they are initially deported, but if they come back again, when the sentences need to be tougher still.",3
How can Opposition Members not support those sensible provisions on illegal migrants who have been deported?,3
"They want a sensible immigration system whereby people come to the UK based not on their ability to get here, but on their need.",3
"That is what Conservative Members put forward every time—the need of the people in the refugee camps, not the need of the young men who can just make their way here The Bill, in the broader sense, also tackles modern slavery.",3
"Often, those people disappeared into the system after being smuggled here illegally, so the Bill is taking a sensible step.",3
"It will deliver exactly what my constituents want—a fair, balanced immigration system.",3
"From the “go home” vans touring working-class communities to the Windrush scandal that saw black citizens deported, to the hostile environment policy and the attacks on Black Lives Matter, hatred, division and racism are used as weapons of mass distraction to try to shift the blame for Tory policies that hurt the majority of society.",3
"Conservative MPs can groan and shake their heads all they want, but they should save their outrage for the people who will be criminalised, demonised and abused by this legislation, should it pass The Tories have a low view, as I have said, of working-class people and hope that they can whip up anti-immigrant sentiment to distract from their own failures.",3
"In the diverse, multicultural communities across the country that have come together over the last week we have seen a far better country than the one that this Government imagine—a country full of the spirit of community, the spirit of unity, the spirit of hope, and I encourage anyone, regardless of their political party, with an ounce of humanity in them to reject this Bill today I make this speech thinking of the asylum seekers I have met in my immigration surgeries at the Bangladesh centre in my constituency, and thinking of the sons and daughters of asylum seekers who go to school at Bankside Primary in Harehills in my constituency—a school where over 50 languages are spoken.",3
So I urge everyone who is appalled by the idea of offshore asylum seeker processing centres and everyone who is opposed to this to do what is right and vote against the Bill.,3
"I would like to start by saying what neither I nor, I believe, anybody else expressing opposition to the Bill is opposed to, and that is an immigration policy or immigration Acts.",3
"Everybody who is taking part in this debate recognises that there requires to be an immigration policy I remember many years ago, as a young Scottish Justice Secretary, going to visit my counterpart in the Republic of Ireland and expressing concern for the difficulties they were having.",3
"They were requiring to make changes, even constitutional changes, because at one stage anyone who was born in Ireland was guaranteed citizenship, and people were flying in to give birth, to take advantage of that.",3
"Ireland has a proud record on how it deals with immigrants and with those seeking asylum in refugee crises, but it recognised that it had to have an immigration policy So, in opposing the Bill, nobody is suggesting unlimited immigration.",3
"It has to be dealt with in a co-ordinated manner, but equally, this is fundamentally about the manner in which this is being done and, in particular, the steps that are being taken against those who are most vulnerable, those who are most requiring aid, support, sanctuary and whatever else and those who are asylum seekers and refugees.",2
"Having listened to the debate on the monitor in my office, I have to say that the tone and content of some of the speeches from the Opposition underline and reinforce why they are the Opposition and not the Government Analysis has shown that many migrants might actually be economic migrants and not genuine refugees.",3
"Without this Bill, our asylum system is in danger of being continually abused, so we must take steps, as my hon.",3
"Friend has just said, to protect our own borders.",3
"Part 2 of the Bill, which deals with asylum, is understandably vast, so I will focus on some specific points arising from it.",3
It is remarkable that all claims made by asylum seekers are processed in a homogeneous way and that there is absolutely no distinction between those who have entered the UK legally or irregularly.,3
Clause 10 will change things by allowing for such differentiation to occur while making the distinction that all genuine refugees will continue to be afforded the same protections under international law.,3
"Clause 26 will make possible removals to a safe third country while an asylum claim is being heard, further deterring activities that put lives at risk and, in several tragic cases, claim them Clause 41 in part 3 is a key part of the Bill, because it gives more powers to Border Force to meet the specific circumstances faced.",3
"Not only are criminal gangs responsible for facilitating these crossings, but they show no signs of stopping and are growing ever more expansionist, using larger vessels and carrying more people Migrants crossing in small boats have thus far been intercepted and brought back to the UK to have their asylum claims processed.",3
"At present, enforcement powers do not extend to ships in foreign or international waters, and clause 41 would change that by giving Border Force the ability to require migrant vessels to leave UK waters and deter them from our shores.",3
"The clause also provides for controlling the vessel and returning it to a safe country—most likely in these instances where it originated from, so the northern beaches of France or Belgium, or any other country accepting disembarkation Those who oppose the Bill have claimed that by legislating in this way, the UK would somehow be acting in breach of the 1951 UN refugee convention.",3
The 1951 convention allows for different classifications where a refugee may not have come directly from a country of persecution.,3
"In this instance, if migrants have already transited through a safe European country where they could have claimed asylum, their return is not inconsistent with the convention.",3
"It is a fact that people will travel, often by land, through several safe countries to get to the border of northern continental Europe, thereby to embark for Dover or other parts of southern England The simple truth of the matter is that between 2016 and 2019, the UK settled more refugees from outside Europe than any other EU member state.",4
"More than 5,400 family reunion visas were issued to partners and children, and more than 29,000 family reunion visas have been issued in the past five years.",3
"There have been claims that the Bill reduces support for victims of human trafficking, which would be shocking if it were true, but part 4 of the Bill actually strengthens protections for victims of human trafficking and will be supported by a package of non-legislative measures as part of the new plan for immigration to provide enhanced support for victims The public, including my Orpington constituents, want strong but fair border controls.",3
"The Bill is about creating a fairer asylum system, both for those who need aid and for the British public.",3
"I have been visiting them and dealing with asylum cases for more than 45 years now, as a local activist, a local Greater London Council councillor and then as the local Member of Parliament.",3
"People have been talking about the amount of money that smugglers are making, but in the discussions we had yesterday on undocumented migrants we discovered that it costs about £12,000 for anyone to secure status in this country now At the weekend, an asylum seeker—a young Sudanese man—died in the Crowne Plaza hotel in my constituency.",3
I went to meet a group of asylum seekers there.,3
"They have tried various routes out of the terrible situation they are in and they realise that there is realistically only one way of getting out, and that is the illegal route for most of them.",3
"Well, today proves there certainly is, because this Bill institutionalises further racism in our asylum and immigration system.",3
"Time after time I have heard Conservative speakers refer to the 16,000 arriving illegally to claim asylum; cynically, they know that for people desperately seeking safety, there is realistically almost no other way.",3
"There are so few safe routes for asylum seekers to reach this country, and there are no additional mechanisms set out in this Bill.",3
"There are so few resettlement schemes for them, and those that have existed in recent years have been limited by successive Conservative Governments This Government and, unfortunately, others on the far right of British politics have made much of the increase in asylum seekers reaching the UK via the English channel.",3
"If we listen to Home Office statistics, two thirds of them are then accepted as refugees, and appeals push the figure even higher I looked at the figures yesterday, and for the year up to September 2020 the UK received 26,903 asylum applications.",3
"Even countries with smaller economies and populations, such as Spain, Italy and Greece, received more asylum seekers than the UK The myth that we resettle more than any other country in Europe is untrue, because those countries use routes other than a simple resettlement scheme.",4
The truth is that we are not taking our fair share of refugees.,2
"I join all those who ended their speeches by echoing the call that refugees are welcome here To those people I met yesterday, and to the relatives of the young man who died in my constituency at the weekend, I say that refugees are welcome here.",3
"We will welcome refugees and, yes, we know the benefit of those who come here and the significant contributions they make to our country.” A number of MPs have stood up and said, “Listen to the people.” Well, I am listening to my constituents—there will be different views, too—and sometimes we have to stand up for what is right I know some have criticised my colleague who referred to the 1930s, but some people in the 1930s, and particularly some of the right-wing press, prevented a Government from allowing Jewish people to come to this country from Germany.",3
"Yes, we accepted the children, but we did not accept the parents and, unfortunately, they lost their lives in the concentration camps Let us stand up for humanity, let us show the best of this House, let us show the best of our country and let us offer people succour, safety and security through the asylum system, with protection for them and their families.",3
Compassion and robustness go hand in hand when it come to the way in which we manage our borders.,2
"Every Government in every era and every generation have looked for a system that is more efficient, that is safer for those seeking refuge, that is cheaper for taxpayers in the United Kingdom and for the communities taking in refugees, and that is more humane in the way it supports people who have faced some of the most terrible circumstances The website of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says that, although our debate is very much about what is happening in the European neighbourhood, the issue is challenging Governments, countries and populations across the world.",3
"As a constituency Member of Parliament, I have had umpteen contacts from constituents asking me to intervene to prevent the deportation from the UK of someone who has been found to be an illegal immigrant in my constituency who they know, who their friends know and who lives in the neighbourhood.",4
I am yet to have a single contact letting me know about an illegal immigrant that someone wants to see removed.,3
"So there is a conundrum in this debate, which is that our voters and constituents are in general very concerned to see that our borders are effectively managed, but tend to have a very positive view of the migrants and refugees they know in their community and in their neighbourhood Perhaps that reflects the fact that the UK is not a particularly popular destination for asylum in Europe.",3
UNHCR figures indicate that Germany has about 10 times as many refugees as we do in the UK and that the UK is a middling destination in our European neighbourhood for asylum seekers.,3
"For me, it is an essential principle that we build on the success of things such as the Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement scheme, which cut out the people smugglers from the system and enabled communities the length and breadth of the United Kingdom to welcome refugees without any of the challenges we faced with some of the parts of the asylum system We also know that of those who arrive by any route outside of resettlement, about three-quarters are granted asylum under UK law, which shows that most do have a well-founded claim, however they arrive into our country.",3
"The smuggling of people into our country and the rest of Europe is helping to fund terrorist organisations in parts of the world, which are making money out of the deaths and misery of many, many thousands of vulnerable people There are criminals closer to home, and we have seen some particularly hideous cases in the United Kingdom where large numbers of refugees have died in the hands of those criminals because of the way in which they are being smuggling into our country.",2
"I personally saw, on a visit to the Jungle refugee camp in Calais, smugglers driving around offering what is essentially a rate sheet: “If you can pay this many euros, you are allowed to break into a lorry.",3
"If you can pay significantly more, we will smuggle you into the UK in a British-plated car with a British driver.” It is an absolutely evil trade and we have no idea how many people have lost their lives in the waters of the English channel trying to get to refuge in our country, so we must tackle that.",3
"Dispersal was created under Andy Burnham, then the immigration Minister and now the Mayor of Greater Manchester, in 2005.",3
The concept of effective advocacy and advice for refugees at the point of entry to enable them to lodge a really effective claim is critical.,3
We need to ensure that the way in which we work at the border enables us to understand the circumstances of the asylum seeker as fully as possible.,3
"If we are to have a two-tier system that treats people differently according to their means of transit to the UK, we need to recognise that in some parts of the world it may, for example, have been necessary to pay a people smuggler to get out of immediate danger and then to make the rest of the journey by another route.",3
"There have been a number of steps in a positive direction, including the recent announcement about working visas for those seeking asylum The House needs to balance the views and needs of all parts of our country.",3
Our communities are rich in their diversity because of immigration and because of the people we have been helping.,3
"In Lancashire we have taken thousands, and I am proud of us helping those most in need, but for far too long the system has been exploited by people smugglers, criminal gangs and asylum shoppers, who cheat that system.",3
"Friend the Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner, people are paying extra either to break into a lorry or to get into a boat to be shipped across.",3
That is not the right way to try to seek asylum.,3
"It is almost as if they want to see us fail and want to see Britain fail, and that is absolutely wrong The way in which things currently operate is not fair to the most vulnerable people who are in genuine need of asylum, or to the British public, who unfortunately have to pay for it.",3
We must help to ensure that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.,2
"The current trend means that we see refugees reaching a safe country such as France, Greece or Italy—indeed, countries in most of southern Europe—and then pressing on with their journey, paying people smugglers to help them into the UK illegally or falling victim to criminal gangs who exploit them.",3
"We need only see what goes on there to realise that many of these journeys are life-threatening for many people, so we need to do what we can to prevent them In October 2020, a Kurdish-Iranian family tragically died when their overcrowded boat sank off the coast of France.",3
"Every journey across the channel is life-threatening, so we absolutely need to take this seriously and do everything we can to try to prevent anyone from making that journey when it is not necessary Last month was the worst ever recorded for illegal crossings, more than 2,100 people having arrived, and I fear that that figure may be surpassed this month.",3
"Many of the people risking their lives to cross the channel are young men who are economic migrants and are denied legitimate asylum seeker status As Conservatives, we will protect those most in need and put the rights of those who respect the rules above those of the asylum shoppers who take our country for a ride.",3
"We need an asylum system that is fair to everyone—a system that prioritises women and children escaping wartorn countries and those fleeing unwarranted persecution, not a system that is openly gamed by economic migrants or exploited by people smugglers.",2
"I would like to think that the United Kingdom has a reputation for being a generous country, and part of that lies with having a fair and efficient asylum process for those who need it.",4
"Recent stats show that in the year ending March 2021 the UK received 26,903 asylum applications, meaning that possibly that number of people needed a better life with better choices and better opportunities.",3
"There has been a lack of direction in the past number of years regarding the position of asylum seekers, meaning that people are left in disarray, unable to seek work or resettle.",3
"I want to see that system improved in the future; access to the UK asylum system should be based on need, not ability to pay people smugglers, to whom other hon.",3
Members have referred Detention Action—a charity that dedicates much time to ensuring fairness for asylum seekers—has used a great slogan to describe the situation.,3
"In 2019, 24,400 people entered immigration detention in the UK—the lowest figure since 2009.",3
"However, I am not classifying that figure as necessarily low Another major issue surrounding the Bill is that young children are being placed in immigration detention.",3
"While asylum seeking is something that we should take seriously, illegal immigration also needs to be taken into consideration when discussing the Bill.",2
"In the year 2020-21 alone—I conclude with this comment, Mr Deputy Speaker, ever mindful of your request about time—3,500 people are said to have crossed the Channel to enter the UK illegally to work and live without the correct documentation.",3
Individuals should not be criminalised for seeking asylum.,2
"More important, asylum seekers should not be mistreated I call on the Home Office and the Minister to provide the necessary assurance that the United Kingdom can and will deliver a trustworthy haven for those who seek asylum.",3
I wish to see in the legislation that we give protection for those overseas who are persecuted because of their religion and whose human rights are abused.,3
Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) This Bill is the cornerstone of the Government’s commitment to reforming our immigration policy.,3
"Having taken back control, following our departure from the European Union, it is essential that we deliver for our constituents, who want us to take proper, effective control of our borders The Bill will introduce new and tough criminal offences for those entering the country illegally, and introduce life sentences for those who perpetrate the despicable crime of people smuggling—those who would willingly and knowingly put men, women and children in the backs of lorries and in dinghies, and take money for doing so, with not a care in the world for whether their victims will live to see another day, never mind complete their journey.",3
"That means prosecuting those who facilitate it and sending a clear message to those who seek to make such illegal entry into our country We all know that the system as it stands is in need of reform, with lengthy waits for decisions, bureaucracy that makes little sense, endless appeals, and no certainty for anyone in the system.",2
"The Bill will deliver key elements of the Government’s new plan for immigration, on which I and my colleagues on the Government Benches were elected.",3
"The plan addresses our broken asylum system, which sadly has provided incentives to sickening people smugglers and illegal immigrants at the expense of those in conflict zones who are unable to travel The UK has a proud record of supporting those in genuine need of refuge and asylum.",3
"It cannot be right for a decent, civilised society that welcomes those fleeing persecution to allow an unsafe, illegal route to be repeatedly exploited by criminal gangs.",2
"It has made our culture richer and is something to celebrate, but at the same time it is right that that immigration is controlled by the Government and legislation, responding to the needs of those in need around the world in a controlled way, not through a system undermined by criminal gangs sending victims to their deaths in lorries and dinghies The UK is delivering support through the world-class vulnerable persons resettlement scheme, which has protected 25,000 people in the last six years—more than any other European country.",3
"At its heart, the Bill will break human smuggling and trafficking chains, introducing new criminal offences for those attempting to enter the UK illegally and new life sentences for people smugglers.",3
"I know that the majority of my constituents in Darlington will welcome those steps Closing legal loopholes and opening safe routes, ending the horrific practice of people smuggling that has seen thousands put on small, unsafe boats in northern France, is testament to the resolve of the Home Secretary, who has faced the most dreadful personal abuse for doing the right thing by this country.",3
She knows that the overwhelming majority of the British public want to see the problem of illegal entry tackled.,3
It is not fair to the migrants making the dangerous journeys.,2
"It is not fair to the migrants unable to make those journeys, who tend to be women and children, who are perhaps at more risk, and it is not fair to my constituents, and the constituents of all of us in this Chamber, who are paying for the system.",3
"The only beneficiaries are the people smugglers, and we heard from my right hon.",3
"Friend, but I am sure it is only a matter of time—that those people smugglers are making thousands and thousands of pounds for every journey across the channel.",3
"This Bill dramatically changes the incentives involved in the immigration system and the illegal immigration system to deter illegal entry, as well as to remove those with no right to be here and remove them more easily.",3
"We support those in genuine need of asylum—for example, we support those who have been displaced from war zones.",3
We have resettled more refugees in this country than any other country in Europe.,2
"Our vulnerable persons resettlement scheme has resettled 20,000 refugees from Syria in the UK to rebuild their lives.",3
"We should be proud of that, and I am proud of it However, I think the Government are right to try to find a better way, first, to differentiate between economic migrants and refugees, and secondly, to make sure that there is still a route for the most vulnerable, but one that does not mean that most dangerous of journeys.",3
"If were to open our borders completely, as it seems some of the Socialist Campaign Group members want us to do—by the look of it, they are going to be proscribed soon, the way the Leader of the Opposition is going—millions of people would want to come to the UK, because we are an open, tolerant nation.",3
"That is the only moral thing to do On deterring illegal entry, today, like every other day, there are hundreds crossing the channel and taking that risk.",3
"France is a safe country, and they could claim asylum there, and before that they could have claimed asylum in Spain, Italy, Greece or wherever they crossed into the European Union.",4
"But the European Union does not want to defend its border there, because it knows that people just migrate through the European Union to the United Kingdom.",3
"To quote the evidence the Australian Government submitted to the Home Affairs Committee: “Between 2008 and 2013, more than 50,000 people travelled illegally to Australia on more than 820 individual maritime people smuggling ventures.",3
"We are going to put in statute a single standardised minimum notice period for migrants to access justice, and we are going to make that into a one-stop process.",3
"We will also expand the early removal scheme, which will remove foreign national offenders, and we will remove criminals who are currently in our prisons as soon as possible I would like to ask why 60 Labour MPs, none of whom are here—there are only those on the Front Bench—have written to Government opposing the removal of foreign national offenders.",3
"Since I was elected in 2019, one thing many of my constituents have told me they want to see is this country taking back control of its borders.",3
"They are not racist; they are genuine, hard-working, decent, honest people, and they are actually generous to those in genuine need Our asylum and immigration system is not fit for purpose.",2
"It lines the pockets of criminal gangs and people smugglers, and it is not fair on genuinely vulnerable people who need protection.",2
"There appear to be some in the Opposition who cannot see a problem, but there is a reason why they no longer represent constituencies like mine Yesterday saw record numbers of people arriving in this country by boat, with 430 crossing in a single day.",3
"Many of them have travelled across several safe countries; some have paid as much as £5,000 for a ticket to board those illegal crossings and jump the queue for asylum.",3
"Most of the genuine asylum seekers I have met in my constituency could not afford £5,000 and would not be able to make a journey across five countries to get here Of the whopping 8,500 people who arrived here in 2020, 80% are male and 74% are aged between 18 and 39.",3
"Something has to be done, not only to stop abuse, but to ensure that the world’s most genuinely vulnerable asylum seekers are not arriving in this country via legal routes to join huge queues and be left in limbo for months, if not years, by our overburdened system.",3
"It is firmer on criminal gangs of people smugglers and those who enter the UK illegally, it increases the penalty for illegal entry, and it introduces life sentences for the disgraceful people smugglers who put lives at risk to profit from this illegal and dangerous activity.",3
"It is firmer on foreign national offenders, increasing sentences for those who return to the UK in breach of a deportation order.",3
"That will save British taxpayers’ money that could be spent on building back better and levelling up the most left-behind areas, or on actually supporting vulnerable people such as those subject to slavery and people trafficking.",3
"Importantly, the Bill will rebuild the British public’s confidence in our asylum and justice system The Bill is not just firmer; it is fairer.",3
"It is fairer on our border forces, which will now have the power and resources they need to do the job that we have tasked them with—powers to search unaccompanied containers, to seize and dispose of any vessels intercepted, and to stop and divert vessels entering the UK illegally.",3
I have spoken to genuine refugees who have seen some of the most terrible atrocities.,2
"They have been forced to wait for more than a year simply to get an interview date, because they are in a queue behind those who cross the channel illegally.",3
"That is unsurprising, considering that this country has 109,000 outstanding asylum claims that need to be dealt with.",3
"It is at breaking point, and that is utterly unfair on those who follow the proper channels to claim asylum The Bill is also fairer on the British taxpayers, who have voted time and again for the UK to take control of its borders and who, while generous to those in need, do not wish to see that generosity abused.",3
"It is firmer on the criminal gangs that profit from putting others in peril, and firmer on foreign national offenders in breach of a deportation order, but fairer on genuine asylum seekers, on our border forces and on the British people who pick up the tab.",3
"I wonder why Our immigration and asylum system, as we have heard many times today and yesterday, has not worked properly for years.",2
"It is fair to say that leaving the European Union was about many things—it was about controlling our laws, our money, our trade and our borders.",3
"Along with a points-based immigration system, we can look to control our borders further with proper legislation to deal with the issues that have dogged our country for many years.",3
"In the shortish time that I have, I want to make two overall points First, there is an issue that has been raised many times already, the thousands upon thousands of migrants making dangerous crossings to get here.",3
"Quite simply, constituents write to me every single week imploring us to get to grips with this situation, to have control of our borders, of who is here and of how many people are entering the country.",3
"In doing so, the Bill has to deal with the criminal element and deter people from coming en masse to claim illegal asylum The Bill, as we know, will make it a crime to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission.",3
"In doing so, these measures will act as a strong deterrent to curb those who, as I said in my interventions, have many times risked life and limb to come here We also know that people are being led here or smuggled by gangs, and the Bill has new powers to deal with that.",3
"It is absolutely right that we prosecute those people Secondly, I draw attention to our ability to properly protect and support those who genuinely need safe asylum here.",3
"As the Home Secretary said yesterday, we need a firm but fair asylum system that provides a safe haven to those fleeing persecution and oppression.",3
"I do not think anybody on either side of the House has disagreed with that point Those claiming asylum should be doing it in the first safe third country they travel through, and I welcome the provisions in the Bill to try to achieve that.",3
"We have heard a lot about this in the past few weeks, and we should not forget that we are the third highest contributor of overseas development aid in the entire world, and we have resettled more refugees than any other country in Europe.",3
"It is right that, if a person ends up on our shores, their asylum claim should be impacted, because it has to be part and parcel of the deterrent mechanism to try to stop people risking their life to be here We will continue, no doubt, to resettle genuine refugees directly from regions of conflict and instability.",3
"I mention that not just because it will be a lovely do with great wine, but because I have a great deal of respect for the way that Australia has handled the entire debate around immigration and asylum through Operation Sovereign Borders, which my hon.",4
"Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Aaron Bell) gave a great account of earlier Wanting to have integrity of one’s borders and an immigration system that suits one’s nation, yet some out there would have us believe that that is not only shameful, but thoroughly unpopular with the public.",3
"That is not my experience Shall we just remember the general election of 2019, in which one party stood on a manifesto with a promise to tackle immigration as a key tenet?",3
Local people across Bishop Auckland have not been shy in letting me know their views on the channel crossings and the wider asylum system.,3
"Their overarching opinion is not bigoted or racist, but it is clear that we need to protect our borders.",3
We must tackle illegal immigration.,2
We must crack down on the criminal gangs and people smugglers and their exploitation of some of the most vulnerable people.,2
"We know that those who board small boats or cling to lorries to make the perilous journey across the channel are often being exploited by sophisticated criminal gangs of people smugglers who charge thousands upon thousands for a ticket and a new life in the UK, and that is precisely what they sell.",3
"It is exactly the sort of thing that the Bill aims to tackle For me, people smugglers are the key to cracking this issue.",3
"There seems to be a very strange perception that the Bill seeks to stop us offering asylum to those genuinely seeking refuge, but would that not be thoroughly un-British?",3
"From the Kindertransport to the Bosnian genocide, the UK has a proud history of welcoming people fleeing war and persecution, and we should be proud of our reputation as a tolerant nation holding out its arms to the most vulnerable I am very proud that our nation has resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any other European nation.",4
"With more than 25,000 refugees and 29,000 close relatives welcomed to the UK since 2015, our record shows global Britain in action.",3
"Member for Glasgow North East (Anne McLaughlin) say that I should be ashamed to support this Bill, but the Nationality and Borders Bill will fix our broken asylum system with a dual approach, tackling dangerous and exploitative illegal routes while honouring our moral obligation to provide safety and security for the world’s most vulnerable.",3
"In Ipswich, we have extended the hand of friendship to huge numbers of refugees over the years.",3
"We have a very significant Kurdish community in Ipswich, which has made a massive contribution to the town, supported by the Suffolk refugee centre Only recently I was in the Bloom Lounge, which is quite a trendy, upmarket cocktail bar in Ipswich, where I had pornstar martinis and all that sort of stuff.",3
They were refugees.,3
The local Conservative party in Ipswich is a party of refugees—far more so than the local Labour party We have a major problem here.,2
We must realise that there are those who make the decision to come to this country illegally.,2
They shun the legal process and come here illegally—break the law.,2
Every person from that category who stays limits our capacity to show compassion towards the most genuine of refugees.,2
"There is also a limit to how many refugees we can take, so we need to be realistic about that.",3
Each one of those people who decides to come here illegally—some are economic migrants—means that one fewer family can be supported.,2
"They welcome immigration, and they want to extend the hand of friendship, but what they do not want is lawlessness.",3
"Ultimately, the people of this country voted to take back control of our borders and they do not want a situation in which we are dependent on the French playing ball for us to be able to do so.",3
"It is the Conservative party’s position to have a humane system that welcomes genuine refugees through a rules-based system, but that acknowledges that many people attempting this route are not refugees.",3
"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for working so hard to get all colleagues in The issue of our borders has always attracted attention and the strongest feelings both here in the House and across the country.",3
"Well, we can see from the Bill that it means improving support for refugees to help them build their lives in the UK with an enhanced integration package when they come here.",3
"It is inhumane, not fair at all, and it needs to be speeded up We also have to tackle the illegal route by making the unsafe route less attractive, and that means tackling the evil of people traffickers.",2
There are huge links between people trafficking and modern slavery.,2
"Other measures in the Bill will prove attractive as well, such as the speedier removal of foreign criminals Overall we have a system that is broken.",3
"They have been keen to use blood-curdling language to criticise those who may take different views, but I am absolutely sure that the Government are right to look for a better system, to promote the legal over the illegal, to focus on need, to tackle organised crime and to support people better when they get here.",3
"As if the inhumanity in the way the Government propose to treat asylum seekers is not bad enough, they go further by deciding to punish victims of modern slavery.",3
The Bill peddles the Government’s signature toxic politics of fear and hostility by changing the standard of proof for determining if someone has a well-founded fear of persecution and making it more difficult for people to be recognised as victims of human trafficking.,3
"Rather than breaking the business model, the Government have breathed new life into it by pushing people further into the arms of smugglers.",3
"Meanwhile, the Bill gives the Secretary of State new powers to act like the playground bully in delaying or suspending visa processing for citizens of countries that she believes are unco-operative with removals.",3
It does nothing to address the crisis in our asylum system.,2
"That is quicker, safer and easier than illegally crossing the channel in a dinghy.",3
"We are not just running Europe’s resettlement programme; as we speak, we are bringing locally engaged staff from Afghanistan to the UK, and we have opened up a route for British nationals overseas from Hong Kong to come here, escaping the oppressive regime of the Chinese Communist party.",3
"In addition, 29,000 people have come in the past six years as part of refugees family reunions.",3
"I am very disappointed, as I said in my intervention, when I was able to get in, that out of the 32 local authorities in Scotland only one, Glasgow, takes dispersed asylum seekers.",3
"Moreover, when it comes to taking unaccompanied asylum seeking children under the national transfer scheme, Scotland took only a very small handful of the 600 or so who were transferred last year.",3
Illegal immigration undermines that choice.,2
"Instead of the UK being able to choose the children and families most in need, illegal immigration instead allows those who pay people smugglers or who are strong to push their way to the front of the queue.",2
"This Bill contains provisions such that people arriving by small boat and other illegal means will be liable to prosecution and a four-year jail term, and people smugglers will face a life sentence.",3
Let me be clear: nothing in this Bill would have made the Kindertransport from the 1930s illegal.,3
"Opposition Members should study article 31 of the refugee convention, which makes it clear that it is permitted to impose penalties where someone has not come “directly” from a place of danger and where they did not have a reasonable opportunity to claim asylum somewhere else.",3
"The people coming from France are not coming directly from a place of danger, as required by article 31, and they did have a reasonable chance to claim asylum in France.",3
The Bill will ensure that we identify genuine victims of modern slavery and avoid unmeritorious claims that are designed to delay removal or deportation.,3
"We hope that by encouraging people to bring their claims upfront in one go, asylum claims and matters involving modern slavery and human rights will be identified early and properly, and that we avoid some of the abuses that we have unfortunately seen all too often Some Members raised questions about detention, claiming that it was indefinite.",3
"There are frequent opportunities to apply for immigration bail, in addition to the protections afforded by article 5 of the ECHR.",3
"We will do so, but the public also expect us to protect our borders from illegal immigration and to promptly remove those with no right to be here.",2
"When the Labour party votes against it in a few minutes, it is voting against border control, and against removing dangerous foreign criminals who pose a threat to our constituents.",3
"The Labour party may not be prepared to protect our borders, but the Government are.",3
The Statement is apparently geared to what the Government describe as “illegal immigration”.,3
"This is manifestly unfair to those desperately waiting to be resettled in the UK.” It also refers to the system being overwhelmed, and to the “persistent failure to enforce our immigration laws” Who exactly do the Government think is responsible for that failure which they have now recognised?",3
The Statement also refers to the “pathway to citizenship to enable over five million people in Hong Kong to come to the UK.” We welcome this.,3
"Can the Government also confirm that there is no restriction on the numbers of people in Hong Kong who are rightly allowed to come to the UK being able to do so The Statement says that, under the Government’s broken system, 109,000 claims are sitting in the asylum queue.",3
Are the Government going to tell us that it is all the fault of “leftie lawyers” or will they at last accept responsibility for the system which they now describe as “broken” and “collapsing” The Government have previously told us about pending agreements with France to stop criminal gangs involved in the terrible crime of human trafficking.,3
"The Statement is silent on that issue, though the policy statement tells us that, in 2019, 32,000 attempts to enter the UK by unauthorised groups were prevented in northern France The Government have previously referred to those who have arrived here through non-recognised routes being returned to the first country in which they could have sought asylum, or to another country.",3
With which countries have the Government reached agreement to take back those seeking asylum who have arrived here through non-recognised routes?,3
"Is it their view of the provisions of international law and of the Refugee Convention that refugees fleeing war and persecution have to claim asylum in the first safe country through which they pass, and that they have no right to transit through another country to get to this country to claim asylum?",4
"What safe and legal routes currently exist by which refugees, including children, can reach this country, following our departure from the EU and the ending of the Dublin arrangements?",3
Is there any limit on the number of refugees who can come to the UK by safe and legal routes?,4
"If there are no, or minimal, safe and legal routes, that is only going to make dangerous and unauthorised entries to this country, including through traffickers—whether by small boat, air, in the back of a lorry or a shipping container—more, not less likely The Government claim that, since our departure from the EU, we have control of our borders.",3
"Does claiming that we have control of our borders mean that, at all our ports of entry, the level of checks will be such that the likelihood of successful, unauthorised entry into this country is minimal Finally, how will success or failure of the policies set out in the Statement be judged?",3
"My Lords, the Statement claims to have taken back control of legal immigration by ending free movement.",3
"Not only can EU citizens continue to enter the UK without a visa, using the e-passport gates at UK airports, but rather than taking back control of legal immigration the Government have extended the use of these e-passport gates to a further seven countries.",3
"As a result, thousands were turned away at the UK border every year.",3
Is this not because safe and legal routes for genuine asylum seekers are inadequate or non-existent?,2
How many safe and legal routes are open to genuine asylum seekers?,4
What advice does she have for legitimate seekers of sanctuary in those parts of the world with no safe and legal routes to the UK The Statement says that the UK’s asylum system should be based on need.,3
"It states: “The Contracting States shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees... provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.” Are the Government’s proposals to penalise those who do not use safe and legal routes—routes which do not currently exist and for which the Government have no firm plans or timetable—not in contravention of its international obligations?",3
The Statement talks about someone illegally entering the UK from France.,3
Can the Minister say on which piece of legislation the Government rely when they claim that asylum seekers who travel through a safe country to get to the UK can only claim asylum in that safe country?,3
"Even if they had claimed asylum in an EU country, what mechanism will the Government use to deport them, now that the UK is no longer part of the Dublin regulation The Statement claims that the immigration system “is collapsing” under the pressure of asylum applications.",3
"In the early 2000s, around 100,000 people a year were claiming asylum in the UK.",3
"In 2020, it was 36,000—a reduction of almost two-thirds, despite an increase in the number of people crossing the channel in small boats.",3
"Is the reason for the increase in channel crossings not due to the fact that people can no longer claim asylum from outside the UK Can the Minister confirm how many of the 42,000 failed asylum seekers who have not left the country are in the process of appealing a Home Office decision, when, on average, 50% of those claims are usually successful?",3
"Of those who have exhausted the legal process, why has the Home Office not deported them This is not a common-sense approach to controlling immigration.",3
"This Statement highlights a catalogue of government failures, along with an illegal proposal to discriminate against those legally seeking sanctuary in the UK and a hollow promise to help the most vulnerable at some unspecified date in the future.",3
The policy has thrown open the UK border to even more countries while slamming the door shut on genuine asylum seekers.,3
The last question that the noble Lord asked was: why has the Home Office not deported people who have exhausted their claims?,3
"Obviously, if someone has a visa and the situation changes while they are in this country, that is another legal route.",4
"If there is no visa regime in place in the country of origin, people can travel to the UK to claim asylum.",4
"But, as I say, there are the three obvious routes, including resettlement, and a consultation process is under way, which will elucidate the answers for the Government to consider The noble Lords, Lord Rosser and Lord Paddick, talked about controlling our borders and leaving the EU.",3
One of the reasons why the British public decided that they wanted to leave the EU was so that we could take control of our borders.,3
"Appeals are frustrating the whole process of giving genuine people asylum, and it is important that we do not allow gaming of the system.",2
"We want the most vulnerable to be able to avail themselves of our asylum The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, asked about pending agreements with France.",3
"He and the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, asked whether we are complying with the refugee convention.",3
The number of people under it was based on the ability of local authorities to take asylum seekers.,3
"I hope this will be changed Is the Minister certain that this Bill will comply with the convention, as the charity Refuge says that the measures contained in it are not compliant with the Istanbul convention, which states that “provisions of this Convention by the Parties … measures to protect the rights of victims, shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as … national or social origin … migrant or refugee status” As such, the Bill leaves women with insecure immigration status, including asylum-seeking women and those who are appeal-rights exhausted, without the protection required by the convention.",3
"This should be a Bill for all survivors of domestic abuse, regardless of their immigration status.",3
"All migrant survivors should be able to access financial support and other benefits, regardless of immigration status or visa type.",3
"Women with no recourse to public funds must be able to access the specialist support they need The Government’s report of October 2020 on progress to ratify the convention states on page 8 support for a migrant victims pilot scheme that “will help to obtain the evidence needed to develop sustainable solutions for all migrant victims of domestic abuse over the longer-term.” However, it also records that Articles 4 and 59 are under review.",3
"I trust that the Minister will take the opportunity to ensure that this Bill will give full compliance to the convention, to provide greater protection for women with insecure immigration status, including asylum-seeking women.",3
Organisations working with migrant survivors of domestic abuse have shown for many years how the current system excludes these women from life-saving services and how its interaction with immigration enforcement inevitably leads to survivors avoiding asking for support The Domestic Abuse Bill is an historic opportunity to ensure that Britain’s domestic abuse services are available to all survivors.,3
"Without these changes, migrant survivors will continue to suffer violence and abuse without being able to access support.",2
"There is no mention of how to provide services for migrant individuals, as recommended by the Joint Committee, so much of whose work has been integrated into the Bill.",3
We are far from dealing adequately with the needs of migrant women who have no recourse to public funds.,2
"We welcome the £1.5 million that has been set aside for a migrant victims support scheme, but this can be only a temporary fix.",3
"Will this exercise provide a long-term policy strategy to fulfil the conditions—both the letter and the spirit—of Articles 59 and 4.3 of the Istanbul convention Add to all that the conflict of roles on the part of the Home Office, which has to deal with the process of settling people’s immigration needs while addressing the need to offer them support as victims of domestic abuse.",3
"Is it any wonder that some women fear that they will be met with deportation rather than assistance As a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and its migration committee, I feel some shame that the United Kingdom stands alongside countries such as Bulgaria, Hungary and Ukraine in not yet having ratified the Istanbul convention.",3
"As long as we fail to address the needs of migrant women, we can only report to the Council of Europe that the matter is under review.",3
"It is going to become increasingly important, not just in Bangladesh, small island states and the increasingly arid regions, but right here in the UK, with floods, extreme weather events, fires, heatwaves, droughts and, above all, immigration pressure, as the population of the world seek a living when their territory becomes increasingly hostile due to climate-change impacts These are big lists associated with the COP 26 and associated commitments.",3
"He needs a world vision for what our economy will do in climate change terms, and he needs to reinstate now, as an earnest good intent, the overseas aid budget after its cut and stop subsidising Drax in inappropriate biomass extraction, which is adversely impacting on international biodiversity I finish with a personal reflection on why all that action over the next 12 months is important.",3
"This is a major cause of the internal refugee problem that Madagascar suffers, as the population in the south-east moves to the north.",2
Mass movements of refugees will only increase.,2
"In a year when double the number of migrants have gone to extraordinary lengths to cross the English Channel in small boats, we need to reflect on what a growing global refugee problem will mean for them and for us here in the UK.",3
"The overseas patrol squadron responsible for this consists of four minor war vessels, which assist the Marine Management Organisation in fishery protection.",3
"As well as fisheries duties, these ships have a responsibility for the security of oil platforms and wind farms, plus all assets in the seas around the United Kingdom, as well as a duty to assist other government agencies in protecting our coastline from illegal immigrants, terrorists, drug runners, people smugglers and organised crime.",3
As the Minister responsible for foreign affairs—and I am sure I reflect the sentiments of my noble friend Lady Goldie—I regard that comment with some trepidation.,3
"I, as the Minister responsible for foreign affairs and development affairs in your Lordships’ House, along with the Minister for Defence recognise not just the richness of this debate but the value, expertise and insight that your Lordships provide in challenging the Government and in shaping the future direction of our great country We have had recognition of the various issues.",3
"This is a year of global leadership, as has been recognised by several noble Lords, including my noble friend Lady Meyer, and we are putting at its heart the health response and the challenges around COP 26, and focusing attention on these important issues The integrated review has set out our Prime Minister’s vision for a stronger, more prosperous union in 2030 and outlined the actions we will take, at home and abroad, to realise that vision in a more competitive age.",3
"The US remains a central and key partner to our relationships across the world, whether through multilateral organisations or by co-ordinating across a range of foreign policy issues, including on Iran, Russia, China and Myanmar.",3
I assure my noble friend Lord Northbrook on the specific issue of the overseas territories and our preparation.,3
"We have helped them during the Covid challenge and supplied vaccines directly, and we stand ready for any challenges that may be faced by the overseas territories, and indeed the wider Caribbean, as the hurricane season comes forward The noble Lord, Lord Alton, again a great champion of human rights, talked rightly about the emerging situation in Tigray, particularly in respect of sexual violence.",3
"It is important that we bring communities together In this case, the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, talked about conflict management and resolution, supporting refugees within Africa.",3
"Settlements are illegal, and the only way to resolve this—for the long term, for a sustainable, peaceful solution—is a secure, safe Israel, living side by side with an independent, sovereign Palestinian state.",2
We are looking for an integrated approach to foreign policy and international development.,3
"In this respect, we have also acted according to our words by putting £11.6 billion into international climate finance and setting an ambitious 10-point green plan to reach net zero by 2050 The integrated review has sent a clear message that we are very much joined-up in our thinking and strategic in our approach.",3
"Those who turned out on Clapham common did so for a vigil but ended up being driven off the common by the police, who saw it as an illegal demonstration.",3
There are 80 million people on this planet who are refugees.,2
"They are stuck in refugee camps, they are stuck on borders and they are stuck in desperate levels of poverty.",2
"I am not defending people traffickers or smugglers or anything like that, but they are the symptom, not the cause.",2
"The causes of instability are the inequalities on this planet When the Government propose to dramatically increase expenditure on defence and armaments and turn their back on the possibility of a global treaty to ban nuclear weapons, and at the same time cut overseas aid, they are not dealing with the problems of the world; they are ignoring them or, indeed, making them worse.",3
"This is the type of Queen’s Speech that actually justifies the why I and many of my colleagues won the red wall seats in 2019 We are getting tough on law and order, we are getting tough on illegal immigration and we are winning the culture war.",3
"Our asylum system is broken, and the eagerly awaited sovereign borders Bill will ensure illegal immigrants cannot claim asylum if they have travelled through a safe country to get here.",2
This is excellent news for genuine asylum seekers who do need our help Our brave ex-servicemen should not have to worry about getting a knock on the door 40 years after serving in Northern Ireland.,3
"We should move to do every elected office in this country through a first-past-the-post system Separately, through our new borders Bill, we will fix the loopholes in our asylum system so that no human trafficking gang is able to take advantage of our generosity and humanity to fill their own pockets.",3
"Our new plan for immigration will protect and support those in genuine need of asylum; deter illegal entry into the UK; create new legal, safe routes to asylum; break the business model of criminal trafficking networks; and remove more easily from the UK those with no right to be here Redcar and Cleveland is over 300 miles away from Dover, but illegal immigration is still one of the biggest issues that my constituents contact me about, and for years their concerns have been dismissed by a political class who are not willing to face up to the challenge of illegal immigration and who are too quick to brand anyone who challenges illegal immigration a racist.",3
"The most compassionate approach to illegal immigration has to be to stop people climbing in the back of lorries or in dinghies across the channel, and that is what our plan aims to do Finally, as we build back better, we must build back greener too.",3
"I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time The British people have had enough of open borders and uncontrolled immigration; enough of a failed asylum system that costs the taxpayer more than £1 billion a year; enough of dinghies arriving illegally on our shores, directed by organised crime gangs; enough of people drowning on these dangerous, illegal and unnecessary journeys; enough of people being trafficked and sold into modern slavery; enough of economic migrants pretending to be genuine refugees; enough of adults pretending to be children to claim asylum; enough of people trying to gain entry illegally ahead of those who play by the rules; enough of foreign criminals, including murderers and rapists, who abuse our laws and then game the system so that we cannot remove them.",3
"Is not the truth of the matter that too often our courts exaggerate the significance of international treaties and obligations and, by so doing, frustrate the process by which we deport illegal immigrants, including large numbers of foreign criminals?",2
"From today, I will be granting indefinite leave to remain to refugees resettled under our world-leading resettlement schemes, giving them the vital freedom to succeed from the moment that they arrive in our country and, importantly, offering certainty and stability to help them rebuild their lives from day one.",3
"That is in addition to the type of scheme we have set up for British nationals overseas from Hong Kong whose liberties were restricted and who are now able to live freely in the UK, with a full pathway to citizenship, thanks to the route that we opened up this year.",3
New pilots to support refugees into work are already happening.,3
Community sponsorship schemes that are well-established and have been established over recent years are making an enormous difference and helping local communities to support refugees directly.,3
"We want to do more, and we are empowering more schemes like these every day Those displaced by conflict and violence will also be able to benefit from access to our global points-based immigration system to enable skilled people who have been displaced and who have fled their homes to come to the UK safely and legally through established routes.",3
Up to 100 refugees in Jordan and Lebanon will be supported first to gain sponsorship from a UK employer.,3
"Providing greater support to refugees arriving safely will reduce the incentive to enter the country dangerously and illegally, because when the British people object to illegal entry, they are right to make the case as to it being absolutely abhorrent.",3
"In 2020, 8,500 people arrived in the UK by small boat, 87% of whom were men and 74% of whom were aged 18 to 39.",3
"Those who claim that it is heartless to stop these illegal crossings have it all the wrong way round, because it would be heartless and immoral to let them continue to do so through these dangerous and perilous journeys.",3
"People have drowned in the channel, and thousands, some only recently, just three weeks ago, have died in the Mediterranean It is not just illegal sea journeys that are lethal.",2
People-smugglers are motivated by profit.,3
They line their pockets with the takings to finance other crimes such as drugs and firearms-trafficking.,3
"They do not organise illegal entry by small boat and in the back of lorries out of kindness Three weeks ago, to give another example, late at night, I received what I can only describe as a sickening call from officials at the Home Office.",3
They said that people smugglers in northern France had forced a mother and father to get into a small boat at gunpoint.,3
"They said that their family, their two young daughters, would be put in the next boat to make the crossing.",3
"When the parents refused to be separated from their children, the people smugglers threatened them again The anguish and distress of those parents is absolutely unthinkable, but it is all too common for families to be put into many such perilous situations by criminal gangs.",3
Organised gangs involved in exploiting and trafficking children are of course involved in modern-day slavery.,2
It is illegal to arrive in UK waters without permission.,4
Those who bring migrants to the UK and facilitate illegal entry will now face a life sentence.,3
A maximum prison sentence for entering the country illegally will increase from six months to four years.,3
"We are sending—we need to send—a signal to those criminal gangs that there is increased risk of paying for propping up criminal activity to get to the UK illegally The Bill will also give Border Force additional powers, including powers to seize vessels used to facilitate illegal entry to the UK.",3
"Border Force will be able to search all freight for people suspected of seeking illegal entry, to prevent illegal trafficking and facilitation, like the case of almost 50 minors who were found recently hidden in tiny crevices in the back of a lorry with no chance of escape.",3
"In addition to the changes and the powers for Border Force, we intend to make the border fully digital, which will not only allow us to count people in and out, but, importantly, help us to stop dangerous people coming here.",3
Electronic travel authorisations have been a major step in our border security.,3
"Carriers will check that passengers have the digital authorisation, or another form of digital permission such as a visa, before they travel.",3
"We are also increasing the maximum penalty for hauliers caught entering the UK with an illegal migrant onboard from £2,000 to £5,000 In addition to many of the changes included in the Bill, we will introduce new accommodation and reception centres, which are already used by many countries across Europe and elsewhere.",3
That will expedite the removal of people without a legitimate need to claim asylum in the UK In recent years we have seen some of the most shocking cases of grown adults—mostly men—claiming asylum as children.,3
This will stop people falsely claiming to be children and protect genuine children from being moved into the adult asylum system The British public are incredulous that it is so hard to remove foreign criminals and failed asylum seekers from our shores.,3
We are therefore amending the early removal scheme to help us to remove foreign criminals from the UK as early as possible.,3
The British people have also had enough of foreign criminals getting one over on us.,3
One foreign national offender first claimed asylum in 2001.,3
"He chose to leave the UK voluntarily in 2009, re-entering in 2011 with his wife and child and claiming asylum for a second time.",3
He was deported in 2015 after a 15-month sentence for sexual assault on a child.,3
He returned to the UK in breach of a deportation order in 2017 and was arrested and detained.,3
He then went on to make a fresh asylum claim.,3
"Things cannot continue like this, and we must change the law so that we can remove dangerous foreign criminals and ensure that justice is done The Bill raises the minimum sentence for any foreign criminal who returns to the UK in breach of a deportation order from six months to five years.",3
"Friend the Member for Maidenhead could recount many tales from her time as Home Secretary—and this has become standard practice when it comes to too many of these cases with foreign national offenders and others Time and time again, we see murderers, rapists and child abusers launching numerous last-minute claims to attempt to try to stay in the UK.",3
"Gentleman will have his chance to speak shortly There has been an alarming increase in the number of illegal entrants and foreign national offenders, including child rapists and people who pose a national security risk seeking modern-day slavery referrals to avoid immigration detention and frustrate removal from the UK One individual, who was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK, had that leave revoked following persistent offending that led to a prison sentence adding to more than 12 months.",3
"They were subject to a deportation order, a decision upheld by the courts.",3
"On the day that they were due to be removed, they went on to make an asylum claim.",3
"It is absolutely right, as I have said throughout my remarks this afternoon, that we are doing the right thing to support genuine victims and genuine asylum seekers.",3
People claiming asylum or human rights protections will be required to provide relevant information relating to being a victim of slavery or human trafficking within a specified period.,3
The Bill gives the Home Secretary power to grant British citizenship to people who would have become British citizens if not for unfairness and exceptional circumstances beyond their control.,3
"For example, in one case, an individual was refused citizenship due to an absence from the UK on a given day, despite many years of previous residence.",3
Of course it was not his fault The Bill provides further flexibility to waive residency requirements to help members of the Windrush generation and others acquire British citizenship more quickly.,3
That will also mean that children unfairly denied British overseas territory citizenship can finally acquire citizenship here.,3
The “Windrush Lessons Learned Review” by Wendy Williams also said that immigration and nationality law is complex.,3
"The Bill gives the Home Secretary the power to simplify and consolidate immigration law so that we can address many of the citizenship anomalies that have existed for too long—for decades, in fact The British people are generous and compassionate.",3
"Member for Rhondda earlier, they give billions of pounds every year in overseas aid to provide support in countries around the world, to empower countries and communities and to invest in many economies.",3
It is also central to our new plan for immigration.,3
"It goes a long way to addressing decades of failure and challenges, in the law and illegal migration and in immigration courts and tribunals, in the way in which I have just reflected upon.",3
The Windrush scandal has shone a spotlight on many of the anomalies that have existed when it comes to citizenship.,3
"We will change those areas, with secure borders and rules that will be easy to understand.",3
"That is part of the cumulative end-to-end change that we seek to introduce We want to slam the door on foreign criminals, put organised crime gangs out of business, and of course give help and support to those in genuine need.",3
"I beg to move, That this House declines to give a Second Reading to the Nationality and Borders Bill, notwithstanding the need to address the increasing number of dangerous boat crossings in the English Channel, because the Bill breaches the 1951 Refugee Convention, does not address the Government’s failure since 2010 to competently process asylum applications which has resulted in a backlog of cases and increased costs to the taxpayer, fails to deal with the serious and organised crime groups who are profiteering from human trafficking and modern slavery, does not address the failure to replace the Dublin III regulations to return refugees to safe countries, fails to re-establish safe routes and help unaccompanied child refugees, and fails to deliver a workable agreement with France to address the issue of boat crossings We on these Benches will be opposing this Bill.",3
"We on these Benches do not want to see people risking their lives making a sea crossing in some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, often in boats that are unfit for purpose, but the measures proposed will not address that By judging claims on the type of journey people make, Ministers will create “a discriminatory two-tiered approach to asylum” Those are not my words but the words of the United Nations Refugee Agency.",3
Any proposals—I will come to some in a moment—to address this profoundly serious issue must be compliant with the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees We should in this House remember the circumstances in which that convention was created.,3
"Member for Croydon South (Chris Philp), the Minister for immigration compliance, says, but do not take my word for it.",3
"This is what the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says about the proposals: “The international refugee protection system, underpinned by the 1951 Convention, has withstood the test of time and it remains a collective responsibility to uphold and safeguard it.",3
"If States, like the UK, that receive a comparatively small fraction of the world’s asylum-seekers and refugees appear poised to renege on their commitments, the system is weakened globally and the role and influence of the UK would be severely impacted.",3
"UNHCR is concerned that the Plan, if implemented as it stands, will undermine the 1951 Convention and international protection system, not just in the UK, but globally.” If the Minister doubts that, this is what the United Nations Refugee Agency had to say ahead of this Second Reading debate: “Plans to create a new lower class of refugees are discriminatory, breach commitments in the Refugee Convention and should be dropped” They are breaching commitments in the refugee convention that a past British Government who truly believed in a global Britain had signed In fact, the UN Refugee Agency said the two-tier approach is: “a recipe for human suffering, social problems, inefficiency and greater cost to the taxpayer.” Frankly, it is a dangerous and ill-thought-out proposal with profound consequences.",3
"Unfortunately, I have had no such indication beyond leaks to the media, a fact which will probably not surprise him Last month, the High Court judgment on Napier barracks found inadequate health and safety conditions and a failure to screen victims of trafficking and other vulnerabilities.",3
No wonder the independent chief inspector of borders and Her Majesty’s inspector of prisons published an emergency report that raised “serious safeguarding concerns”.,3
"On asylum accommodation, this Government have failed and failed dangerously The idea that this Bill helps those fleeing violence and persecution does not stand up to scrutiny.",3
The Bill says that evidence submitted late without good reason should be given only “minimal weight” by asylum judges.,3
"But there are many reasons why refugees, and particularly victims of human trafficking, cannot provide evidence at an early stage, not least the fact it is difficult for survivors of trauma to talk about their experience immediately, including—and, indeed, especially—women and other survivors of sexual violence.",3
"It fails victims of human trafficking, and it is a glaring missed opportunity to address the vile crime of people smuggling.",2
"Instead, the Government will turn their back on some of the most vulnerable people on Earth The Bill changes the law so that helping an asylum seeker will no longer need to be done “for gain” to attract criminal liability.",3
"It could criminalise the Royal National Lifeboat Institution for saving people at sea, and it seems to take no account whatsoever of the international law of the sea, which requires ships’ captains to assist those who are in distress.",3
"The Home Secretary shakes her head, but in the 2019 report “Responding to irregular migration: A diplomatic route” the Foreign Affairs Committee warned of exactly that: “A policy that focuses exclusively on closing borders will drive migrants to take more dangerous routes, and push them into the hands of criminal groups.” The Home Secretary should remember that because she was a member of the Committee at the time and her name is attached to the report While we are debating—or at least should be debating—a plan for refugees, we should cast our minds back to last week and the failure to restore the 0.7% commitment to international aid.",3
"The work that was going on around the world to tackle the refugee crisis has been starved of funds, with programmes suddenly cut off.",3
"It will not tackle people smugglers, and it will not protect victims of human trafficking.",2
"As ever, they talk tough, but deliver nothing As it stands, the Bill is a charter for human trafficking.",3
"First, we must help to ensure that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.",3
"The current trend, where refugees reach a safe country and then press on with their journey, can only benefit criminal gangs and expose refugees to grave danger.",2
The refugee convention does not state that refugees must claim asylum in the first safe country they come to.,4
"Obviously that is not applicable to us now, and indeed the EU has since changed the Dublin regulation Secondly, we need to improve how we distinguish between refugees fleeing persecution and economic migrants, which will help to target support on those refugees who need it most, as well as encouraging people to support such a measure if they see that the people who are coming are genuinely refugees.",3
"Thirdly, we need a better approach to managing economic migration, which recognises that all countries have the right to control their borders.",3
"We must all commit to accepting the return of our own nationals when they have no right to remain elsewhere Sadly, as the Home Secretary said, the business of people trafficking has increased in recent years.",3
"We have been very strong on international co-operation, and we must encourage more countries around the world to see this as an issue on which they should be working with us, and others I recognise that the Bill focuses on differentiating between those who came here legally and illegally, and I understand why the Government have gone down that route, but that in itself does not address the issue of better differentiating between refugees and economic migrants.",3
"I hope that the Government will give some thought to how they can work internationally to try to deal with that The concept that Britain could process asylum claims outside the UK came up when I was Home Secretary, and there was a lot of discussion on it in the European Union, but we did not go down that route because of practical concerns.",3
There is also the problem of what we do with those people who are rejected for asylum but cannot be returned to their country of origin.,2
"The concept of allowing asylum to be granted outside the UK is also a major step, and it would have ramifications for any Royal Navy or Border Force vessel operating humanitarian missions in the Mediterranean, for example On seeking protection but entering illegally without a valid entry clearance becoming a new criminal offence, we must not send the message that somebody genuinely fleeing persecution whose only route out of that persecution is to the UK will automatically be seen as a criminal.",3
"We would end up with the system of international protection of refugees breaking down, as the UNHCR points out If the Bill passes, that is exactly what it means.",3
"Today, if a Uyghur, Syrian or persecuted Christian convert arrives in the UK to seek asylum, life will be far from plain sailing, precisely because of the outrageous waiting times, the dreadful asylum accommodation, the prohibition on work and the dreadful levels of financial support.",3
"They get here and, thanks to our amazing non-governmental organisations and charities, they slowly start to rebuild their lives But next year, if this Bill passes, for many of those Uyghurs, Syrians or persecuted Christian converts claiming asylum here, things will be infinitely bleaker, and that will be a deliberate policy choice of this Parliament.",3
Section 24 of the Immigration Act 1971 already punishes illegal entry by those without leave to enter.,3
"Sensibly, however, those who claim asylum on arrival are granted immigration bail, which does not count officially as entry.",3
"It would essentially criminalise the very act of arriving to claim asylum, because, as the explanatory notes acknowledge, the majority of asylum seekers will not have the ability to secure entry clearance.",3
"Today, the Uyghur, Syrian or persecuted Christian faces outrageous delays in asylum protection systems, and the Bill simply adds another six months Where will the Uyghur, Syrian or persecuted Christian be during that time—during that limbo—while the Home Office goes through the futile motions of seeking to remove them?",3
"Just now, for those who seek asylum we have a struggling, privatised, over-concentrated system of dispersed asylum accommodation.",3
"Under this Bill and this plan, that is not where the Home Secretary envisages the Syrian, the Uyghur or the persecuted Christian going.",3
"Instead, the grim future for these refugees appears under this Bill and this plan to be the disgraceful, disreputable open prison-like conditions that we have already witnessed at Napier or Penally Even worse, as we have heard, they may face being removed to an offshore centre to have their claim resolved.",3
Here is the real asylum shopping: the British Government grubbing around to find a country to palm off their responsibilities on to.,3
Let us think of the outrages and the lack of accountability we have seen in relation to immigration detention and the Napier open prison—the abuses that have been meted out there and the harm done.,3
"As we know from the Australian experiment, that will be as nothing compared to the hell that is likely to await at an offshore asylum facility.",3
"Having endured their limbo period, these three groups of refugees will finally have their case assessed by the Home Office.",3
"But instead of working to improve asylum decision making, the Bill seeks to make it harder for them to prove their case.",3
"It seeks to alter the long-established test set out in the refugee convention that the standard of proof required is a lower, but far from negligible, standard of real risk.",3
"That not only undermines the cautious approach in the convention, justified by the dangers that exist for asylum seekers, but pays no regard to just how difficult it is to prove events that happened in faraway countries In addition, by having two different standards of evidence in the same proceedings, it makes life harder for already struggling caseworkers.",3
"I find that deeply troubling, and it is clearly inconsistent with the refugee convention Let us imagine that the persecuted Christian, the Syrian and the Uyghur have survived their limbo period and made it through the asylum system, and the Home Office refusal of their application has been overturned on appeal.",3
"Because they have stopped temporarily in a European country, they are to be treated as a second-class refugee.",3
"Regardless of what any Minister says, that is absolutely contrary to the refugee convention and, more importantly, it is simply disgraceful.",3
"I draw the House’s attention to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests and the support that I have received—a research capacity in my office, relating to my work on asylum seekers, refugees and migrants—from the Refugee, Asylum and Migration Policy project When discussing immigration, asylum and our borders, there is a real problem with language and tone.",3
"But I always remembered that behind every visa application, every asylum claim and every journey to the shores of the UK there is a personal story—an individual.",3
Meeting people in detention centres—Syrian refugees who came here fleeing war or young people trying to regularise their status in order to complete their education—was both the toughest and the most rewarding part of the job I welcome my right hon.,3
Friend the Home Secretary’s reiterated commitment to a firm but fair immigration system.,3
There can be no question but that the issue of small boats making perilous crossings of the busiest shipping lane in the world is a challenging one.,3
"Friend will know as well as I do that once a craft has taken to the waters of the English channel, it is not only difficult to stop but potentially puts lives at risk, not only of asylum seekers but of our Border Force personnel.",2
Small boat crossings are not a problem that will be solved on the water.,3
I worry for their safety if attempts are made to turn boats around on the water I want to focus on the issue of support for those who seek to use safe and legal routes to claim asylum here.,3
That will be challenging to meet We have to be fair to those seeking asylum and fair to the taxpayer.,3
I was pleased to hear the borders Minister say in a Westminster Hall debate recently that there is to be a dramatic uplift in the number of those employed by the Home Office to process asylum claims.,3
I am worried that the new plan for immigration might place further burdens on them.,3
"The UK has been resettling approximately 5,000 a year over the past few years as a result of cross-party consensus to support Syrian refugees, but we have not yet heard a commitment.",3
"Safe Passage, which works with young people in need of family reunion, said that last year, under the Dublin scheme, all the young people it worked with on family reunion went through the legal system; they did not try to go with people traffickers or people smugglers through a dangerous route.",3
"This year, however, under the new system, a quarter of the children and young people it has worked with had given up in frustration, sought to try illegal routes and ended up in the hands of people smugglers or people traffickers as a result.",3
"The Government floated a range of impossible proposals: sending asylum seekers to be processed on Ascension Island or disused oil platforms or, most recently, sending them to Rwanda.",3
"When this country voted to take back control, clearly it had immigration in mind.",3
"At the moment, it looks as if we will probably have a labour shortage and may well need people with skills in certain areas to come in and keep a fast-recovering British economy going My constituents get very upset, however, when they watch television and see reports of people arriving on boats—something like 8,000.",3
"They think, “Can’t the Government do more?” We all know the problems of trying to deal with small boats in the channel.",3
"We have tried to co-operate with the French, who I understand are doing their best to stop the trade, but when people are arriving illegally daily and then, when we finally put them on a plane back to the country whence they arrived, human rights lawyers get involved, clearly we have a system that is not functional and is going to drive some of our constituents nuts In so far as the Bill gives us a vehicle for starting to deal with that, I think it can be welcomed.",3
"Friend the Member for Romsey and Southampton North (Caroline Nokes) is absolutely right that most people who are economic migrants come through two, three or four safe countries; maybe France is such a terrible place that the Government, tax rates and sunshine that we have in the United Kingdom and the English language are a great draw.",4
"The reality is that, as a responsible neighbour to some of the EU states, we have to take some of the refugees that the Italians, Greeks and Spanish get because of their proximity to north Africa and the middle east, and it would perhaps be better to do that in a planned and organised way than to allow illegal crossings of the channel.",3
My constituents will want to see the end of the rubber boats turning up in Sussex and Kent and perhaps a more streamlined and efficient system for dealing with these very important and complex problems.,3
"I rise to speak in broad support of the Bill, which offers a comprehensive reform of an asylum system that is broken and dysfunctional in part It is clear that a system is needed that is fair to those in genuine need but firmly against those who break the rules and the criminal gangs who seek to exploit some of the world’s most vulnerable and desperate people.",3
"Access to the UK’s asylum system should be based on need, not the ability to pay for people smugglers.",2
"All too often, it is they who gain, not the individuals who are being trafficked My constituents have been rightly enraged by the images of abandoned boats on the south coast and they have not been backwards in making their demands for change.",3
"Friend the Home Secretary’s determination to improve the UK’s position Imagine, for a moment, the lived experience of some of the people arriving on the UK’s shores by boat—a boat not fit for purpose and overpacked with families with a bursting need to leave their homes.",3
Such people sold most of what they owned to pay for a journey that is likely to be illegal from beginning to end and have paid what money they have gathered to criminals who care not a jot for their safety or whether they make their end destination.,3
This is rightly the cornerstone of our immigration policy.,2
"Continuing the resettlement of genuine refugees, family reunion and improving the reception processing system are welcome measures.",3
It is beyond time to reform our broken asylum system and replace it with one that is fair and offers a hand up for those in genuine need and targets those who seek to exploit some of the most vulnerable in the world.,2
"We welcome migrants, refugees and asylum seekers from around the world, and we will continue to do so: nothing in the Bill will change that People who enter the country legally will continue to be able to claim asylum here.",3
"We will continue to prioritise helping the most vulnerable: the elderly, children, and the poorest—those who are unable to travel hundreds of miles or to pay people smugglers, like the 25,000 people who have come here through our resettlement programme in the last six years.",3
"We have resettled more people through that programme than any other country in Europe People in genuine need deserve an asylum system that functions properly, supports them through the process, and makes a decision quickly.",3
"Nor do we want to continue with the system that is being exploited by people smugglers who callously treat human beings as if they were cargo, and sometimes not even as well as that.",2
"It will give Border Force additional powers to search, seize and divert vessels carrying people illegally, and it will provide an incentive for people to use safe and legal routes to claim asylum in the UK.",3
"This combination of measures will disrupt and undermine the business model of people smugglers It is important that we are able to keep all our citizens, our constituents, safe.",3
"There are currently 10,000 foreign national offenders outside prison in this country whom we need to deport.",2
"That is why I support the measures in the Bill that will end repeated, last-minute and vexatious legal challenges to deportation, expand the early removal scheme for removing foreign offenders from the UK as early as possible, and increase the sentence for breaching a deportation order from six months to five years This Bill will deliver an asylum system that continues to prioritise the most vulnerable, immediate indefinite leave to remain for refugees who are resettled through safe and legal routes, tougher sentences for people smugglers, and tougher sentences for foreign national offenders who try to come back to our country when they have no right to do so.",3
History is going to judge our Parliament and our Government harshly for introducing this piece of legislation at a time when there are unprecedented numbers of refugees around the world—the total figure globally is about 80 million.,3
"They are fleeing from war, poverty, injustice, human rights abuses and environmental disasters, and they are living in refugee camps in enormous numbers —in Bangladesh, where there are 1 million Rohingya people, and in Jordan, Lebanon and other countries across the middle east, including Libya.",3
"Those conditions are created by unfair trade and the arms that we sell, which bring about the wars that bring about the refugee flows.",2
"The number of refugees is likely to rise At a time when country after country is closing its borders to refugees, who are stuck for decades in refugee camps, our Government are joining the throng who stand against refugees, rather than for them.",3
"Instead of patting ourselves on the back for our historical good work in supporting refugees from some countries, we should recognise what is happening at the present time I took the opportunity to visit the refugee camp in Calais in 2015, for which the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, described me as preferring to spend a weekend hanging round with a “bunch of migrants”.",3
"The Bill will also create two tiers of asylum seekers: those who come through a moderately legitimate route by arriving in a port of entry and applying, and those who come out of desperation on leaking dinghies So what are we doing?",3
"Are we looking after the refugees or accusing them of wrongdoing for trying to get to a place of safety, and then condemning those who try to save them so that seafarers around the world who pluck refugees from the sea will be accused of illegally abetting migration to this country?",3
"Ten days ago, a Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboat took a group of people on a dinghy into a north Kent harbour to give them a place of safety.",3
"That would be contrary to the law of the sea, which requires it to save such lives I also ask the Government to look at the conditions in which refugees have to survive in this country, such as the disgusting conditions at Napier barracks, and at the number of refugees sleeping on our streets and begging to try to survive.",3
"Just think for a moment of what it is like to be a refugee trying to make a contribution to our world, and being criminalised in the process.",2
"We rely on refugees in hospitals, as doctors, as engineers, as teachers, as technicians and in so many other jobs in our society.",2
"The trend is continually up and the most recent figures show that 700,000 migrants arrived in the UK in the year ending March 2020.",3
"This is simply unsustainable For the past 50 years, the Conservative manifesto has always referenced controlling immigration.",3
"Immigration puts pressure on our schools, the NHS and housing, while also challenging our identity and values when it is not properly controlled and when new arrivals do not integrate within their new communities.",2
"The British people can see this and understand this, and they have demanded action for at least the past two decades The vote to leave the EU was, among other things, a vote to take back control of our borders and to control immigration.",4
"Of course, that is not to say that immigration does not bring benefits to the UK, but the over-supply of low-skilled labour has had severe consequences, suppressing wages and reducing the number of entry-level jobs available.",3
I am so pleased we have a Home Secretary who is willing to discuss these issues and face up to the problems that large-scale immigration is causing.,3
"Successive Governments have been far too reluctant to do so, perhaps through fear of facing the cancel culture of the woke brigade The element that is most emotive and that angers my constituents more than any other is illegal immigration—specifically, the thousands of small boats arriving on the south coast.",3
"It is high time this Bill was brought forward to tackle the scourge of illegal immigration, and I strongly welcome the measures outlined within it.",3
"Giving our Border Force additional powers to turn around boats crossing the channel, making it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission and introducing life sentences for people smugglers will all reduce the number of migrants making the unnecessary and illegal crossing in small boats However, some will still make the perilous journey.",3
"The task of processing asylum claims must be made quicker and, for those who are rejected, we must be far more robust in deporting them from the UK.",3
"Over the past 15 years, around three quarters of applicants who were refused asylum have lodged an appeal.",3
"Their vexatious and often last-minute appeals—submitted and encouraged by left-wing human rights lawyers—are done at tremendous cost to the UK taxpayer, and it is encouraging that this Bill will overhaul the legal system for asylum claims, finally putting an end to this utter nonsense.",3
"If people have no right to be here, they should be swiftly deported—it is as simple as that Those on the Opposition Benches, including the Leader of the Opposition, have previously stood on election promises to reintroduce the free movement of people, showing just how out of touch they are with traditional Labour voters.",3
"On this side of the House, however, we are building a system that is fair for the British people and reforms our broken asylum system, and this Bill is one I wholeheartedly support.",3
"This is happening here in our land and across the English channel—death, violence, sex trafficking, exploitation, bribery, guns, drugs, modern slavery, and illegal migration.",2
Let us make no mistake: this is the reality of the small boats crisis.,2
Persons with criminal intent have been identified coming into Dover in boats picked up in the channel.,3
"Any local person knows about the very many boats that do make it onto the land, onto the beaches and onto our shores in the coastal villages of Kingsdown, St Margaret’s and Walmer and further afield.",3
"That is why, for our national security, we must have strong borders and bring an end to the small boats crossing route Today’s measures are not about a lack of compassion.",3
They are about recognising that there is no compassion in allowing this illegal activity to continue.,3
"Today’s Bill, alongside its sister immigration reform Bill, provides more powers to strengthen our borders and more options to work with other countries to make sure that people are encouraged to use legal and safe routes and discouraged from using these dangerous and illegal ones The bottom line is this: it is only when migrants and traffickers alike know that they cannot break into Britain in this way that the small boats crossing route will come to an end.",3
It is crucial that we restore trust in our immigration system.,2
"Our asylum system is in desperate need of reform and our constituents rightly expect it to be fixed In only the past year, 16,000 people have entered the country illegally, and those are just the ones we know about.",2
"That also creates a severe backlog, which delays the processing of genuine asylum cases and slows down our judicial processes Most worryingly, there are now 10,000 foreign national offenders in circulation outside prisons in the UK whom the Home Office are intent on deporting but cannot because of legal barriers.",3
I welcome the fact that the Government’s new plan for immigration will speed up the removal of these dangerous foreign criminals.,3
"Any foreign national who comes to this country and abuses our hospitality by breaking the law should be in no doubt of the UK Government’s determination to deport them When assessing the needs of individual asylum claimants, knowing the age of applicants is really important for ensuring that children get protected and properly looked after.",3
"As a doctor, I have participated in the past in the assessment of asylum-seeking children, and the current system in place is nowhere near accurate enough for making such crucial and important decisions.",3
"One of my constituents, who has served this country on military operations, was shocked to discover that he was unable to get British citizenship for his son, despite the fact that he is British and the son was born in Britain.",4
"This is because his European mother was still legally married to a foreign national at the time of their son’s birth, and under the current legislation a child’s father is legally deemed to be the husband at the time the woman gives birth.",4
"However, in this particular case my constituent is the father in all biological, emotional and practical terms New measures in the Bill will provide an entitlement to British citizenship for people who were previously unable to acquire it because their mother was married to someone other than their biological father at the time of birth.",3
"I am pleased to have the chance to speak in this debate, although I regret the fact that the time limit means my comments will be brief This important Bill aims to provide a fair and safe asylum system and give greater rights and protections to those who have legally sought asylum in the UK.",3
"It seeks properly to control our borders and thereby strengthen our national security, and it will clamp down on some of the most despicable criminals: the gangs who make money from people smuggling and modern slavery.",3
We all remember the tragic deaths of migrants who have paid smugglers to cram them into lorries without sufficient ventilation.,3
"We have seen people with no sailing experience who have paid to be piled into unseaworthy vessels—often nothing more than a dinghy—and then pushed offshore to make a dangerous and, tragically, often deadly sea crossing.",3
"Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May) said, many who seek to come to the UK by illegal routes are economic migrants.",3
"If I had more time, I would speak about the work that the UK is doing in trade and education, and the work that we should do to help developing countries to really develop, so that people all over the world can have prosperous, fulfilling lives for themselves and their families I was deeply disappointed by the shadow Home Secretary’s remarks about the Bill creating a more discriminatory asylum system, because by not supporting measures in the Bill he would allow the current system to continue.",3
"He must surely look at the current system and see the clear discrimination against older people, disabled people, women and children—against anyone unable or less able to make long, arduous, dangerous journeys As I have only a few more seconds, I conclude by saying that we should all want a fair and just asylum system, and such a system does not say that if people are young enough, fit enough or brave enough, they can get ahead and jump the queue.",3
A fair and just asylum system does not reward organised gangs of criminals for putting vulnerable people’s lives at risk.,2
A fair and just asylum system is not this perverse and deadly real-life “Hunger Games”.,2
I hope you are enjoying the view—congratulations I sometimes wonder whether the Home Secretary or her cheerleaders on the Government Benches have ever actually met an asylum seeker.,3
"If the asylum seekers who come to my surgeries in Glasgow North find it stressful, embarrassing or upsetting to have to carry a biometric ID card that states that they have no right to work when, being a human being, they are born with that right, or that they have no recourse to public funds, it is no less humiliating to have to explain from the other side of the surgery table why the Government are so unremittingly hostile to their presence in this country It is easy to stand at the Dispatch Box or on the Back Benches and say that these people should leave the UK; try looking them in the eyes—eyes that have seen horrors that some of us cannot even imagine—and saying that.",3
"I defy any Minister or any Tory Back Bencher to come to the next meeting of the Maryhill Integration Network Voices group, listen to the testimonies of the men and women who take part and then come back to this House and justify the policies that they are promoting today For 20 years the Maryhill Integration Network has supported asylum seekers and refugees in the north of Glasgow, welcoming them into the community, and helping to share experiences, culture, food and joy across the entire city.",3
"Rema was a refugee—she was a journalist in Kosovo—who fled to a refugee camp in Macedonia with her family, before being evacuated to Glasgow for health reasons.",3
"How many will be put up in barracks before being deported, and criminalised on the moment of arrival, because of course they had to struggle to get here—their oppressive regime did not give them a passport and a ticket to the airport Hostility is the hallmark of this Government: hostility to devolution, hostility to the aid budget, and now a supercharging of the hostile environment for refugees and asylum seekers.",3
"The visa system is in at least as much of a mess as the asylum system, and it amounts to one message: global Britain is closed.",2
"In time, Scotland will have its own immigration system, and just as Scots have been welcomed and made their homes in countries around the world, we will welcome travellers, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, respecting their human rights and our humanitarian responsibilities.",4
"I say this to refugee and asylum-seeking constituents in Glasgow North: no matter what you hear from the Tory Dispatch Box today, you are welcome in Glasgow, you are welcome in Scotland, we want you to be safe, and we want you to stay.",3
I was elected in 2019 on a manifesto that promised to reform our immigration system.,3
"For too long, excessive and uncontrolled immigration, and abuses of our asylum system, have allowed people to get around the rules without much prospect of ever being removed once they are here.",2
"It provides the powers we need to remove people who should not be here, and to discourage anyone who would try to cross into the country illegally.",2
"The message is simple: if you come here illegally by irregular means, you will not be staying The Bill has three main objectives: first, to increase the fairness of the system better to protect and support those in need of asylum; secondly, to deter illegal entry into the United Kingdom, thereby breaking people smuggling networks and protecting the lives of those they endanger; and thirdly, to remove more easily those with no right to be in the UK.",3
"They are also what the public want us to do Whenever I am out and about in Hyndburn and Haslingden, I hear concerns from residents about controlling our borders and cracking down on illegal immigration.",3
"There is a proper asylum route into this country, and it is important that people realise they will be punished if they do not follow it.",2
"The Bill will not only deter those people who get in boats to make illegal crossings, but it will smash the networks that bring them here.",3
"We need an asylum system that is compassionate towards people who apply to come here, processes claims efficiently and effectively, and quickly removes anyone who is not successful in their application.",2
"The Bill delivers on all that The Bill will broaden criminal sanctions for offences related to illegal entry or bringing people here illegally, and it will increase the maximum penalties for both.",3
It will also give border and immigration staff additional powers to stop and redirect vessels out of UK territorial waters.,3
"The Bill is an important step in creating a new immigration system, based on merit, which controls who, when, and how people can come here, and cuts immigration overall.",3
"It gives my constituents confidence that the Government have heard their concerns on immigration, and are working to tackle them.",3
"I will feed that back to them when I get back to Ashfield this weekend We have always been a welcoming and tolerant country that has reached out to genuine refugees from all over the world, but just like Janis’s family in Ashfield, most people in the UK do not accept that people travelling here from France in dinghies are genuine asylum seekers—[Interruption.]",4
They are not genuine asylum seekers.,2
We know that many of them have been trafficked with a clear instruction on how to claim asylum once they get here.,3
"That is because our asylum system is not fit for purpose, and this Bill stops that The Labour party and the Opposition want to bring back free movement.",3
"They dislike our points-based immigration system, and now they are going to vote against a Bill that protects our borders and helps us deport foreign murderers and rapists.",3
"This new Bill will ensure that people in genuine need, like Janis all those years ago, get the help they need, and the greedy lawyers and the human traffickers will be told, “No more.” We owe it to people such as Janis who are suffering today to ensure that we have a fairer system that offers genuine refugees a safe haven.",3
"We are getting tough on crime, we are getting tough on immigration and we are getting tough on law and order.",3
"Friend the Home Secretary, an adopted Stokie, is right to say that our asylum system is broken.",3
"People in Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke will see images of people crossing the channel illegally in small boats and are rightly infuriated, because they know the impact that illegal immigration has.",3
"In Stoke-on-Trent, we have done more than almost any other area in giving asylum seekers a home.",3
"At the end of 2020, we had the fifth highest rate of asylum seekers per 10,000 of population in the whole UK, housing more than 1,000 asylum seekers.",3
"That means that one in every 250 people living in Stoke is now an asylum seeker, and with the certainty of even more illegal entries into the UK on boats, in lorries or through those arriving without visas, places such as Stoke-on-Trent will be pushed to their limit.",3
"Services such as our local NHS and schools are under strain and being stretched even further, and I fully support the decision by Stoke-on-Trent City Council’s leader, Councillor Abi Brown, to pause our involvement with the asylum dispersal scheme.",3
"It is a safe country, but these asylum seekers are travelling from war-torn countries where their lives are in danger “We cannot close the door and instead we need to call out this policy for what it is—xenophobic populism which exploits people’s fears of the outsider.” Those are not my words, but the words of Susan Brown, a leading member of the Church of Scotland and honorary chaplain to the Queen in Scotland, after seeing the consultation paper on the Bill.",3
"Susan clearly does not believe in myths, such as that immigrants are a drain on the NHS and the benefits system or that they bring increases in violent crime with them.",3
"For her, this is about being the kind of people we would want to be, treating others as we would hope they would treat us and our families were the roles reversed Some may argue that strict immigration policies are necessary to protect our borders and our country from the effects of immigration.",3
"Immigration is a necessary part of the British way of life On healthcare, the demand among migrants to the UK is lower than among the UK-born population, except among in-patients for childbirth.",3
"In Scotland, migrants from outside the UK are in general young and have low healthcare needs.",2
"On benefits, foreign-born people are less likely to receive key Department for Work and Pensions out-of-work benefits than UK-born people.",3
"On crime, in Scotland, statistics for individual crime participation tend to show that migrants are less likely to commit crime than observably similar people who were born in the United Kingdom I return to Susan Brown of the Church of Scotland, who said: “What we need is political leadership which acknowledges and allays people’s concerns and promotes the importance of human life and dignity…This means giving asylum seekers the right to work…Establishing safe passage routes or humanitarian corridors to the UK for those that need sanctuary…and…support for individuals to alleviate destitution and poverty.” In conclusion, I urge the Government to seriously reconsider many aspects of the Bill and to adopt a more appropriate economic and humanitarian approach to nationality and immigration.",3
I welcome you to your elevated position Many of my constituents in Stoke-on-Trent South are shocked and angered by the illegal crossings of the English channel.,3
"The integrity of our borders is broken, and my constituents are fed up of seeing people continue to enter the UK illegally.",2
"We must act to put an end to the profiteering of criminal people traffickers, for whom illegal routes have become an industry, and we must deter those who seek to make these perilous journeys across the busiest shipping lane in the world in no more than a rubber dinghy Clearly, there must be safe routes for those in desperate need.",3
"The UK and Stoke-on-Trent have a proud record of helping those in the greatest need, but what my constituents cannot understand is why there should be any need to make illegal journeys to do so: European countries are safe, and those attempting to claim asylum should do so in those countries We have seen repeated attempts to game the system, using any legal loophole to do so.",3
"There were 16,000 illegal immigrants last year yet, because the system is overwhelmed and repeatedly abused, deportations are declining.",2
The increased pressures we have seen on the entire immigration system put enormous weight on the few asylum dispersal areas.,3
Stoke-on-Trent has seen one of the highest proportions of refugees in the entire country.,3
"Labour’s overhaul of Britain’s immigration policies took average net entry into the country from between 10,000 and 20,000 a year, to between 200,000 and 300,000 a year.",3
"From then on, the mere claim of asylum was sufficient to be allowed to stay in the country That was when Labour and the media created a toxic atmosphere in which merely mentioning “immigration” branded a person racist, so any expression of fact about immigration was made impossible.",3
"From ’97, Labour legally wove into the very fabric of society something akin to a culture war against the British people and their mainstream values—the same people who value fairness, generosity and compassion for true asylum seekers, and who want a fair immigration system.",3
"And yes, equally, true asylum seekers have been failed Labour’s legacy is clear, if just from the numbers.",3
"My voters in Dudley have made that very clear to me People smugglers have benefited from the UK magnet, and the system has helped migrants become prey to them, putting their lives in danger.",3
Extensive work is taking place in this area I was about to speak about our proposals to address the illegal side of migration.,3
"Illegal migration causes real harm and endangers the lives of those undertaking many dangerous and perilous journeys, more often than not in the hands of smugglers and people traffickers.",2
The number of people crossing the English channel in small boats reached record levels last summer.,3
People smugglers trade in human misery.,2
"Not only do these gangs exploit and hurt desperate people, but they are responsible for other illicit activities ranging from drugs and firearms trafficking to serious violent crime.",2
They must be brought to task The House will recall that earlier this year I launched our new plan for immigration.,3
It is underpinned by the principle that access to the UK’s asylum system should be based on need and not on the ability to pay people smugglers.,3
It will better protect those in need of genuine asylum.,3
"It will deter illegal entry into the UK, break the business model of criminal traffickers and their networks, and save lives.",3
"It will also make it easier to remove people with no right to be in the country, including dangerous foreign criminals Those who come to the UK legally to work hard and contribute to our national life will always be welcome, but those who abuse that welcome by committing crimes will be deported.",3
"So far this year, more than 650 foreign national offenders have been removed from the UK; that means fewer foreign murderers, rapists and drug dealers on our streets.",3
That very much speaks to the fact that the current system is not fit for purpose and justice is being delayed for those with genuine and important asylum claims.,3
Judicial and court resources are overstretched and our new plan for immigration will address that The Bill will ensure that the system does not reward those who enter the UK illegally and through those appalling illicit means.,3
"Those who have travelled through a safe country where they could reasonably have claimed asylum, such as France or Belgium, are now inadmissible in the UK asylum system.",4
"For the first time, whether people enter the UK legally or illegally will have an impact on how their asylum claim is progressed, and on their status in the UK if their claim is successful.",3
"We will create a new and expanded one-stop-shop process so that asylum, human rights and any other protection claims are made and considered up front at the beginning of the process, ending the cycle of limitless appeals in our courts As I have made clear, the Government will do whatever it takes to protect the public, and that also applies to our national security.",3
Legislation will also include the creation of a foreign influence registration scheme.,3
"They want us to take back our country’s borders, and we are delivering on that.",3
"That means supporting our police and others whose job it is to keep us safe, defeating the criminals and criminal gangs, securing our borders and removing those with no right to be here, protecting our national security, and taking the strongest possible action against those who wish to harm us.",3
"We will look at this long-delayed legislation closely, and seek to work constructively to bring about the changes needed to guard against not just the threats of today, but the fast-emerging global threats to our democracy As we look at the UK’s role in the world, I want to turn to the new plan for immigration.",3
"I do not disagree that the asylum system is too slow: the reason for that is the Conservative party, which has run the immigration system for the past 11 years.",2
The share of asylum applications that received an initial decision within six months fell from 87% in 2014 to 20% in 2019.,3
"There has been a huge surge in the number of dangerous crossings in small boats from France, but where is the comprehensive deal with France to deal with it?",3
"That is not the way to tackle the issue or the heinous crime of people trafficking At the same time, we have seen people housed in overcrowded accommodation that represented a fundamental failure of leadership and planning at the Home Office, leading to a dangerous covid outbreak and putting vulnerable people, staff and neighbouring communities at risk From what we have seen of the plans so far, they will do next to nothing to stop people making crossings.",3
"They risk withdrawing support from vulnerable people, including victims of human trafficking.",3
"Yet again, Conservative failure will be hard-wired into the system On the issue of borders, the lax measures against covid have been frankly negligent.",3
"The Government were late to introduce formal quarantining, they failed to have an effective home quarantining system, and they were late to introduce border testing and hotel quarantining —and even then, only 1% of arrivals actually stayed in hotels Like everyone across the House, I am deeply worried by the sharp increase in the covid variant cases in Bolton, Blackburn, Darwen and other parts of the country.",3
We have been warning the Government for months of the reckless risks they have been taking with their half-baked border measures.,3
"The Home Secretary shakes her head, but she has been on video making clear her disagreement with the Government’s approach to the borders.",3
"The Prime Minister has serious questions to answer about the suggestions that he delayed adding India to the red list because of the planned visit Ministers must learn the lessons, act more cautiously now on the reopening of international travel, and make their border protections effective.",3
"At the same time, violence has been on the rise, affecting all our communities; neighbourhood policing has been cut to the bone; our democracy has been left vulnerable to hostile state action; and we have an immigration system devoid of compassion and competence What we needed was a bold vision for security in our country and safety on our streets.",3
"It includes rolling back the power of our courts to halt unlawful Government action, a clampdown on protest, ripping up the refugee convention and measures tantamount to voter suppression Yet when it comes to the big problems that we need to address to keep people safe, key questions are completely ducked.",3
"If the Home Office has listened and learned from those events, it will undertake no immigration enforcement activity in Glasgow without the express and advance knowledge of Police Scotland.",3
"I refer to the refugee convention, which is approaching its 70th birthday, and the Misuse of Drugs Act, which is approach its 50th.",3
"First, on the Bill that will trash the refugee convention—what a contrast with the cross-party legislation that saw refugees voting in the Scottish Parliament election a little over a week ago—the Home Secretary seems determined to ride a coach and horses through long-established principles of international refugee law that have stood the test of time.",3
"She wants to raise the standard of proof required of asylum seekers above that set out in the convention, despite the incredible challenges of evidencing persecution in the country the asylum seeker has had to flee Instead of being granted refugee status, those accepted as being at risk of persecution will face a life in limbo for up to 10 years, with family reunion rights restricted, and will be left to languish without recourse to public funds.",3
"She put people at risk and hundreds fell ill, but far from being apologetic, she appears to be doubling down The Home Secretary talks about clamping down on people smugglers, but the proposals have nothing to do with people smugglers.",3
"This is clamping down on refugees themselves and punishing victims of persecution because of how they arrived in the UK, making an example of them, making them miserable and ruining their life chances in an attempt to discourage others from following.",3
"If every Government took the same pass-the-buck approach as this one, the international system of refugee protection would break down entirely.",3
"If not, please stop talking about Britain’s proud history of welcoming refugees, because she will have trashed that history, along with the refugee convention.",3
Nor is it policy that reflects the values or interests of this country; it is head-in-the-sand policy that helps only the drugs pushers and people smugglers.,3
I want to focus on one aspect of the Home Office measures: the much needed overhaul of the immigration and asylum system.,3
I very much welcome the Home Secretary’s recent new plan for immigration.,3
"I have spoken about this before, because all we need, above all, is an immigration system that is fair, fast, flexible, family friendly and beneficial to the UK and to the many people escaping danger and persecution overseas.",2
"We have a proud record of helping and encouraging those who want to make a big contribution to the UK, but too often our immigration system is bureaucratic and complicated, as the Windrush situation showed.",3
I welcome the Home Secretary’s comment that if someone comes by an illegal route they are not treated on a par with someone who has applied legitimately and through legal means such as refugee agencies and refugee camps.,3
"In return, we need an immigration system that is streamlined, affordable —not a revenue generator for the Home Office—and works quickly to get people to a place of safety sustainably and deals with those who do not have a future in the UK.",3
"I think this is a trade-off that gains the support of the public I specifically ask the Home Secretary to look at the plight of a group of young migrants who have come to Britain, represented by the excellent We Belong organisation, who find themselves in limbo: no fewer than 332,000 children and young people growing up legally in the UK without any formal immigration status who migrated here as children predominantly from Commonwealth countries and know only the UK as their home.",3
"They came here with their families and their immigration status has not been settled, which becomes a problem when they reach adulthood and want to go to university or get a job.",2
I hope that in the immigration legislation coming forward we can give them the settlement and surety that they deserve.,3
"More needs to be done to tackle the people trafficking gangs that exploit migrants across Europe, promising to get them to this country.",3
"Does the Prime Minister agree that it is totally unacceptable that companies such as Facebook allow those smugglers to offer their services on their platforms—not only routes into the country, but the sale of forged British papers in order to aid their access?",3
Does he agree that when this House passes the Online Safety Bill we will have the power to do more to make companies such as Facebook take down content that promotes illegal activity?,3
"If they accepted a passport or an ID card from an EEA national for right to work or right to rent checks in England, they do not need, as of today, to start going back through the process to see who has EUSS status and who does not None the less, we have been looking at our systems and seeing how people use them.",4
"For example, the view and prove service allows users to view their immigration status online.",3
"Between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2021, the service had seen more than 3.9 million views by individuals and more than 330,000 views by organisations checking immigration status.",3
"Many of those with status under the British National (Overseas) visa, which we created as a settlement route for those in Hong Kong, also rely on purely digital status.",3
"In virtually all cases, it is because the applicant either has pending prosecutions, which means that a decision cannot be made until that criminal justice matter is resolved, or has been referred for consideration of deportation action in relation to criminal justice matters and criminal records When it comes to communicating, we have so far invested nearly £8 million in public communications about the EUSS to encourage EU citizens who are eligible for the scheme, and their family members, to apply.",3
"That includes victims of human trafficking or domestic abuse, those with severe mental health conditions, those without a permanent address and those who are elderly or isolated.",3
It would seem a bit weird to put that in the immigration status.,3
"We recognise that not every area or community has a postal collection beyond 9 am, and it would produce some quite harsh outcomes if we required people to take a selfie of themselves posting something at 5 o’clock in the evening Touching on the point around pregnancy, we have already changed nationality law to provide for a grant of British citizenship when a child is born to someone who subsequently secures settled status based on a late application.",3
"It is important that anyone who has not applied to the scheme does so, to ensure that their payments do not stop, but we would reassure them that help in applying remains available, including through our grant funded network Finally, in this area, if somebody who may be eligible for the scheme but has not made an application is encountered by immigration enforcement, they will be given another opportunity to apply.",3
"While a debate on the EUSS, and this time for Members to reflect on the millions of applications it has received and statuses granted, is very welcome, the final line of the motion points to the ultimate goal of those who sit on the separatist Benches: a border for people between England and Scotland We always see that presented as just a chance to give Scotland’s employers an opportunity to recruit at the minimum wage on a European or perhaps even global basis, rather than offering the rewarding packages that many of Scotland’s key workers deserve—or perhaps as a way to avoid dealing with the underlying issues that drive people to abandon the world-famous natural beauty of the Scottish highlands and islands to find opportunities for work elsewhere.",3
"Should immigration policy really be the go-to option for roles where the work-based training requirements can be completed in a shorter time Similarly, it is a depressing vision for the future of Scotland—or some of its most beautiful parts—to suggest creating a system that makes the main attraction or selling point of a future Scotland not better prospects, higher skills and being at the cutting edge of scientific research, but the fact that it is a place where someone will need to spend a few years before qualifying for indefinite leave to remain, which will then allow them to move elsewhere As we know, for every problem, the SNP believes a border with England is the answer.",3
"Our approach is clear: to create a migration system that is not focused on the politics of division and separatism, or where someone’s passport is from, but judges people by their skills and what they have to offer, and has at its core a vision of a higher-wage, higher-skill, higher-prosperity Scotland, delivered by being part of our United Kingdom—a Union greater than the sum of its parts That means that our focus is to deliver an immigration system that works for Scotland’s workers, universities, businesses, events and future economic growth.",3
"It can never be a magic bullet for issues and problems that are the responsibility of Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government, much as we wish it could be, but Scotland’s interests have been at the heart of each stage of recent changes Those changes include setting the general salary threshold for our key economic migration route within £20 of the Scottish median salary; harmonising the rules for settlement with the requirements for the skilled worker visa to encourage those who have come to work here to stay here for good; reform of the permit-free festival system to move towards a more proportionate approach; allowing short-term study via the visitor route; simplifying processes and expanding opportunity; changes to the student route in support of the ambitions of Scotland’s universities; removing the need to apply for ATAS—academic technology approval scheme—permission for our closest allies when studying relevant courses; broadening the skills threshold to reflect not just academically focused careers; allowing permitted paid engagement leave via entry through Ireland, removing the need for a Dublin band to fly via Paris to do a gig in Glasgow; and, over the coming year, introducing biometric reuse on more routes to reduce the need to travel to a service centre when applying for further leave to remain All those things have been driven by direct engagement with Scotland and its businesses, universities and community groups.",3
"They make Britain great, and we will never apologise for standing up for the rights of those who choose to call this country their home The immigration system that this Government have created over the past 11 years is broken, and surely the Minister could see, when he reeled off the list of things that the Home Office has been doing with regard to immigration, that the fact that the SNP has tabled a motion to devolve immigration and create that border is the result of some of the things that the Home Office has done over the past 11 years.",3
"Demonising people who have contributed, or want to contribute, so much to our country has provided a level of distrust in the system that has meant that EU nationals feel uncertain about their future It is also very counterproductive, as we have already seen in the impact of the Government’s immigration policies, especially in key sectors at the forefront of the fight against coronavirus.",3
"Hospitality businesses are struggling to find enough staff; even the famous Tim Martin, founder of JD Wetherspoon, broke the irony meter last week when he called on the Government to introduce a new EU migrant visa for the hospitality sector And, of course, migration works both ways, with more than 1 million UK citizens choosing to make another European country their home.",3
"We have heard about some processes put in place, such as the reasonable excuse test, but I hope that we will not see convoys of immigration control vans heading down our streets to deport EU nationals.",3
"It is disappointing that the SNP has decided to use the motion as a clarion call for a border at Berwick, rather than for a debate to stand up for and help our EU friends and family with regard to the settlement scheme.",3
It is a real missed opportunity The motion makes reference to the SNP’s desire for a separate Scottish immigration system.,3
What such a system will indisputably need is a border at Berwick.,3
"Any system of differing migration ultimately requires a border between the two countries with different systems, and we know that is the SNP’s desire.",3
"When we are debating the consequences for individuals of putting up a border between the UK and the EU, the SNP’s solution is to put up a border between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom—or, as some SNP MSPs famously called it, a border job creation scheme.",3
"They have even threatened the constitutional position of the monarch, with their underhand attempt at an illegal Prorogation of Parliament.",3
"Last week, the chair of the official Committee on Standards in Public Life said: “It is essential … that parties obtain funding in ways that are free from suspicion that donors receive favours or improper influence in return … I doubt many would argue that our current system meets this test.” That was a masterclass in understatement Yet, far from achieving cross-party and independent consensus on how to achieve transparency and safeguards, the Government’s Elections Bill actually increases the chance of elusive foreign financial inducements.",3
I pointed out then that progressing to elections a century after they had first been envisaged in the Parliament Act 1911 could only be considered “hurried” in this Chamber.,3
"However, marine historians remind us that at least 10% of the crews in Nelson’s fleet were not English; they were foreigners.",3

"It is London, Washington, the UN in New York or Port Louis that is seeking to decide their future sovereign status However, there is another injustice that has been suffered by descendants of Chagos islanders: the denial of their moral rights to British overseas territory citizenship.",3
"It is no fault of the grandchildren and other descendants of the Chagos islanders that their forebears were forcibly removed from their homeland and essentially dumped in other parts of the Indian ocean, but it has meant that they have lost their rights to British overseas territory citizenship.",3
"Had those individuals been born in other overseas territories, such as Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands or Bermuda, they would have a right to British overseas territory citizenship.",4
"This is causing great hardship for many families, and dividing many communities as a result Those who were born on the Chagos islands and the direct children of those born on the Chagos islands do have a right to British overseas territory citizenship and therefore British citizenship.",4
"However, many grandchildren and other descendants of those islanders are technically seen as foreign nationals, and have to go through an expensive and rigorous visa process to be here, and then apply for indefinite leave to remain.",3
"That results in families with different nationality status and immigration status, often in the same household.",3
We have heard a lot about over 3 million BNO—British national overseas—citizens in Hong Kong with a potential right to settle in this country as a result of the increasing Chinese erosion of democracy there.,4
"On the Government’s watch, people are being prevented from accessing the immigration system, and that leads to exclusion and isolation for the children and young people who are denied citizenship due to the barriers in their way Citizenship should not be about cost; it should be about contributing to our communities and inclusivity, but under the current system, it is about cost.",3
"Member for Ashford (Damian Green) and others, relates to the British national overseas visa scheme.",3
"As we know, the BNO scheme was, in theory, designed to offer a path to citizenship for Hongkongers, but in practice the scheme is not working as well as it could.",3
"That is particularly true for younger Hongkongers who have fled the country over fear of repercussions, as those born after 1997 do not hold BNO passports, and are therefore unable to settle in the UK via the BNO route.",3
"The result of this loophole in the BNO scheme is that young people who have fled police brutality find themselves fighting for their rights within the sclerotic and inefficient UK asylum system, having been arbitrarily excluded from the scheme because of their age Hongkongers born after 1997 do not hold a BNO passport.",3
"Home Office figures show that there were 124 asylum claims from Hong Kong nationals in the year to June 2021, compared with 21 the year before and just nine in the year to June 2019.",3
"As I have said on other amendments and new clauses, despite our deep concerns about the Bill’s draconian, dog-whistle politics when it comes to refugees and asylum seekers, it provides an opportunity to right wrongs in our system.",3
We support the efforts to correct some historical injustices of UK nationality law and bringing British citizenship and British overseas territories citizenship law back into line.,3
"However, there are a number of issues that I want to raise and I will start with the SNP’s new clauses New clause 34 would ensure that the Government do not profit from people registering as British citizens or British overseas citizens.",3
He came here as an asylum seeker and got his refugee status.,3
"To do that, he needed the protection of a British passport and British citizenship, so he set about applying.",3
"I know that nobody in this Chamber would have wanted what happened to him to have happened—I am coming to that—but I want to explain the impact of these extortionate fees in the hope that the Government can be persuaded to reduce them It took Cambull a long time, but he did finally get back to Sudan, with his British passport, to see what had become of his family, and he discovered that his mum had, in fact, survived the brutal attacks.",3
"As I have said, I am not for a second suggesting that anybody here or anybody drafting the legislation would not care about what happened to Cambull, but if he had been able to apply for his citizenship when he became eligible—in other words, if he had been able to afford the cost because it was the actual cost, rather than the cost plus profit—he could have been reunited with his mum before she passed away, and it would have meant so much to both of them.",3
"I would also like an assurance from the Minister that awareness raising will apply equally to British citizenship and British overseas territories citizenship On new clause 33, EU citizens have been living in the UK without knowing that, for some, there is an obscure requirement to hold a form of private health insurance.",3
"New clause 33 is necessary because, for many, this requirement has only become apparent when applying for citizenship or when applying for British passports for their children born in the UK, and it is now presenting significant hurdles to obtaining citizenship.",3
"Rather than ease the process and reform the current system to help children attain citizenship, the Government are intent on putting up more barriers and making it more difficult for children under 18 to be registered.",3
"We are very much opposed to clause 9, which, as we have heard, grants the Home Secretary the power to strip UK nationals of their citizenship in secret and without advance warning.",3
"As we approach Christmas and we are thinking about families and home, with all the disadvantages that children in care face, the Government seem all too at ease with telling these children that they have no country to call home unless their local authority is willing to pay for it I spoke to children who were Lambeth care leavers and they told me horrific tales of threats of deportation to countries they have never been to because they cannot prove their link to their citizenship due to issues with their relations with their parents.",3
"Our cash-strapped local authorities cannot afford to keep paying these fees, and they are not border guards or immigration specialists who understand exactly what is happening The hon.",3
"Member for Glasgow North East (Anne McLaughlin) is absolutely right that there are parts of the citizenship section of the Bill that we appreciate, and things have been corrected.",3
"I rise to speak to new clause 7, which is in my name, and has been kindly supported by Members from eight different parties, including immigration and NHS subject experts, for which I am exceedingly grateful.",3
"I would like to declare an interest: my partner is an NHS clinician from overseas, but this new clause would not benefit him as he already has his permanent residency status confirmed In this country, we typically use the word “hero” far too casually; it is lavished on our celebrities and sports stars, but, while I am sure they are very deserving, this pandemic has shown us who this country’s true heroes are—our NHS workforce.",3
"Regardless of their or our citizenship, the duty and responsibility to care and contribute to the wellbeing of others always comes first with them Although I welcome the many steps that the Government have taken already for foreign NHS workers, we need to go further, and I ask the Minister to give this some serious consideration for support this afternoon.",3
"With fees for indefinite leave to remain at almost £2,400 and citizenship applications at another £1,330, the total cost of naturalisation is almost £4,000—one of the highest fees of its type in the world, and that is after a minimum of five years, in which there will also have been an initial visa cost, another high fee to be renewed every third anniversary.",3
It took another year for her husband and daughter to join her because of the costs involved in dependants’ visas.,3
"They could only get to be together as a family once more by taking a loan, which she has to pay for over three years Three years after she arrived—so with still one more year of loan payments to go—she had to get another loan and compound her cash flow problems because she was due for visa renewal, and so had a load more fees.",3
"Arguably, by saving our lives and keeping us safe, our NHS workers have given the biggest contribution of all Despite being such valued members of the communities in which they live and work, without ILR and citizenship, individuals cannot be fully part of them.",3
"Scrapping the fees would not only make ILR more affordable and a viable option for foreign workers in our NHS, but create a more diverse and, crucially, more integrated society.",3
"A few weeks ago, I had a message from my partner, who was distressed at having met a new patient that morning who said, “I hope you’re not from Myanmar.” We have a long way still to go with integration and acceptance People from other countries who have worked in the NHS during the pandemic and throughout their lives deserve to be able to call the UK home, and actually feel like it is.",4
"I also rise to speak in support of amendment 12 Citizenship is a fundamental right that speaks to our very sense of belonging and identity, which is why it is enshrined not just in law but in the UN charter, the universal declaration of human rights and the 1954 convention relating to the status of stateless persons Under this Home Secretary, the Government have failed to treat citizenship with the reverence and respect it deserves.",3
"By removing the requirement to give notice, she has done away with due process and has expanded her already draconian powers that allow her to deprive anyone of British citizenship, provided she believes it is in the interest of the public good Reference has been made to powers that, according to the analysis of the Office for National Statistics, could affect 6 million people, many from a Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi, Jamaican or Nigerian background.",3
"Let us not forget that it is this Tory Home Office that presided over the mass deportations in the Windrush scandal; that it is this Home Office that continues to prosecute a hostile environment against migrants, refugees and asylum seekers; and that it is this Home Office that uses Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four” not as a warning, but as a guidebook.",3
"I therefore have no confidence, and neither do my constituents, that, based on its record, the Home Office will not further expand the scope of its powers to deprive someone of British citizenship on more spurious grounds The powers that the Home Secretary has even now to deprive someone of British citizenship already create two tiers in society based on foreign ancestry, but removing the requirement to provide notice takes things even further.",3
An individual stripped of citizenship will not be told or given reasons and will therefore have no real right of appeal—and all this can happen even as they are being deported.,3

"Ever since, Members from across the political spectrum have warned that this bad decision would force hundreds of vulnerable children to turn to people-smuggling gangs for assistance in travelling to Britain, placing them at greater risk of trafficking.",3
"When debating these issues, Ministers have made the shameful claim that so-called pull factors for refugees are a reason not to help unaccompanied children to safety.",3
"My amendment 150 to clause 28, using the “notwithstanding” formula, would exclude the Human Rights Act 1998, the European convention on human rights, EU and retained law and the United Nations refugee convention from judicial authority and judgment.",3
"This is all about tackling illegal immigration, which our 2019 manifesto made clear that we intended to and must resolve The amendment is not against genuine persecuted refugees; this is about economic migrants who claim that they are within the legal framework of protected refugees.",3
The illegal traffickers convince them to use our human rights laws to come over to our shores in the certain knowledge that they will be protected by our judicial system.,4
Illegal immigrants have no right to enter our borders.,2
"Despite the difficult journey that they have made to the French coast, they have no greater right to come here than any other illegal immigrant.",4
"The Government have provided a remedy partially in this Bill but not yet regarding the full legal framework of the Human Rights Act, the European convention on human rights, EU retained law and the refugee convention of 1951, as amended with universal application in 1967 by a protocol.",3
"On EU retained law alone, I have found on the Government’s website in the National Archives that this amounts to as many as 123 directives and regulations, spelling out masses of laws relating to asylum and immigration that originated in EU law and are now on our statute book, although a few have been revoked The official Home Office policy guidance for asylum screening is still essentially based on the same law, and it makes for dismal reading.",3
"At present, an asylum claim must be registered where an individual fears persecution or serious harm of persecution for any given reason on return to their country.",3
"How to evaluate a fear varies with every individual and can in many cases be deliberately exaggerated To be recognised as a refugee under the UN refugee convention, the claimant can assert that they have a well-founded fear of persecution and be not only unable, but unwilling, to go back to their country of origin or habitual residence.",3
"Furthermore, they can claim that they are within the judicial sphere of “the humanitarian protection policy”, and the discretion as to whether an asylum claim should be accepted is heavily weighted in favour of asylum, even if the claimants do not even use the term “asylum” when they arrive on our shores A paper by the highly distinguished former professor of law at Oxford, John Finnis, and Simon Murray explains in graphic terms the law and case law in more than 100 pages of detailed analysis.",3
They conclude that the European Court of Human Rights has wrongly circumvented fundamental principles originated in the European convention on human rights and the 1951 refugee convention.,3
"They also argue that, properly interpreted, the UK and other signatory states have no obligation to let in refugees arriving at our borders en masse, have no legal or treaty obligation to accept refuges at all, and have no obligation to provide asylum for dangerous refugees, such as criminals and terrorists.",3
"The European Court, by radical and unwarranted interpretation, has used the article 3 provisions on torture and inhuman treatment and the article 8 provisions on the right to private and family life to extend the ambit of claimants to encourage them to engage in unlawful immigration.",3
"Claimants are granted repetitive appeals that bring the immigration system under intense pressure at monumental expense to the taxpayer, with grave political consequences on the doorstep We need to pull the rug from under the traffickers’ feet, save the lives of those who are exploited by them, and protect our own manifesto promises.",3
"We cannot continue, with unwarranted interpretation and judgments by the judiciary, to allow illegal immigration I seek robust assurances today from the Government to resolve the matter by legislation, and I will press my amendment unless I get them.",3
New clause 13 would repeal the sections in the 2014 and 2016 Immigration Acts that restrict undocumented migrants’ access to work and services.,3
New clause 14 seeks to abolish the immigration health surcharge.,3
"I am pleased these new clauses have received lots of support from Members across the House It will perhaps be obvious to colleagues that these new clauses are about addressing the unjust suffering caused by the Government’s hostile environment, a term used to describe all the policies that make life difficult for migrants living in the UK by explicitly and deliberately treating them as less deserving of dignity and humanity than British citizens My new clause 13, in particular, seeks to overturn the denial of basic human rights.",3
"As new clause 14 highlights, the hostile environment even denies access to healthcare by scaring people from going to the doctor for fear of being charged or being reported, detained and deported No recourse to public funds, which new clause 12 addresses, abandons some migrants to having no safety net.",3
"It is breathtakingly cruel and unjust The disproportionate suffering that has been inflicted on migrants during the pandemic is well known, if apparently forgotten by this Government.",3
We have to stop the political immigration game of misinformation and cynicism that has such horrendous human cost.,2
"There is no doubt that one of the reasons we are seeing scenes of desperate people trying to cross the channel is the lazy but deadly anti-migrant political agenda that closes off safe routes to the UK One of the biggest myths perpetuated by politicians is that they are too afraid to talk about migration when, in fact, the opposite is true.",3
"Member for Stone (Sir William Cash) used the word “tsunami,” which is a disgrace Yet it is simply untrue that Britain takes in more refugees than everywhere else, and research shows that two thirds of asylum seekers crossing the channel in boats, for example, are finally granted asylum by the Government’s own measurements.",3
It is not just the asylum system that is broken; it is also the immigration enforcement system.,2
"Last year, the Public Accounts Committee reminded us that the immigration enforcement directorate has 5,000 staff and costs £400 million a year to run, but that every year for the last several years, there have been fewer enforced removals and fewer voluntary returns.",3
"In 2019—the last year for which figures were available—there were only 55 convictions for all immigration offences, yet we know that there are probably 1.2 million illegal immigrants in this country.",3
"I therefore ask the Minister: what is happening to the published aim of the immigration enforcement directorate, which is, “to reduce the size of the illegal population and the harm it causes” The reason why I tabled new clause 18—I much appreciate the support of the 17 colleagues who have signed it—it is that it would make it clear that it is a criminal offence to be in the United Kingdom illegally.",3
"My new clause would change that and address the issue of all the people who are here unlawfully Sky News has suggested that there may be about 87,000 new illegal immigrants coming in each year.",3
"Very few of those, relatively speaking, are failed asylum seekers.",3
"There is a much bigger problem of clandestines—those arriving without documents—and there is a very large number, estimated to be 66,000, of people who stay beyond any visa entitlement.",3
We have to deal with the wider issue of illegal migrants and enforce it properly.,2
Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) is wrong—that every person put in peril by the people smugglers is already safe on land in France and in many other countries before France.,3
The Bill shows compassion to those most in need of assistance and prioritises them over people who choose unsafe and illegal routes of entry.,3
It is right to prioritise protection of those most in need of it The third uncomfortable truth is that it is possible to have help for those people in greatest need and to have strong borders.,3
"It is vital that that is supported in the Bill Finally, I turn to the refugee convention, which is now 80 years old and out of date.",3
"With some 80 million displaced across the globe, we need a new global compact —a COP26 for the migrant crisis—to ensure that we finally work together globally to put an end to the migrant crisis and the small boat crossing routes that are leading to lost lives in the English channel.",3
"I rise to speak to new clause 44 on safe and legal routes, which is tabled in my name, and new clauses 15 to 17 on a statutory limit on immigration detention, which I tabled with the hon.",3
"New clause 44 goes to the heart of the Bill’s supposed objectives, which are predicated on stopping irregular arrivals of asylum seekers by encouraging those fleeing war and persecution to access safe and legal routes.",3
"It is a cruel deceit to say that the Bill’s measures encourage the use of safe and legal routes if we have no such meaningful routes There is much in the Bill to be concerned about, such as differentiation of refugees in contravention of international law, offshoring of processing claims away from protection, pushing back rubber dinghies and risking lives.",3
"The Government must face up to their responsibility and deliver those routes On new clauses 15 to 17, we are seeking to place a statutory limit on immigration detention and to respond to a missed opportunity in this Bill.",3
"During our inquiry, we spoke to a young man who had been trafficked from the Cameroon-Nigeria border.",3
"He had been beaten, raped and tortured, and he had made an irregular route to this country on a false passport.",3
"The asylum system certainly is broken, and this is not the Bill to fix it.",2
"How can we trust the Government to deliver any of these programmes, or anything to fix our asylum scheme, if we cannot even come up with that scheme, after many months, and after all of us in the House having received desperate emails from people in Afghanistan who were under threat?",3
"I agree with new clause 52, which would waiver visa fees for Commonwealth veterans.",3
"We ask them to put their life on the line as members of our country, yet we do not pay their pensions, and we do not allow them and their families visas to say that they are citizens of this country.",2
"I have stood in the camps of Calais and seen people smugglers wandering around, very maliciously.",3
"I have seen the people smugglers about whom so much is made, but it will not be measures in this Bill that sort them out.",3
"It was promised when we discussed the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020, and it was promised in the new plan for immigration that there would be a safe and legal route for refugees, and for people fleeing for their lives to whom we can offer safe harbour.",3
I am pleased to speak in this debate about secure borders during the pandemic.,3
"Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Nadhim Zahawi), who has made a huge effort to ensure that we vaccinate people as quickly as possible Strict measures are in place to protect our borders, with significant fines for those who do not follow requirements for testing, isolating and completing passenger locator forms.",3
I know that efforts are being made to further streamline and integrate checks with existing border security measures.,3
"I particularly hope that the process for approving those who need exemptions will be further improved to ensure quicker response times, especially for those needing medical treatment back here in the UK I want to finish by mentioning an issue that is of particular concern to my constituents in Stoke-on-Trent South: the breaches of our border security in the English channel by illegal migrants.",3
"I thank the Home Secretary for the robust action she has been taking to address the appalling criminal people traffickers who enable those dangerous journeys, and I fully support the Government’s new plan for immigration to address this issue.",3
"We must deter those who think that they can come here illegally with no consequence, and reduce the pressure being put on places such as Stoke-on-Trent.",3
"We have resettled more than most other parts of the country, while many have not taken in a single refugee.",3
"Just as they attempt to score political points on the issue of asylum, they have tried to play exactly the same game over international travel, repeatedly changing positions on borders throughout the pandemic and shamefully exploiting the benefits of hindsight.",3
"Friend the Minister for Defence Procurement—he represents Horsham, where my wife has family, as he knows—demonstrates the integrated nature of this review, as we have both a Defence Minister and a Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office Minister here.",3
"The integrated review is an ambitious and wide-reaching review, and the purpose of this integration is to examine every aspect of our international security, development and defence policy.",3
It is my pleasure to respond to this debate on behalf of the Government The Government want UK foreign policy to deliver for our people and to be rooted firmly in our national interest.,3
"That is why the commitment to deliver a review of foreign, defence, security and development policy was announced in the Queen’s Speech in December 2019.",3
"Friend the Member for Bournemouth East, the review is “the most radical reassessment of our place in the world since the end of Cold War” When published, the review will define the Government’s ambition for the UK’s role in the world, outline how the UK will be a problem-solving, burden-sharing country, and set a strong direction for the recovery from covid-19 at home and overseas so that collectively we can build back better I am pleased to be able to tell the House that the Government intend to publish the review in March.",3
"It has involved evidence-gathering and policy analysis, and wide consultation with experts, academics and foreign partners The Prime Minister, supported by the National Security Council, is personally leading the review.",3
"This demonstrates the integrated whole-of-Government approach to this review, going further than the strategic defence and security reviews of the past.",3
The announcements made in November’s spending review were informed by the first phase of the integrated review and set us on the right path to deliver on our visions and priorities.,3
"It ensures that our armed forces have the necessary tools and equipment to defend the UK and its people, cement our place as a leader in NATO and underpin our foreign policy and our ability to defend free and open societies On international development, changes to our ODA budget were driven by the economic impact of covid and are temporary.",3
"Last week, we submitted the notification of intent letter to begin the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership accession process The creation of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office itself was an act of integration, uniting development and diplomacy into one Department, bringing together Britain’s international efforts to have an even greater positive impact and influence on the world stage Let me end by saying that this is the opportunity to define and strengthen our place in the world.",3
"The integrated review will send a message about what the UK stands for as an independent actor on the global stage and how we will back this up with action to secure our interests and also defend our values The world has not stood still, and neither have we.",3
"In the past year alone, we have led the global efforts to deliver a vaccine, raising $8.8 billion for Gavi through our hosting of the global vaccine summit; we have demonstrated global leadership in tackling climate change, including doubling our international climate finance contribution to help millions around the world; and we have pushed back on those who would attack our values through the new bespoke immigration route for British national overseas status holders.",3
"This is global Britain The integrated review will build on that, setting out our vision for the next decade, based on our values and grounded in the UK national interest.",3
"We will announce the full conclusions of the integrated review in March, unleashing our independent foreign policy outside the European Union as we launch our presidencies of the G7 and COP26.",3
"He writes: “She has lived in this country for over 30 years, brought up three British children and is completely integrated into the life of her local town.",3
She is not part of any ‘immigrant community’.,3
"In two years’ time, she will lose those rights and be a foreigner, dependent on the good will of the Government of the day.” I have written back to and met my constituent, because I think it is inconceivable that our Prime Minister would separate this family.",3
"The Home Office deals with millions of visa, citizenship, passport and immigration status applications each year.",3
"In the past year, UKVI has received more than 3.5 million applications, and more than 98.5% of major application routes, including for non-settlement, EU applications and asylum, have all been decided within their service standards.",3
"Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Marion Fellows) First, it is important to note that it is entirely for the US Government to determine their immigration policy.",4
"The simple fact is that terrorist attacks, committed both in the US and in Europe over the past decade and more, have been carried out not by immigrants and refugees, but by radicalised nationals.",2
Not one refugee from the countries included in the President’s travel ban has killed anyone in terrorist attacks on US soil.,3
"Further, the decision to ban refugees from war zones such as Syria and Yemen will serve only to force vulnerable men, women and children to remain at risk of persecution and death.",3
"As I said to the Foreign Secretary this afternoon, 16 countries forbid admission to Israeli passport holders.",3
"In recent years, we have granted state visits to the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, all of whom forbid admission to Israeli passport holders.",3
"I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants—the people who helped build your country, ready to work hard in exchange for a fair chance at a new life.” Those are not my words, but the words of a Nobel prize winner.",3
"If the lord and saviour whom we both follow was to turn up today at the American border, he would not be allowed in.",3
He would have a Palestinian passport and no valid birth certificate and would not be able to prove that he was a Christian because he had not invented Christianity yet.,3
"On that day, we among millions of others remember the 900 Jewish refugees on the MS St Louis who were turned away from the United States and forced to return to Antwerp, plunging them back into the holocaust from which 254 of them would never emerge.",3
"It was of course in the aftermath of those horrors that the 1951 Geneva refugee convention was agreed, which was renewed afresh and signed by the United States in 1967.",3
Friend’s call for a European Heads of Government meeting to consider a united response to this Executive order and to the breach of the refugee convention.,3
"I urge the Minister to respond to those calls when he speaks Given the response of the Minister’s boss to my earlier questions—perhaps, more honestly, I should say the lack of response—may I ask him to address urgently the issue of the position of UK residents who are foreign nationals and not passport holders but residents?",3
"We heard nothing about punishing war crimes in Syria, the nuclear deal with Iran, or the illegal settlements in the west bank.",3
"If the President is going to discard those values, whether by embracing torture or ignoring climate change, or by demonising people as aliens and terrorists based simply on their religion and nationality on the very day on which we remember the holocaust, the Prime Minister must be willing to tell him frankly: “Mr President, you are wrong.",3
"This included Italy strengthening asylum processes and increasing returns, and Greece working to implement the EU-Turkey deal, where the UK is providing additional staff to support the interviewing of Iraqi, Afghan and Eritrean nationals At this Council, I argued that we must do more to dismantle the vile people-smuggling rings who profit from the migrants’ misery and who are subjecting many to unimaginable abuses.",3
"Indeed, just last month an operation between our National Crime Agency and the Hellenic coastguard led to the arrest of 19 members of an organised immigration crime group in Greece.",3
"We need to help to ensure that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, and help those countries to support the refugees so they do not have to make the perilous journey to Europe.",3
"We need a better overall approach to managing economic migration, one which recognises that all countries have the right to control their borders.",2
"These agreements will lay the foundation for our continuing trading relationships with these countries as we leave the EU At the same time, we will also seize the opportunity to forge our own new trade deals and to reach out beyond the borders of Europe to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike.",3
"This will be a defining moment for our whole country, as we begin to forge a new relationship with Europe and a new role for ourselves in the world We will be a strong, self-governing global Britain with control once again over our borders and our laws.",3
"I also want to draw the House’s attention to the fact that the Government published guidance for employers and service providers in November 2015 on how to deal sensitively with transgender and homophobic issues, further outlining their commitment to defending the rights of the LGBT community The Government have taken steps in every area of public life—from the workplace to schools, as I mentioned, and in our immigration policy.",3
"They have taken steps to stop the deportation of asylum seekers who have had to leave a country because their gender identification puts them at risk of imprisonment, torture or execution.",3
"Friend the Member for North Devon, who is no longer in his place, it is still illegal in many countries to be homosexual and in some countries it is punished by the death penalty.",3
All male homosexual behaviour remained illegal there for another 13 years after the law was changed here in England and Wales.,3
Charities told the Home Affairs Committee that they estimated that there had been a drop in the number of children and teenagers trying to get here illegally during the period in the autumn when a lot of this support was put in.,3
We were therefore reducing the number of dangerous illegal journeys by providing the safe legal routes and undertaking the managed work with other countries.,3
"That is crucial in terms of clearing the camp in Calais to prevent the trafficking, the modern slavery and the dangerous illegal journeys Ministers have given four reasons for closing the Dubs scheme.",3
Those agencies are all doing important work with child refugees in Greece and Italy and along the French coast.,3
"All were categoric that the ending of the Dubs scheme will increase, not reduce, the trafficking risk, and that by taking away the safe and legal routes it will increase the number of children and young people who end up in the arms of traffickers and smugglers’ gangs, not reduce it The hon.",3
These children are not economic migrants.,3
"They are refugees fleeing conflict, persecution, poverty, fear and desperation.",2
"Remarkable work has been done by the Department for International Development in countries surrounding Syria and war zones around the world, and that has played an important role in discouraging people from travelling to Europe Finally, and most importantly, safe and legal routes to the United Kingdom encourage children to engage with local authorities, rather than throwing in their lot with people traffickers in the hope of being smuggled into the United Kingdom.",3
"Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) was making —that anecdotal evidence suggests that when children were transferred from the Calais jungle to the United Kingdom, spontaneous arrivals by illegal means almost completely stopped.",3
"I am concerned that if we reduce those formal paths to asylum in the United Kingdom, we will be playing into the hands of people smugglers I have talked to charities that have worked with children in the camps of northern France, and there are countless stories of children who, after hearing that they will not be relocated to the UK through Dubs or the Dublin convention, have returned from safe children’s centres to the squalor of camps such as Grande-Synthe outside Dunkirk in order to find illicit routes into Britain.",3
"Safe relocation schemes such as Dubs and the Dublin convention mean that the Home Office can assess whether it is in the best interest of a child to be brought here, ensure that the most vulnerable or those with family in the UK are taken to safety, and encourage others to claim asylum in France The Dubs amendment’s passage into legislation marked an acknowledgement that we have a duty to do better than this.",3
"Member for Wirral South (Alison McGovern) on securing Three years ago, I had the opportunity to go to Turkey to visit a refugee camp very close to the Syrian border.",3
I went to al-Azraq to visit refugees and some of the host communities.,3
"The UK is the second-largest bilateral donor to the humanitarian response in Syria since it began in 2012, and it is one of the few EU countries to commit to 0.7% foreign aid spending.",3
"Between October 2015 and December 2016, the UK gave support to refugees and migrants during the Mediterranean crisis, many of whom were not from Syria but from other countries.",3
"The support included meals to refugees and migrants in migrant camps in Greece and Serbia, and relief items such as blankets, temporary beds and hygiene kits for refugees and migrants moving across Europe, as well as healthcare, emergency first aid, protection interventions, and legal support and assistance.",3
"We have also granted asylum or another form of leave to more than 8,000 children.",3
"This is crucial work that the Government are dedicated to continuing, through Dublin and Dubs, and under the vulnerable children’s resettlement scheme and the Syrian vulnerable person resettlement programme It is also vital, however, that we do not create a strong incentive for refugees to undertake that dangerous journey across the Mediterranean and put themselves in the hands of people traffickers.",3
"My Lords, immigration dominated the EU referendum.",3
"Given that the debate was about whether we should leave the European Union and not about whether we should leave the world, it is worth noting that not everyone who comes from mainland Europe to the UK has the intention to immigrate, nor is every immigrant who comes to our shores from the European Union.",3
"Currently, 5% of our care workers are from EU countries; approximately 90% do not have British citizenship and their future immigration status remains uncertain.",3
"Some 90% of British fruit and vegetables are picked, graded and packed by 60,000 workers from overseas, mostly eastern Europe.",3
"However, research carried out for the Financial Times suggests that three-quarters of EU citizens working in the UK would not meet current visa requirements for non-EU workers if Britain left the block.",3
Exiting the EU means that we can now realise a greater economic potential The United Kingdom has a long and rich history as a successful trading nation—long before the concept of the EU was ever envisaged.,3
"Such enterprising spirit is a part of our heritage which can now be released, no longer restrained by outside directives and burdensome regulations During the last 18 months, I have visited four overseas countries—Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Sudan.",3
"Aside from new trade opportunities, leaving the EU will allow us to regain full control of our borders.",3
"If our border policy is seen to have integrity, people may become less hostile to immigration.",3
"In addition, there would perhaps be more incentive to integrate following a proper process of migration, rather than having an open border I hope that we can also increase our educational links with academic institutions overseas.",3
"My Lords, our society recognises the plight of refugees and our moral obligations, including giving practical expression to our humanitarianism.",3
"Many refugees from Syria are still in the region and there is an enormous strain on the neighbouring countries: Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon—which is about the size of Wales and hosts a refugee population amounting to around 30% of its total population, and is not in fact a signatory to the refugee convention.",3
"In 2016, the UK received 3% of asylum applications made in the EU.",3
"Clause 1(1) provides that a person who has refugee status or humanitarian protection may apply for permission for family members to join him—when I say “him” from time to time, I generally mean “him or her”.",3
"I do not think it unreasonable for a refugee to have a right to be joined by family members, and it could not be said that those listed in Clause 1(2) are distant relatives.",3
"He said, “They’ve been told they have to go back to Birmingham because that was where my Mum was sent to live when she was an asylum seeker, and because I came as a refugee child on my own, I have to live in Essex, so we are still not together.",3
"The position of a 19 year-old daughter or son alone in a refugee camp without family support is something that would worry any of us At the meeting to which I referred, we also heard from Maya, a hugely impressive young Syrian.",3
So many of the young refugees I have met have been keen to contribute to society and are model citizens.,3
"Her father took the initial journey by himself and she and her mother later joined him under the current rules, but only after several attempts to get visas from the embassy in Beirut, having travelled from northern Syria, been held up at the border and arriving late at the embassy, where they were told that, as they had missed the appointment, they could not be dealt with, so that difficult and dangerous journey had to be repeated in both directions.",3
"Travelling through war zones is not like catching a bus at the end of the road Then there are the unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, whose situation has particularly caught the public imagination.",3
"In addition, the child must hold a valid entry clearance or leave to remain on arrival—I have referred to the difficulties in getting documentation—and a substantial fee is payable In the case of child asylum seekers, we are told by the Government that if we were to allow them to sponsor their parents or other family, this would act as a “pull” factor and they would be sent here by family so that the family had a way in.",3
"Without safe and legal routes, children are destined for abuse Giving the right to a child refugee to have his family join him would not be novel.",3
"We are concerned with the position post Brexit, but that is a regulation dealing with arrangements between states regarding the transfer of asylum applications.",3
"His daughter was in the Jungle, but he could not meet the fees and income requirements of our family visa rules and so he, the holder of a British passport, went to live in the Jungle to look after his daughter Clause 3 allows for the Secretary of State to make regulations, “to extend the definition of a family member, and … provide for requirements for evidencing family membership or dependency” I referred to evidencing, which is not as simple as Ministers ordered during the passage of what became the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act.",3
"Centres have been set up in France to help refugees—I had understood in conjunction with the UK, but we hear of difficulties in reaching them and of various practical problems.",3
"It helps to create sociocultural stability facilitating the integration of third country nationals in the … State, which also serves to promote economic and social cohesion” I agree.",3
"My Lords, I support the Bill and commend my noble friend Lady Hamwee on her tenacity and stamina in trying to improve the lot of refugees and asylum seekers.",3
"Imagine having to take the perilous journey across the Mediterranean and across Europe, eventually seeking asylum in a foreign country far from home where you may be unable to communicate very easily and where you feel hostility from a Government who express the wish to make the UK a hostile place for illegal immigrants, and then to be given little or no hope of ever seeing your family again Some of us, apart perhaps from the noble Lords among us who are lawyers, would hesitate to engage in any formal legal process involving a court or tribunal without legal representation, even in this country.",4
"Imagine being stranded in a foreign country where you have no knowledge of that country’s legal processes, cannot speak the language and cannot afford to employ a legal representative.",4
"What chance would any of us have of navigating complex legal processes in an attempt to be reunited with our family Now imagine that all those scenarios are happening at the same time: separated from your family, traumatised by the dangers which you have fled from and which your family members still face, still traumatised by the perilous journey you have undertaken, arriving in a hostile foreign country and being faced with a legal process you have no understanding of and no help in engaging with.",3
"If that were not bad enough for an adult to cope with, unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, as we have heard, have no recourse to bring their parents or other family members to join them unless there are exceptional circumstances.",3
"Of the 28 European Union countries, only Denmark and the United Kingdom do not allow applications for reunification from asylum-seeking-children—something that, as the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, has just mentioned, the Home Affairs Select Committee described as “perverse” Talking of perversity, it is only while someone is a refugee that they are able to bring other family members to the UK without having to have a sufficiently high income to qualify to do that.",3
"If a refugee does everything this country asks of him or her and is granted British citizenship, they are then prohibited from bringing their spouse to the UK unless they reach the spousal visa income threshold.",4
"If they were to string out their asylum application, they would not have to earn a high salary to achieve that end This Bill addresses all those issues.",3
It allows unaccompanied refugee children to sponsor their family members to join them; it allows former refugees the right to sponsor family member asylum seekers under the refugee reunion rules; and it reintroduces legal aid for refugee family reunion cases.,3
"That is a different situation, of course, because it is about grouping a family for the examination of asylum application, so it is not about residence or settlement, but it is a parallel situation.",4
"Member states even have an obligation to trace family members, including siblings and other relatives, residing in the European Union in order to bring the asylum applications together On Tuesday this week in the other place, the Conservative Member Tim Loughton sought, with cross-party support from Tim Farron and Yvette Cooper in particular, to persuade the Government to continue, if we Brexit, the essence of the Dublin regulation which, as he said, “allows unaccompanied asylum-seeking children to be reunited with their adult siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles, as well as their parents” He highlighted how for children who have lost their parents they are, “the last vestiges of family connection.",3
"It is worth noting that although Ireland did not opt into the directive, it has enshrined in its own domestic law the right of unaccompanied child refugees to act as sponsors for the purposes of refugee family reunion The second principle is humanity.",3
"In assessing the best interests of the child, member states should take due account inter alia of family reunification possibilities, the minor’s well-being and social development along with safety and security, particularly where there is a risk of the minor being a victim of human trafficking.",3
"Being reunited with close family is a way to ensure the welfare and safety of child refugees, as well as improve their chances of integration and recovery.",3
"Last week, there was a Guardian article about a teenager from Afghanistan whose asylum application was initially refused because it was not believed that he was under 18 or from Afghanistan.",3
"He could thrive much better in our society—and, given the resourcefulness of refugees, contribute to it, as noble Lords have mentioned, including the noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, and my noble friend Lady Hamwee In 2016, the Home Office published updated guidance.",3
"Separation of families can have a devastating impact on people’s lives, their rehabilitation from experiences of trauma and their ability to integrate in and adapt to our country.",3
"As has already been mentioned, the report from the Home Affairs Committee in the other place stressed the bureaucratic difficulty of family reunion and the current sponsorship and visa system.",3
"The report also recommended that the Government amend Immigration Rules to allow refugee children to act as sponsors for their close family On the grounds of all those principles, especially the last one, leaving families divided makes no sense and is costly in social and economic terms for us.",3
Improving the lot of asylum seekers and refugees in UK is a cause for which she has long fought.,3
"He, like many of the others in northern France, was reduced to playing refugee roulette, trying his luck every night through dangerous and illegal means instead.",3
"Too often the Government have said in debates on these issues that those pull factors will encourage more smugglers to operate Frankly, the argument about pull factors is a fig leaf and there is not a single shred of evidence to support it.",3
"Alexander Betts, head of the Refugee Studies Centre at the University of Oxford wrote in a New Scientist article in September 2015: “No existing sound research substantiates the political claim that giving people asylum in Europe stimulates more flow” In an email to me, Professor Ian Goldin, head of the Oxford Martin School of Global Challenges, says, “There is no credible evidence for the Government’s claim on pull factors.",3
"The simplest argument against this is that the pull factors have not changed, yet refugee numbers have increased dramatically.",3
"The pull factors that are cited for the UK, such as higher wages or attraction to the social security benefits are relatively unchanged over many years, yet refugee numbers have changed dramatically and can be shown to be directly related to the push factors, notably the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere” The Council of Europe’s Report of the Fact-finding Mission on the Situation of Migrants and Refugees in Calais and Grande-Synthe, France by Ambassador Tomáš Boček says: “I was told by the authorities that there was a reluctance to improve conditions because of concerns that this would act as a pull factor, leading more and more migrants to make their way to Calais.",3
"The current conditions raise potential issues under Articles 3 (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment) and 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of the European Convention on Human Rights” The EU Home Affairs Sub-Committee, chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Prashar, published a report last July on unaccompanied migrant children which says: “We received no evidence of families sending children as ‘anchors’ following the implementation of the Family Reunification Directive by other Member States; we were also told that in some cases unaccompanied children in the UK declined to take advantage of tracing and reunification procedures, even when these were offered.",3
"This is not surprising … many unaccompanied migrant children fear that attempts to trace family members living in their countries of origin could put those family members in danger” There you have it: pull factors, whether through improving humanitarian conditions in refugee camps or easing family reunion rules, will not cause people to pack up their lives in a backpack and risk an extremely hazardous journey to come to the UK.",3
"To do that they have to be pushed, and pushed hard I shall move on quickly to smugglers.",3
Do the rules that currently exist keep refugees out of the clutches of ruthless people smugglers?,3
The Government are correct in saying that smugglers are a real threat to refugees.,3
"In fact, even authorities in Europe, with all their many resources, cannot deal with the smugglers that currently operate in Europe, and vulnerable refugees fear them even more.",2
"The fact of the matter is that the fewer safe and legal routes there are to process asylum seekers, the more power the smugglers have The Human Trafficking Foundation’s independent inquiry in July this year, co-chaired by Fiona Mactaggart MP and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, found no evidence whatever that a safe and legal route to the UK constitutes a pull factor for traffickers targeting vulnerable unaccompanied children.",3
"In fact, it found the opposite—that the closing off of such routes feeds the trafficking and smuggling networks.",3
"The prices to get to the UK illegally go up, forcing children into situations where they are exposed to labour exploitation, sexual exploitation, criminal exploitation or a combination of all three.",2
"A simple truth coming out of the inquiry is that instead of protecting children who have fled to Europe for safety, the Government are failing them, leaving the way open for smugglers and traffickers to exploit them As a number of noble Lords have said, it really comes down to a question of what kind of Britain we want to live in; an open and welcoming country for those seeking sanctuary or a closed one.",3
"My Lords, I too congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, on her Bill, the purpose of which is to provide for leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom to be granted to the family members of refugees and to refugees who are family members of British citizens.",3
"In her opening speech, the noble Baroness explained the provisions of the Bill, including the extension of the list of eligible family members who can be sponsored in an application for refugee status or humanitarian protection.",3
"The Bill also provides for the reinstatement of the provision of legal aid in respect of refugee family reunion cases, which can be complex and lengthy.",3
"The current position under our Immigration Rules is that individuals making an asylum application may include in that application only a spouse, civil partner, unmarried partner or children under the age of 18, with those dependants being granted leave to enter or remain in the UK for the same duration as the sponsor if the principal application is granted.",3
"Child asylum seekers in this country are not able to sponsor a parent or carer to join them As has been said, an objective of the Bill is to reduce the incidence of the separation of family members in the light of the significant adverse impacts this can have, and so address the issue of the vulnerability of unaccompanied children and the exploitation many experience.",3
"Eighteen months ago the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee issued a report which, among other things, called on the Government to amend the Immigration Rules to allow refugee children to act as sponsors for their close family.",3
"The committee argued, as my noble friend Lord Dubs said, that it was perverse that children granted refugee status in the UK were not then allowed to bring their close family to join them in the same way as an adult would be able to do, and that the right to live safely with family should apply to child refugees as it does to adults.",3
"This was not a view shared by the Government, who argued that the current family reunion policy met our international obligations and said that there was provision to grant a visa outside the rules, which could be used in respect of extended family members, including parents of children recognised as refugees here, in exceptional circumstances However, we are one of only two EU countries that have neither opted in to the EU directive on family reunion, which sets out that unaccompanied child refugees are entitled to be reunited with their family members, nor provided for this in their own domestic law.",3
"When she responds, can the Minister provide some information on the number of visas that have been granted outside the rules in exceptional circumstances since July 2016, when the updated guidance was published, and the number of those that were in respect of parents of children recognised as refugees here?",3
I also ask that question in the context that the Government have no idea of the number of people in this country illegally and focus only on making it harder for this unknown number of people to live in this country illegally My final question is about the Government’s estimate of the impact on the net migration figure of the Bill.,3
"This contradiction is no doubt the case because, whatever their publicly declared net migration target, the Government know only too well the benefits that immigrants have brought and continue to bring to this country I hope that in the light of all these factors the Government will not try to argue or imply that we do not have the capacity to take into our country the additional people, under humanitarian family reunion principles, who might come here under the provisions of the Bill, unless they are going to provide hard evidence that the figure would be way above what anyone might have anticipated.",3
"I think it would be useful if I state up front, particularly in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, and my noble friend Lord Cormack, that I totally agree that immigration—and I say this as an immigrant—has enriched the UK, particularly for refugees who have made the UK their home.",3
"Since 2010, we have granted more than 100,000 refugees permanent residence in the UK.",3
"In the year ending September 2017, almost 9,000 children found shelter, security and safety in the UK—49,000 since 2010—and we are committed to resettling up to 3,000 vulnerable children, together with their families, from the Middle East and north Africa region, and 20,000 vulnerable refugees by 2020, around half of whom will be children.",3
"In comparing ourselves with the EU, I think we can stand proud because in 2016 the UK resettled more refugees—adults and children—than any other EU member state, and more than a third of all resettlement to the EU was to the UK.",4
"We are a welcoming country and we remain a welcoming country The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, asked how many visas have been issued outside of the Immigration Rules in family reunion cases since we published the new guidance.",3
In 2015 we issued 21 visas outside the Immigration Rules.,3
"We will continue to uphold our international obligations and welcome refugees to our shores, as we have done throughout history, as my noble friend pointed out I have listened to concerns for those separated from family members by conflict or oppression.",3
That is why this Government strongly support the principle of family unity and we already have a comprehensive framework for family members of refugees to be reunited here.,3
"This policy has seen more than 24,000 partners and children reunited with their refugee family members in the past five years.",3
"There are rules already in place for extended family of refugees in the UK to sponsor children where there are serious and compelling circumstances, and for British citizens to bring family here so that there is no need for children, in particular, to make illegal and dangerous journeys to get to the UK, as many noble Lords have acknowledged The noble Lords, Lord Dubs and Lord Kerr, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Sheehan and Lady Hamwee, talked about the pull factor and the Government not having evidence of that.",3
I absolutely accept that there are push factors but it is important that we do not create further incentives for asylum seekers to choose to come here illegally rather than claim asylum in the first country that they reach.,2
"It is important to note that the push factor of civil war or persecution is the deciding factor in whether or not an individual flees their country, but we must do all that we can to support those in need of protection to claim asylum in the first safe country to avoid these dangerous secondary movements We know that changes in policy impact on asylum seekers’ choices with regard to those secondary movements.",3
"In 2015, Germany, for example, saw its asylum intake increase by 155%.",3
"More than 20% of people who sought asylum in Germany in 2015 were from countries in the Balkans, which thankfully have not seen conflict for more than 20 years The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, talked about our no longer funding DNA tests for family children.",3
"There is provision to grant visas outside the rules—I have given those figures to the noble Lord, Lord Rosser—in exceptional cases and published guidance for caseworkers makes that clear The noble Lord, Lord Paddick, asked about former refugees being unable to sponsor family members under family reunion.",3
Most refugees will complete six years’ leave to remain before they can apply for British citizenship and they can sponsor their family members at any point during those six years.,4
"However, Dublin does not confer immigration status simply because an individual has a family member in the UK; it is a mechanism for deciding the member state responsible for considering an asylum claim.",3
"In addition, those recognised by UNHCR as refugees may be able to join close family members here in the UK through our mandate resettlement scheme.",3
I can assure your Lordships that we are listening to concerns about family reunion and discussing with NGOs how we can make improvements as part of our wider asylum and resettlement strategy.,3
Our family reunion policy meets our international obligations and allows thousands of refugees to be reunited with their immediate families.,3
"I have already laid out some of the figures, but it is important that our system does not encourage asylum seekers who have reached a safe country to choose to move elsewhere.",3
"We must avoid illegal migration from safe countries, which undermines our efforts to help those most in need The noble Lords, Lord Paddick and Lord Dubs, talked about reinstating legal aid in family reunion cases.",3
"It is important that it is provided for those most in need, including those who claim asylum Our focus remains on those who need protection and those fleeing conflict.",3
I am of course aware of the importance to those recognised as refugees in the UK of having their family join them here to support their integration.,4
"This includes granting visas outside the rules in exceptional circumstances and using our resettlement schemes to full effect, so that we help those who need it most.",3
"The person must be shown to be a genuine present and sufficiently serious threat to one of the fundamental interests of our society Except in exceptional circumstances, a foreign national subject to immigration control who has been convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to a period of imprisonment faces a mandatory refusal of visa or leave to enter the UK for a specified period.",3
This applies to those convicted in the UK or overseas The Government also recognise the importance of distinguishing between those who are entitled to come to the UK and stay here and those who are not.,3
"For those who need a visa to come to the UK, the application process requires the applicant to declare any criminality or immigration offence and to provide their facial image and fingerprints as biometrics.",4
"This allows us to check the details of any UK criminal record and identify important information about the applicant’s immigration history, including any travel ban or exclusion order.",3
"At the border we undertake similar checks against police, security and immigration watch lists, as I have already said, to identify people of concern.",3
"Border Force officers can and do refuse entry if they believe that a foreign national poses a risk The Immigration Rules include provision for leave to remain to be curtailed and for indefinite leave to remain to be revoked if we become aware that a person with leave, including refugee status, has been involved in gross human rights abuses.",3
"The measures proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, are not necessary to protect our borders from undesirable individuals.",3
"Member for Colne Valley (Thelma Walker), who made a very emotive contribution I vividly remember the debates we had in this Chamber on child refugees and the need to help vulnerable children stuck in squalid conditions through the Dubs scheme.",3
"In 2016, we transferred over 900 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children to the UK from Europe.",3
"In the same year, the UK settled more refugees from outside Europe than any other EU country.",3
"More widely, the UK has granted asylum or another form of leave to over 9,000 children in the past year alone.",3
We need to ensure that there are safe and legal means for unaccompanied child refugees to come to the UK.,3
"Where we do not have safe and legal routes, people smugglers not only operate but thrive We should be clear that primary responsibility for unaccompanied children in France lies with the French Government.",2
"Friend the Minister to urge his counterpart to ensure that the French are doing everything they can to process asylum applications While we continue to be a member of the European Union, we will participate in Dublin III, and it is in all our interests that we continue to co-operate on asylum and migration, both legal and illegal, once we have left the EU.",3
"That regulation is a mechanism to determine which member state is responsible for the consideration of any asylum claim, but it is not, and never has been, a family reunification route in and of itself We must look to the future, however.",3
"It was passed with the intention of bringing about 3,000 unaccompanied refugee children to Britain.",3
"We on the Labour Benches, and many on the Minister’s own side, cannot accept this decision The Government have wriggled out of their obligation to accept child refugees, shutting the door on the most vulnerable.",3
"We understand from refugee charities that a small number of admissions may have occurred in the past two weeks, in which case the point remains that this is too little, given the size of the refugee crisis and the plight and experience of refugee children across Europe.",3
"The UN has called for Britain to take 10,000 refugees per year The Home Secretary has said a number of times that she wants to avoid the Dubs scheme acting as a pull factor for child migrants or encouraging people traffickers.",3
"Where legal routes are limited, where children lose faith in systems and trust in officials, they turn to people traffickers or smugglers who exploit them.",2
"Will the Minister give an assurance that where it is in the best interests of unaccompanied children, they will be reunited with their families in the UK Iraqi refugee Mohammed Hassan died earlier this year hiding in a lorry’s wheel arch on a journey from Calais to Oxford, trying to reach his uncle.",3
The coroner highlighted the fact that UK border agency officials who had detained him only days before could have given him information regarding his right to family reunion under Dublin III.,3
We must prevent the regrowth of the Jungle and more tragic cases like that of Mohammed Hassan There is a great deal to be done in the face of the humanitarian and refugee crisis across the world.,2
The Labour party is clear that Brexit must not be used as an excuse to abandon our legal and moral obligations to refugees.,3
The Government must commit to ensuring that Brexit does not lead to any loss of rights for refugees.,3
"Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown), I ask the Minister for an assurance that the Dublin III definition of “family” will apply in the UK’s immigration rules post-Brexit.",3
"When refugee children come to the UK, we must ensure that they are treated fairly and that councils have adequate resources to provide them with the support they need.",3
Poverty among refugee families is a major cause of breakdown.,2
Will the Minister guarantee that core integration needs are covered for reunited families?,3
Will he meet me and representatives from the Scottish Government and Safe Passage to review best practice Britain has a proud tradition of honouring the spirit of international law and moral obligations by taking our fair share of refugees.,3
"Many noble Lords have talked about the figure of 480 children, but in the year ending 2017 the UK granted asylum or another form of leave to more than 9,000 children, and has done so for more than 42,000 children since 2010.",3
"Further to that, Eurostat figures show that in 2016 the UK resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any other EU member state, and in total over one-third of all resettlement to the EU was actually to the UK Our efforts do not end there.",3
"This support has provided lifesaving assistance such as shelter, water and sanitation, food, medical care, and protection for the most vulnerable migrants and refugees.",3
"This included the safe transfer of more than 750 unaccompanied children from France to the UK, and a commitment of £36 million, as the noble Lord pointed out, to help to provide alternative accommodation elsewhere in France for migrants and to maintain the security of the border controls in Calais, which are a critical part of our national security One year on from the Calais camp clearance, the Government welcome ongoing French efforts to manage what continues to be a challenging situation in the area.",3
We welcome the French Government’s recent decision to deploy more police to the region and to continue to provide alternative accommodation for migrants elsewhere in France.,3
"France has many of the same international obligations as the UK towards those on its territory, and migrants in France are the responsibility of the French Government.",4
"I know that noble Lords have become frustrated by me saying that time and again, but France is a democratic country and it is true that migrants in France are the responsibility of the French Government We also enjoy excellent law enforcement co-operation with the French authorities and other European partners.",4
Just last week there were 11 arrests in the UK for people smuggling under Operation Halifax—a Europe-wide investigation into an international organised crime gang that was smuggling migrants across Europe and into the United Kingdom.,3
"Key to our co-operation with European partners is the intelligence exchanged through the European Migrant Smuggling Centre, which leads Europol on organised immigration crime I want to be clear that there is no need for migrants to return to Calais and the surrounding areas in the hope of travelling illegally to the UK to claim asylum here.",3
France is a safe country and those in need of protection should claim asylum at the earliest opportunity.,4
"In 10 days, Bangladesh received more refugees than mainland Europe did from across the Mediterranean in the whole of 2016.",3
"In 1982, the Government of Myanmar passed a law declaring all Rohingyas to be illegal immigrants, thereby removing their citizenship.",3
"Sadly, it is not clear whether Her Majesty’s Government have ensured that UK support to assist the developing democratic Myanmar has not inadvertently supported this ethnic and religious discrimination, which is the basis of this crisis In your Lordships’ House on 6 June 2016, I asked Her Majesty’s Government how Rohingya with no identification papers could apply for UK tourist, work or study visas now on offer in Rangoon.",3
"I would like a guarantee that visas to come to the United Kingdom issued in Rangoon are in fact issued in a religiously and ethnically non-discriminatory manner, or we should stop issuing them to anyone.",4
"Could my noble friend please outline how many visas have been issued in Rangoon in the last two years and how many have been to Christians or Muslims who are within the ethnic minority population Similarly, is it the case that the embassy in Myanmar employs local people?",4
"The Government understand the concerns of the sector, including access to talent, being able to move people across borders to provide services, the importance of cross-border data flows and the mutual recognition of qualifications, on which I shall say more shortly.",3
"The Government will create a fair and sustainable immigration system that works for the whole of the UK To respond to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Randerson, and the noble Lords, Lord German, Lord Davies and Lord Whitty, the UK will remain an open and tolerant country that recognises the valuable contribution that migrants make to our society; it welcomes those with skills and expertise to make our nation better still The Government understand the report’s concerns regarding the challenges facing some parts of the sector, including the current provisions that support legal services trade.",3
The World Trade Organization estimates that around 55% to 60% of services trade relates to establishment overseas.,3
"The noble Baroness, Lady Randerson, was right to highlight the successes of that sector Data transfers are also crucial for our ability to co-operate across borders on law enforcement and security issues.",3
It is in the interests of both sides to maintain closely integrated aviation markets.,3
"The Royal Navy has intercepted 172 smuggling boats and saved more than 12,000 lives since Operation Sophia began.",3
"Our National Crime Agency is working with Libyan law enforcement, enhancing its capability to tackle the people-smuggling and trafficking networks.",3
"At the Council, we welcomed the reduction in migrant crossings and the renewed momentum behind the Libyan political process; but we must also continue to address the root causes driving people across the Sahara and the Mediterranean, so the UK is also continuing to invest for the long term in education, jobs and services, both in countries of origin and countries of transit On the digital single market, it is right to keep up the pressure on completing its implementation by the end of 2018.",3
"To turn away from Turkey now would undermine those who seek to secure a European future based on our shared values On North Korea, we welcomed the EU sanctions that were adopted last week, and reaffirmed our clear condemnation of North Korea’s aggressive and illegal missile and nuclear tests.",3
"For example, I have said that applying for settled status will cost no more than a UK passport, and that people applying will no longer have to demonstrate comprehensive sickness insurance.",3
"There will not be any physical infrastructure at the border, and we have also developed joint principles to ensure the continuation of the common travel area.",3
Do the Government intend to increase the resources available to address that reality Another area that is important in countering terrorism is the effectiveness or otherwise of border controls.,3
"Currently, scarce resources are available to be spent on telling people who have lived in this country for over 50 years that they face deportation before bundling them off to an immigration detention centre.",3
"On the other hand, resources are not available to prevent 11 people in a lorry from apparently being smuggled into this country undetected by border controls and found in a layby in Wiltshire only when they start banging on the side of the vehicle—11 people who could have constituted a terrorist threat.",3
"Enhanced border checks of cats and kittens are required, along with a central register of feline immigrants and tick and tapeworm treatment to prevent the import of foreign infections No less important to fluffy voters would be a crackdown on appalling breeding practices that bring to birth cats sentenced to a lifetime of pain by disfiguring features such as a flat face.",3
"As for other menaces that cats want curbed, they would welcome the forthcoming consultation on air weapon licences and the prospect that fewer of their number will be peppered cruelly by shots fired by guns for which, at the moment, no licences are required in England The wise election candidate in search of votes from domestic animals would give strong backing to a revision of the pet travel scheme, known generally as the pet passport.",3
"It has many benefits, but dogs as well as cats need action to deal with the sharp rise in the number of very young, badly abused immigrants.",3
"Investigations over the years by the Dogs Trust have shown how puppies, sometimes under the age of 15 weeks, are often sedated to smuggle them across borders and how data on passports is falsified.",3
"The abuse of the pet passport must be tackled urgently, with tough new penalties on illegal trading.",3
"So on this side we will work to achieve a departure that promotes jobs and the economy, safeguards our security and the environment and benefits all our nations, cities, regions, towns and rural communities, such that all might prosper from the new landscape that the Government envisage One issue is our role on the international stage.",3
"All will impact on our economy, but they will not cover many areas of the negotiations where we want a deal that puts jobs and the economy first, gives full access to the single market, allows levy-free and border-check-free movement of goods, and upholds the Brexit Secretary’s pledge to achieve the “exact same benefits” as now.",3
"All these help to keep the public safe With regard to immigration—I am sorry that this, rather than jobs and the economy, is still a priority for the Government—there are two aspects: the EU citizens already here and the longer-term approach.",3
"Despite what we heard from another Minister earlier, farmers have already been hit by a lack of migrant workers to harvest fruit and vegetables.",3
"There was a 17% shortfall in May, leaving some critically short of pickers and our summer strawberries at risk—just as Wimbledon is opening The chairman of the UK’s largest supermarket warns that a cap on immigration would have a, “materially detrimental effect on the UK economy”.",3
"As the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury said last Thursday, “trade deals, customs unions, single markets, financial passports are all without use unless they … serve individuals, communities and … society”—[Official Report, 22/6/17; col. 39] I believe that neither this House nor—certainly—the Opposition is out to block Brexit, but we will work to get the best for Britain.",3
"Margaret Thatcher signed the Single European Act—just as she created more comprehensive schools than any other Education Secretary, she did more European integration than any other Prime Minister.",3
"It is by staying in the customs union and the single market As for the notion that everything is going to be solved by technology—that we can set up border controls in Northern Ireland, Dover and Calais but they will be magically invisible and frictionless—that policy would last about as long as the Government’s social care policy when the frictionless and invisible border controls become queues of trucks on the M2 and M25 stretching to Watford I turn to the vexed question of immigration.",3
"Last June, the British people did not vote for fewer jobs and more poverty, but they do appear to have voted for more control over immigration.",3
"I am the proud son of a Cypriot immigrant—a postman for 35 years, who loves this country and who put far more into the Treasury than he ever took out.",3
"The anti-immigrant rhetoric of the leave campaign, particularly Nigel Farage’s disgraceful “Breaking Point” poster, made me—and, I think, many others in the House—physically sick However, I approach this, too, from a point of principle.",3
Any state worth the name must have control of its borders.,3
"The doctrine that we cannot have one without the other is a false doctrine—we are not dealing with the Holy Trinity, one and indivisible; we are dealing with EU doctrine, which is mortal and fallible—and is in fact contradicted by the most cursory examination not only of other customs unions but even some federal states I agree with President Macron’s adviser Jean Pisani-Ferry, to whom the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, just referred, who said recently: “There can be no doubt that the Leave campaign tapped into seams of genuine concern about the scale and speed of immigration.",3
"Free movement of workers is not indispensable for the smooth functioning of economic integration in goods, services and capital”.",2
Member for St Albans (Mrs Main) for describing the testimonies that she has heard and to the other 28 Members of the House who have spoken so passionately this afternoon The whole country has watched in horror as hundreds of thousands of people from Myanmar have been forced out of their homes and across the border into Bangladesh.,3
"The UN defines ethnic cleansing as “a purposeful policy…to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas.” It includes murder, torture, rape, severe physical injury to civilians, forcible removal, displacement, deportation of a civilian population, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks as well as the destruction of property, and robbery.",3
Rohingya villages in Rakhine state have been destroyed so as to ensure that the refugees cannot return to their homes.,3
"It is the most effective way to help the Rohingya refugees, and I am pleased Ministers are matching the funding from the DFID budget It is now vital that we press the Myanmar Government to allow full humanitarian access to Rakhine and full, unhindered access for the UN Human Rights Council’s independent international fact-finding mission, and to allow independent media organisations to report freely.",3
Will the Minister go back to his colleagues to see whether more money can be made available from the British Government so that disease is not the next thing to be visited on the refugees It is now evident that the British Government need to be prepared to take a tougher line with the military of Myanmar.,3
"Will the Government please consider imposing personal sanctions and visa restrictions against the military and their families; promoting an international arms embargo mandated by the UN along the lines of the EU’s; and halting investment in and business with military-owned companies, and ending any aid flows to parts of the country that they control We need a long-term, sustainable solution.",3
"This included Italy strengthening asylum processes and increasing returns, and Greece working to implement the EU-Turkey deal, where the UK is providing additional staff to support interviewing of Iraqi, Afghan and Eritrean nationals.",3
"At this Council, I argued that we must do more to dismantle the vile people-smuggling rings that profit from the migrants’ misery and which subject many to unimaginable abuses.",3
"Indeed, just last month an operation between our National Crime Agency and the Hellenic coastguard led to the arrest of 19 members of an organised immigration crime group in Greece As I have argued before, we need a managed, controlled and truly global approach, and that is exactly what this Council agreed.",3
"We need to help ensure refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, and help those countries to support the refugees so they do not have to make the perilous journey to Europe.",3
"We need a better overall approach to managing economic migration, one which recognises that all countries have the right to control their borders.",2
"For these agreements will also lay the foundation for our continuing trading relationship with these countries as we leave the EU At the same time, we will seize the opportunity to forge our own new trade deals and to reach out beyond the borders of Europe to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike.",3
"This will be a defining moment for our whole country, as we begin to forge a new relationship with Europe and a new role for ourselves in the world We will be a strong, self-governing global Britain, with control once again over our borders and our laws.",3
We want the UK to have the greatest possible tariff-free and barrier-free trade in goods and services with our European neighbours and for that cross-border trade to be as frictionless as possible.,4
It is therefore in the interests of both the EU and the UK for our deeply integrated trade and economic relationship to be maintained after we leave the EU The discussions that started last month have been and continue to be constructive.,3
"For example, on non-tariff barriers, many countries have authorised economic operator schemes—I know that the committee took evidence on this—which means that exporters with supply chains that are demonstrably secure are subject to fewer and less stringent checks at the border.",3
"She explained that at the DIT nearly 1,500 highly qualified members of its staff are now overseas.",3
"On a different issue, although it is important for the living standards of those who work in our industries, my noble friends Lord Leigh of Hurley and Lady Byford both raised the importance of the availability of overseas workers for agriculture.",3
I try to avoid using the term “migrant workers” because I appreciate that it can be offensive to our friends and colleagues across Europe.,3
"I reassured him about how seriously we take the contribution by workers from overseas to all our industries here, and I particularly mentioned seasonal workers I do not have time to go into great detail now but I can say that just last month, on 28 June, the Minister in this House, my noble friend Lord Gardiner, answered questions about foreign workers in agriculture and made it clear that we are having formal discussions on that subject.",3
I reassure my noble friend that for the migration phase HMRC is planning for the two systems to operate in tandem at the border.,3
"That will provide extra contingency, if it is ever needed, to ensure that the UK has a robust border declarations service.",3
"First, how will the residence and related social and welfare entitlement of the children of EU migrants currently living in the UK, and of UK migrants living in other parts of the EU, be affected?",4
"There are particular concerns about children in Northern Ireland here My second issue is that of securing the citizenship, residence and related social and welfare entitlement of children born in the UK to third-country nationals.",4
Children who wish to gain British citizenship have to register—a complex and costly experience.,4
"The conditions of citizenship in the Good Friday agreement state that people born in the north have the right to identify themselves as British or Irish, or both.",3
"EU law protects children in a range of contexts including child trafficking, immigration and asylum, sexual exploitation and labour.",3
It is a very difficult subject and I congratulate them on producing it An earlier contributor to the debate said that it is obvious that the scale of immigration must be reduced.,3
There simply was not a proper debate and everybody probably had their own view of what it meant to exit the EU I think that EU migration and wider immigration has been fantastic for Britain.,3
"That is mainly because they want reciprocal relations, but 69% of people think that free movement within the EU is a good thing, and we have to keep that in mind when we think of the movement of people generally We have to recognise that immigration can change our communities.",3
"It is the Government’s job to keep us secure and safe, to explain the situation to communities, and to help immigrants or migrants to assimilate, to join in and to have a secure lifestyle here.",3
They have suggested that the lack of GPs or school places can be blamed on immigration.,3
"If you meet a migrant in the NHS, they are much more likely to be treating you than to be ahead of you in the queue.",3
"Therefore, clearly the NHS sees the value of migration and immigration The lies about immigration mean that the real problems facing our communities are not solved.",3
We have to make our immigration system fairer and more humane.,2
"We have to end immigration detention, scrap the minimum income rules for visas and make family reunion easier I and, I know, a lot of other people were extremely embarrassed that the Government did not immediately give EU nationals the right to remain.",3
"They have used these people as bargaining chips, which is a very unpleasant thing for them to have done I am not sure where we are on the Tory aim of introducing a cap of 100,000 on the number of immigrants.",3
The cap is based on the premise that migrants are damaging to our economy but that simply is not true.,2
A third of doctors are foreign born.,3
"On international students, stricter rules could cost our economy £2 billion, and counting them as immigrants is absolutely wrong.",3
They have not just handled it badly but lied about the impact of migrants and immigrants on our society and economy.,2
We do not hear enough about the benefits that migrants bring.,2
The whole anti-immigrant narrative has been very nasty and difficult to challenge.,2
"We are one of the most open economies in the world for foreign investment, so we welcome foreign companies but not foreigners—unless they are really rich, at which point, under the tier 1 investor visas, permanent residence can be bought.",4
"Under such visas, a rising number of Chinese and Russians whose wealth came from not entirely clear places were allowed in.",3
"Several of us have been involved in trying to change the rules on that and I am happy that the Government have now tightened them Given that we are a country which is remarkably open to foreign investment and is therefore dominated by multinational companies, talented young British people who want to rise to the top of those companies need to be able to work abroad and to be able to travel without the complications of getting visas to work in foreign markets.",3
"If multinational companies based in Britain, be they European, Japanese, Chinese or whatever, say to themselves: “Well, actually, promoting a Brit and making them work in Frankfurt for this year and Athens the next would be an awful nuisance because of the time it will take them to get visas”, they will promote French people, Germans and others instead.",4
"Another part of what has been wrong with our entire debate about leaving the European Union as far as immigration is concerned is that we have not thought about it as a properly two-way relationship Robert Goodwill has been quoted as saying to the committee that the UK Government do control their borders, at least in principle, but we have heard in this debate that, in practice, they do not manage that very well.",3
"I was struck some months ago when we had a question in this House about how many offshore patrol boats we had around the extensive maritime borders of the United Kingdom, to which the answer was a quarter of those that the Dutch have for their short coastline.",3
I gather that we have fewer offshore patrol boats for our borders than any other EU member state except Belgium.,3
"Again, our borders are entirely open because we have had Governments so concerned with shrinking the state that they have given up on the idea that one must enforce control of our borders and existing immigration controls A lot of other noble Lords talked about the problems of statistics.",3
There they believe that foreigners from Romania or elsewhere are taking their social housing and their jobs.,2
An excellent article in the Financial Times on Portsmouth some months ago pointed out the widespread perception that most social housing there was now occupied by immigrants from the EU.,3
That level of misinformation and lack of information is a tremendous problem for us all I will spend a little more time on the question raised in chapter 4: the pull factor of immigration from the European Union and the extent to which British employers prefer to recruit directly from eastern Europe rather than to train their own or recruit directly from here.,3
"We are not training enough nurses of our own, so they are even more important Clare Foges in today’s Times talks about the unfortunate bias of the current debate on immigration: the suggestion that somehow voting leave could solve our immigration problems and that European immigration is the key to that.",3
The spectre of 80 million Turks swarming into Britain successfully blurred the issue between immigration from Europe and from the rest of the world.,3
"The long-term immigration challenge we face, alongside other European countries, is from the rest of the world, where population is rising, climate change is making life more difficult and nasty regimes or violent conflict combine to push people north to struggle, if they can, across Turkey or the Mediterranean.",2
That is the immigration issue we should talk about So we are struggling with a distorted image.,2
There is also a distorted image popular in the Daily Mail and elsewhere that all our European immigrants are Poles and Romanians living on benefits or taking low-paid jobs from the unskilled British.,3
"Overall, half of the EU arrivals in 2015-16 came from the 14 wealthy states of western Europe, not from Romania, Bulgaria and elsewhere The noble Lord, Lord Green, tells me that the reason Migration Watch statistics for Germans in Britain are 150,000 higher than the ONS statistics is that Migration Watch counts children as immigrants where one parent is born outside Britain.",3
"That puts me in mind that I am about to become the grandfather of an immigrant because my son’s American wife, currently living with him in Edinburgh where he teaches at the university—",3
"The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Eames, spoke about the particular issues faced by people living in Northern Ireland, which will share the only land border with the European Union.",3
"Making sure that people’s basic needs are protected is important, and it is essential that reassurance is given to people who live in the border areas.",2
"I have many friends who live on both sides of the border, and my parents and many members of my family live in the Republic.",3
"As we have heard previously in your Lordships’ House, the Maastricht treaty introduced the concept of EU citizenship and the 2004 citizens’ rights directive codified various rights for citizens, which have been transposed into UK law.",3
"The more recent EU-Canada agreement does not include the free movement of people but provides for much more limited tariff-free access to the single market Immigration to the UK comes from the EU and from non-EU countries, and immigration from non-EU countries has generally been higher than from EU countries.",3
"The noble Lord, Lord Kirkhope of Harrogate, made an important point about why people immigrate and what a wide term “immigration” is.",3
He is right that lots of work has taken place to integrate people and that this country has a proud record as a safe haven.,3
I could not agree with her more when she said that if you go into hospital you are more likely to be treated by an immigrant than be in the queue with one.,3
I am the eldest son of immigrants: my parents came from Ireland to make a life for themselves.,3
"The noble Lord, Lord Oates, was right to point out that the Conservative Party had made a pledge on immigration that had been very damaging and it had never sought to champion the positives that immigrants can bring to the UK The noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, looked at the spontaneity of free movement and rightly highlighted the issues that Brexit will bring to the creative industries.",3
"We have some of the most talented people in the world working in the creative industries, and they need the support of the Government to protect their ability to move and work to make a living for themselves, and contribute to our economy The noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, referred to the desire of the Government to reduce net migration and the disconnect between immigrants coming here to work and people leaving the UK to retire.",3
"Whatever decisions are made in respect of immigration from the EU, jobs and the needs of business, industry and the economy must be at the forefront of government policy.",3
"A generous statement right at the start could have got the negotiations off to a much better start, but the Government took a different view and we are living with that decision The report highlights that the UK and EU may find themselves negotiating which elements of full integration they want to get out of the single market, which the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, referred to.",3
"There could be a real risk of UK citizens becoming third-country nationals for the purposes of EU law and the domestic immigration rules of EU member states, once the UK leaves the EU.",4
"As I highlighted earlier, immigration to the UK from the EU is primarily for work.",4
"This would fail to deliver a meaningful reduction in immigration while proving to be onerous and costly for employers, the workers and the enforcement agencies, as we have heard from other noble Lords.",3
"I agree very much with the committee: the Government must not close off options for themselves as negotiations proceed, while there could be many benefits to the UK in offering preferential treatment to EU nationals The report also presents some challenges to the Government and their thinking in respect of migrant labour from the EU.",3
"Perhaps the Minister could address the specific question of preferential treatment for high-skilled migration in relation to low-skilled migration, as there does not appear to have been an increase in highly-skilled jobs in the UK The committee also questions the link between the availability of migrant labour from the EU and the incentive to train or upgrade the skills of resident workers in the UK.",3
The fact that there are problems here could be one of the issues that led people to vote to leave the European Union last year I agree with the committee that reducing EU immigration is unlikely to deal with the problem of low wages.,3
"We should look at the self-employed EU migrant worker but also at the deregulation and flexibility of working life generally, and whether we have struck the right balance.",3
"The report questions assumptions about UK workers filling jobs vacated by EU migrant workers and challenges the evidence for that assumption As I said earlier, these are difficult times for our country, and decisions made by the Government should be on evidence-based policy.",3
Changes to the availability of migrant workers will vary from sector to sector.,3
"The Royal Navy has intercepted 172 smuggling boats and saved over 12,000 lives since Operation Sophia began, while our National Crime Agency is working with Libyan law enforcement, enhancing its capability to tackle the people-smuggling and trafficking networks At the Council we welcomed the reduction in migrant crossings and the renewed momentum behind the Libyan political process, but we must also continue to address the root causes driving people across the Sahara and the Mediterranean.",3
"To turn away from Turkey now would undermine those who seek to secure a European future based on our shared values On North Korea, we welcomed the EU sanctions adopted last week and reaffirmed our clear condemnation of North Korea’s aggressive and illegal missile and nuclear tests.",3
"For example, I have said that applying for settled status will cost no more than a UK passport and that people applying will no longer have to demonstrate comprehensive sickness insurance.",3
There will not be any physical infrastructure at the border and we have also developed joint principles to ensure the continuation of the common travel area.,3
"Just this week we see government borrowing exactly on target for the year end, stock markets booming and 40-year UK government debt with a very low coupon being fought over by foreign investors, who were desperate when the Debt Management Office put it up for sale a couple of days ago.",3
"We are just at the beginning of negotiations, when reciprocal and reasonable rights will be one of the issues to be finally resolved Most EU citizens are very well settled in and integrated here.",3
"Problems always come when people feel that immigration has tipped the balance; that is what we see in East Anglia, Lincolnshire and elsewhere.",3
That is why control of our borders is so important We also have to recognise that the balance can change quite quickly in the other direction.,2
"I am told that a fair number of EU immigrants to this country have left or are now considering leaving because the drop in the pound—which, as we have seen, helps exporters—is hitting the value of their wages, and hence the remittances they can send home.",3
I believe that reasonable control of our borders on a needs-first basis is a national good in the interests of balance in all parts of the country.,3
"Whether it is up in the north-east with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham or elsewhere, we want good, integrated immigration and settlement, not immigration that causes trouble In the closing moments of my speech, I want to reflect on what the right reverend Prelate said in the closing moments of his speech.",3
In my view it has worked extremely well; it is inconceivable that we would have had the growth we enjoyed in the 10 years before the Lehman Brothers collapse and the banking crisis if we had not had the immigration we then enjoyed from other parts of the EU.,3
"I think I was the first person to alert your Lordships’ House a couple of years ago to a study done by the University College London economics team showing that the contribution made by eastern European immigrants in this country in the form of national insurance and taxation was far greater, by billions, than their consumption of public services or receipt of any kind of benefits.",3
"In other words, every taxpayer in this country was better off as a result of eastern European immigration.",3
"That was not true of other groups of immigrants to this country, but it was particularly true of them On the whole, the experience has been a very happy one.",3
"That would be a problem of a quite different order of magnitude from the integration of people from eastern Europe, which on the whole has been a very happy experience.",3
It has been a matter of perception: people have been concerned that there is no limit to the immigration that can result.,3
"The German Chancellor’s decision to invite 800,000 refugees from Syria to Germany enormously undermined confidence in this country because there was a sense that these people would arrive in Germany tomorrow and be here the next day.",3
"Whether we are part of it or not, the European Union will need to look carefully at strengthening the external frontier and to take serious measures, such as the Australians have had to do, to prevent illegal immigration becoming a major social problem I hope we have other opportunities to discuss this matter in greater detail, because it really deserves it.",3
"On Wednesday, he signed two executive orders to boost border security, including with reference to the wall and the crackdown on illegal immigrants This week, we have also seen television interviews in which President Trump said he will bring back torture as an instrument of policy.",3
"According to the Washington Post, the proposed funding review is envisaged to take a year and be overseen by a panel, including the Departments for Defense, State and Justice.",3
"As we leave the EU, we will remain actively engaged in the full range of UN activity and will promote reforms to strengthen the UN’s ability to meet future challenges One of those challenges, of course, is on refugees and migration.",3
The Prime Minister has set out three guiding principles: refugees should claim asylum in the “first safe country” they reach; states should exercise their right to protect their borders and commit to taking back their nationals; and there should be a clear distinction between refugees and economic migrants.,3
We have made it clear that we must ensure we provide proper protection for refugees.,3
"We also want to allow global economies to enjoy the benefits of controlled migration, while providing protection for the most vulnerable migrants, including victims of that evil trade, human trafficking.",2
"The UK supports their reform plans, which include closer integration of humanitarian and development assistance.",3
"Indeed, a British citizen whose parents were born in Ireland could—as many have done since the referendum—apply for an Irish passport without giving up their British citizenship, because British citizens are also allowed to hold dual citizenship.",4
"This means that you do not have to renounce your British citizenship if you apply for an Irish passport However, for those who choose to be both British and Irish or just Irish, will they also be citizens of the European Union as they are now?",4
"I presume that they would: the Minister will, I hope, confirm that Irish citizenship automatically confers EU citizenship rights, so that right to be a citizen of the European Union would remain.",3
"Will those born in Northern Ireland claiming Irish citizenship remain EU citizens, albeit living outside the EU Can we assume that the position would be analogous to someone being able to apply for dual French and British citizenship—for example, if they were British, but had French parents?",4
"As long as France remained in the European Union, the French citizenship would confer the right to EU citizenship by extension; in the case of Northern Ireland, however, it will apply to a whole society—Northern Ireland’s—and not just individuals claiming European citizenship through relatives.",4
"Irish citizenship may of course also be available for those with grandparents who were born on the island of Ireland, which includes Northern Ireland.",4
"Such rights are underpinned in domestic law by the treatment of Irish nationals as non-foreigners under the Ireland Act 1949, and the acknowledgement of their special status in subsequent legislation including the Immigration Act 1971, as well as by the provisions of the British Nationality Act 1981 ...",3
"In addition, under the terms of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, the people of Northern Ireland have the right to identify as British, Irish or both, and to claim citizenship accordingly.",3
"Those who claim Irish citizenship would, by extension, be able to claim EU citizenship” Last week, I raised the thorny issue of the border in the context of Brexit.",3
"Nationalist and above all republican buy-in to the peace process has been cemented by an open border, as it normalises relations between both parts of the island.",3
"Both magnanimity and mutual respect is needed, otherwise Northern Ireland will get completely bogged down in its gruesome past, instead of properly supporting victims and building a new future To conclude, I ask that the Minister gives a proper and full explanation and guarantee about the entitlement to Irish and therefore European citizenship of people from Northern Ireland.",3
"When the Maastricht treaty introduced the concept of European citizenship, few envisaged that millions of people would wish to travel to one European country and settle there.",3
"But the population of the UK has risen by 5.6 million in the past 11 years and has been estimated by Migration Watch to rise a further 5 million to 70 million by 2025, although only some of this increase represents movement here from EU countries We have always been an outward-looking nation, welcoming and in the early days even seeking immigrants, who have in turn contributed to the richness of our cultural life and the wealth of our businesses.",3
"So immigration is, has been and will continue to be a good thing for the United Kingdom post Brexit.",3
"But there must be a tipping point at which uncontrolled immigration just puts too much stress on our public services, housing stock, jobs and public finances.",2
"It is not an affirmation or incorporation of such acquired rights but a proposal for a different offer: a new status under UK immigration law, called settled status, which has to be applied for and appears to be essentially indefinite leave to remain—perhaps the Minister could explain how it is different from ILR.",3
"I would welcome answers on that It is proposed to make deportation easier, but what will the precise criteria be?",3
How will the European Convention on Human Rights apply to those deportation criteria?,3
"The fear is that this vagueness will deter people from taking up jobs that involve overseas postings if they do not know whether an absence of more than two years is going to mean that they cannot come back Other noble Lords, including the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, have talked about enforcement, which is a key issue.",3
"If these rights are enshrined only in UK law, the fear would be a future amendment, abrogation or repeal, perhaps in response to public pressure about too many foreigners.",3
There is no dimension of European citizenship or recognition of EU legal jurisdiction.,4
"Yazidis and other religious minorities were excluded, not because they were not vulnerable according to the Government’s criteria set or because they were not refugees, but simply because they held the wrong passports.",3
"Daesh persecuted regardless of the Sykes-Picot border, but Iraqi refugees were not eligible for the scheme.",3
"We were surprised and delighted that, on 3 July, Her Majesty’s Government announced that the Syrian vulnerable people resettlement scheme had had its criteria expanded to accommodate the resettlement of non-Syrian refugees who had fled the conflict.",3
"Information that we have received from NGOs working in the region highlights that members of persecuted groups, including the Yazidis, are now eligible for resettlement under this scheme There is, however, also anecdotal evidence from NGOs on the ground that locally hired UNHCR staff are not accurately recording the vulnerability of refugees who have different faiths to themselves, preventing some of the most vulnerable from accessing the resettlement schemes.",3
"Can Her Majesty’s Government please ensure that, as religious minorities were targeted by Daesh, those refugees coming to the UK should at the very least reflect the religious make-up of Syria and Iraq prior to the conflict?",3
"Can my noble friend please confirm, perhaps by writing to me later, that Yazidis who fled IS but went directly into Turkey will now qualify under our amended scheme I am also pleased that the report by the all-party group and the Asylum Advocacy Group from July 2016, Fleeing Persecution, which looked at how the Home Office assesses claims for asylum here in the UK based on religious persecution, has been taken seriously by the Home Office.",3
We are working with them to retrain caseworkers on handling religious persecution asylum cases here in the UK.,3
"Religious persecution is one of the seven grounds for those applying for asylum here on which a claim can be made, but it is perhaps the most complex.",3
"The APPG looks forward to working with the Home Office asylum team on this task over the coming weeks and is grateful to the NGOs, faith leaders and academics who are helping the Home Office in this task The welcome by the Church of England through its involvement in the community sponsorship scheme—as outlined by the right reverend Prelate—is encouraging, but I would be grateful to know if Her Majesty’s Government are seeking to learn from Canada, a fellow Commonwealth country, which seems to have a very effective resettlement process and integration strategy.",3
"But the richness of my community now also includes those who have fled persecution in the Horn of Africa, were given refugee status and then became naturalised.",3
"If Her Majesty’s Government are minded to create a Minister for refugees, can they give serious consideration to locating that Minister in DCLG, not the Home Office?",3
Both show that UK immigration and settlement policy is just not fit for purpose.,3
"The battles we have fought over the years are still unresolved: the right to work, adequate benefits, indefinite detention and fair treatment of young asylum seekers on reaching 18 years of age.",3
"It has been mentioned that there will be a revisiting of asylum decisions after five years, which will mean that, after that period, people who have come here and have been granted asylum can be placed in a situation where they could well be deported.",3
The whole immigration process is a labyrinth of confusion—it is time for a complete overhaul and to listen to all concerned organisations so that they can contribute and their voices will be heard in any future legislation Tonight is also an opportunity to say thank you to all those have worked to exhaustion and often put their own careers on hold to meet the needs of those fleeing war and destruction.,3
The refugee camps would not exist or function without them.,2
We are eternally in their debt—not only major charities but many smaller bands of people who have really gone to extremes and sacrificed in order to man these refugee camps.,3
"At home, too, we have scores of communities where people have opened their hearts and their homes to refugees.",3
A host of projects have assisted with integration.,3
"He wants to be a footballer, so I am thinking of getting together a refugee football team.",3
I mentioned before how people in Aberystwyth welcome asylum seekers.,3
The asylum seekers gave flowers to the people of Aberystwyth Canada has been mentioned once or twice.,3
"It has accepted 40,000 refugees.",3
"Here, we speak about choirs and sports teams and about so much that is done, and we say thank you to those people who have made sacrifices to help folk to integrate.",3
There are critics at the extremes who would deny any positive work with refugees.,3
"We have come a long way from strong and stable; by any measure, it was a shallow Budget with spiteful side-effects on the working poor I want to finish with a brief point about immigration, which has been used by the Brexiteers in respect of the economy since 2013.",3
"On top of all the misery that is out there, we now have a new climate of fear spreading in this country due to the promised hostile environment for immigrants.",2
"The signal has been sent from the top—cut corners and use fear—and it is not only towards illegals, as claimed.",3
"There is evidence of elderly people who have been resident in the UK since the 1960s, when they were children, being picked up and bundled off to detention centres with a view to deportation to countries they have not been in since the age of 10.",3
"She was picked up and spent a week in Yarl’s Wood detention centre with a view to being deported to Jamaica, a country she has never visited since she left.",3
No other country has an agreement with the EU that does not involve a contribution of that kind The reason usually given is that we wish to have more control of our borders and deal with the free movement of labour—the point made by the hon.,3
"I quite accept that we have a political problem in this country on the subject of immigration; we need to accept that in a serious, professional and civilised manner.",2
"I do not have personal hang-ups about immigration—it is certainly no question of culture, race, or anything of that kind, as far as I am concerned.",4
"There are people who do not like foreign languages being spoken on the bus, but I think that they are outnumbered It is undoubtedly the case—it is a fairly easy case to make—that EU nationals of all the ethnic groups in this country are the most likely to be in productive and valuable work and the least likely to be claiming benefit, and they are allowed here on the basis that they will take work.",4
The public do not actually get upset about German academics or Romanian nurses or Polish building workers; it is the sheer numbers of other immigrants who come here.,3
"They never explained that for the huge numbers of people wanting to come here from Africa, the middle east, Afghanistan and so on it was an entirely sovereign decision for the United Kingdom whether they were given legal status to live here and nothing whatever to do with our membership of the European Union, which does not make the faintest difference I am quite clear that this country should behave in a civilised and responsible way towards the world’s poor, that we should certainly honour our international law commitments on this subject—on the law of asylum and so on—but we have to reassure people who decided to vote leave because they saw all those pictures of people on the beaches of Libya, and thought our borders had been lost and that it had something to do with the EU that so many of them were trying to come here.",3
"Lots and lots of young men take the family savings and risk their lives paying people smugglers, and they mainly head for Germany, Sweden or the United Kingdom.",3
"We have been co-operating, and we should continue to do so, with the other member states on issues such as tackling the problem of crossing the Mediterranean, and sealing the outer European border but controlling it in a way that lets in people whom we need or to whom we have an obligation, moral, legal or otherwise.",3
"The idea that leaving the European Union means that people will stop trying to get across from Calais or Ostend is an illusion More importantly, our big problem, which is normally shoved under the carpet but has been mentioned several times in the media recently, is the huge number of undocumented illegal immigrants in this country.",2
British people smugglers are bringing them in.,3
"There are people who have been refused asylum but have never left, people who have overstayed their visas.",3
"We cannot just deport people who are probably using a false name, who are probably not giving their genuine nationality.",2
"We have to try to persuade some country to take them back because we want to deport them, but that country will deny that they want these people or that they are anything to do with them To start concentrating on freedom of movement of labour and trying to put in unnecessary barriers to people who, as every study shows, have been making a positive contribution to the economy of this country for most of the past few decades, is a substitute for facing up to the enormous problems of reassuring our public that we are not sacrificing our humanitarian values but we do understand that we cannot take the world’s poor and that we need some system to address that.",3
"Labour and the EU citizens’ rights group the3million found more than two dozen examples of job, housing and other adverts that illegally prevented applications from EU nationals.",3
"Over the summer, it sent hundreds of letters to EU nationals living in the UK, ordering them to leave the country or face deportation.",3
The Government must urgently improve their offer and stop acting as if this settled status is a settled matter The problem with settled status is that the Government seem to think that assimilating EU nationals into our existing immigration system is sufficient.,3
The Government will have to realise quickly that both our non-EEA and EEA immigration systems need a total overhaul.,3
"Despite the pensioner stereotype, some 80% of them are working, often on a cross-border basis.",3
"Gentleman has noticed, but pollution does not stop at national borders The most hallucinatory of the Eurosceptic nostalgics in the Tory party dream of a frictionless divorce with no real consequences, economic or otherwise—a trade deal swiftly done which grants the UK all the benefits of EU membership with none of the costs.",3
"First there were the xenophobic speeches at Tory conference announcing the creation of lists of foreign workers, then the months of confusion about the nature of the Government’s plan, then the Prime Minister’s speech, and finally a promised, but as yet unpublished, White Paper If she does not get her way in Europe, the Prime Minister has threatened to create a low-regulation Britain with fewer human, civil and workers’ rights guaranteed in law, unmaking decades of social progress.",3
"They were told they could expect, and they voted for, more money for crucial services, and sensible controls on immigration.",3
"We throw away established relationships and economic connections, including deeply integrated European supply chains and cultural affinities.",3
We alienate our closest allies in perilous times.,3
"Just as Interior Ministers are following up on the online agenda we set at the G7, so Finance Ministers will follow through on these G20 commitments to cut off the funding that fuels the terrorist threat we face I also called for the G20 to come together better to manage the risk posed by foreign fighters as they disperse from the battlefield in Syria and Iraq, and we agreed we would work to improve international information-sharing on the movement of individuals known to have travelled to and from Daesh territory.",3
That includes ensuring that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach; improving the way we distinguish between refugees and economic migrants; and developing a better overall approach to managing economic migration.,3
It also includes providing humanitarian and development assistance to refugees in their home region.,3
"At this summit, the UK committed £55 million to support the Government of Tanzania in managing their refugee and migrant populations and to support the further integration of new naturalised Burundian refugees Turning to modern slavery, it is hard to comprehend that in today’s world innocent and vulnerable men, women and children are being enslaved, forced into hard labour, raped, beaten and passed from abuser to abuser for profit.",3
"If, in an outrageous conflagration of issues around fake news and election-fixing by a foreign power to enable a reality TV star with a narcissistic personality disorder to occupy the most powerful executive office in the free world, I take against Facebook, can I withdraw consent for my data to be used to inform artificial intelligences that Facebook can go on to use for profit and for whatever ethical use they see fit?",3
Many have seamless integration with the school management information systems that thereby expose children’s personal data to third parties based on digital contracts.,3
"Incidentally, this is the same data about pupils that was shared with the Home Office for it to pursue deportation investigations.",3
I am talking about data collected by teachers for learning being used for deportation.,3
The examples of malign hacking from overseas are countless.,2
"How do we deal with the risk of a benign UK company collecting data with consent—perhaps Tutor Hunt, which I referred to earlier—that is then acquired by an overseas company, which then uses that data free from the constraints of this legislation In the context of erasure, let me come to an end by saying that the Bill also allows for the right to be forgotten for children as they become 18.",3
New clause 53—Dealing with deficiencies arising from withdrawal in relation to child refugee family reunion— “(1) In the exercise of powers under section 7 (Dealing with deficiencies arising from withdrawal) the Secretary of State must in particular make regulations amending the Immigration Rules in order to preserve the effect in the United Kingdom of Commission Regulation (EU) No.,3
"604/2013 (establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person) (2) In particular, the regulations made under subsection (1) must provide for an unaccompanied minor who has a family member in the United Kingdom who is a refugee or has been granted humanitarian protection to have the same family reunion rights to be reunited in the United Kingdom with that family member as they would have had under Commission Regulation (EU) No.",4
"604/2013 (3) The regulations under subsection (1) must require an assessment of the best interests of the minor, taking into account possibilities for family reunification, the minor’s well-being and social development, safety and security considerations, and the view of the minor (4) Regulations under this section must be made within six months of this Act receiving Royal Assent (5) For the purpose of this section “family member” in relation to the unaccompanied minor, means— (a) their parents; (b) their adult siblings; (c) their aunts and uncles; (d) their grandparents.” This new clause is intended to provide for refugee family reunion in the UK in place of the family reunion aspects of the Dublin III Regulation, allowing adult refugees in the UK to sponsor relatives who are unaccompanied children to come to the UK from around the world.",3
"Amendment 332, page 6, line 11, at end insert— “(da) remove or reduce any rights available to unaccompanied child refugees or asylum seekers (including those who wish to claim asylum) concerning their admission or transfer to the UK under— (i) Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 (the “Dublin Regulation”); or (ii) Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States; (db) remove any rights or obligations derived from the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Treaty on the European Union, or the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which can be applied to the treatment of unaccompanied child refugees or asylum seekers (including those who wish to claim asylum) concerning their admission or transfer to the UK,” This amendment would prevent a Minister from using regulations under Clause 7 of the Bill to remove or reduce rights under the Dublin Regulation, the 2004 Directive on freedom of movement, or to remove rights or obligations under TFEU, TEU or the Charter of Fundamental Rights, regarding admission or transfer to the UK of unaccompanied child refugees or asylum seekers (including those who wish to claim asylum).",3
The scrutiny process envisages that the committee will make a recommendation as to the appropriate procedure in the light of draft regulations and other information provided by the Government.,3
"New clause 77—Co-operation with the European Union on violence against women and girls— “(1) Within one month of Royal Assent to this Act, and then once in every subsequent calendar year, the Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament a report on continued co-operation with the European Union on matters relating to violence against women and girls (2) That report must include, in particular, an assessment of how, following exit day, co-operation with the European Union will replicate mechanisms which exist within the European Union before exit day to— (a) maintain common rights for victims of domestic and sexual abuse when moving across borders, (b) reduce female genital mutilation (FGM), (c) reduce human trafficking, (d) reduce child sexual exploitation, and (e) enable data sharing relating to any of (a) to (d) (3) The first report made under subsection (1) following Royal Assent must— (a) include an assessment of the amount and nature of funding provided by European Union institutions to organisations based in the United Kingdom for the purposes of research, service provision, and other activity relating to ending violence against women and girls, and; (b) outline plans to provide comparable resources for research, service provision, and other activity relating to ending violence against women and girls in the United Kingdom.” This new clause calls for the Government to lay a report before Parliament laying out how cross-border action to end violence against women and girls will continue after exit day, assessing the extent of current European Union funding for work to end violence against women and girls, and setting out the Government’s plans to provide comparable resources.",3
"I will reflect on recent events, but noble Lords will be aware that there is a wide range of issues with security that we could consider, from civil emergencies to public health Although this debate focuses on the security situation in the UK, we are clear that in an ever more interconnected world, our security depends on addressing issues overseas and online.",3
"We have seen this with the rise of terrorist groups in Syria, Iraq and Libya, in the way that cyber criminals have targeted systems across the globe, and in the way that criminals are exploiting vulnerable people to perpetrate organised immigration crime and modern slavery The threats we face are global.",2
Daesh is currently the most significant terrorist threat globally and to the UK and our interests overseas.,2
Al-Qaeda’s ideology and organisation is a long-term threat to the UK and our interests overseas.,2
"Since February 2010, social media providers have removed 270,000 pieces of illegal terrorist material, following referrals from the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit But we must do better.",3
"It will work in communities, with the public sector and across society to promote and defend our values of democracy and the rule of law, of the freedoms of belief and expression, and of mutual respect, tolerance, opportunity for all and integration.",3
"Last week, the National Crime Agency produced its annual strategic assessment which shows that the scale of threats such as modern slavery and human trafficking is growing.",3
"Organised criminals are abusing online technology to defraud and extort, to facilitate the abuse of children, and to advertise the victims of human trafficking and modern slavery.",2
"Between April 2015 and March 2016, its work resulted in more than 3,000 arrests and 915 convictions, with 236 tonnes of illegal drugs seized, and £26 million in assets recovered.",3
It has galvanised the global effort to tackle this despicable crime Our economic and international status make us a target for criminal cyberactivity and for hostile foreign intelligence services.,3
"The National Cyber Security Centre, which began work in October last year, will work with law enforcement, the intelligence community and industry to make the UK the safest place to live and do business online Our border is a critical line of defence against threats to our national security.",3
The border provides us with a unique line of defence and an intervention point.,3
"There is a high level of collaboration between all common travel area members to strengthen the external CTA border, including use of passenger data and joint operational activity.",3
"This work is fully embedded into the work of our border security It is clear that there are real and persistent threats to our security, but we are committed to ensuring that our response to these threats adapts and evolves to meet them.",3
"And just as interior Ministers are following up on the online agenda we set at the G7, so finance Ministers will follow through on these G20 commitments to cut off the funding that fuels the terrorist threat we face I also called for the G20 to come together to better manage the risk posed by foreign fighters as they disperse from the battlefield in Syria and Iraq, and we agreed that we would work to improve international information-sharing on the movement of individuals known to have travelled to and from Daesh territory.",3
This includes ensuring refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach; improving the way we distinguish between refugees and economic migrants; and developing a better overall approach to managing economic migration.,3
It also includes providing humanitarian and development assistance to refugees in their home region.,3
"At this summit, the UK committed £55 million to support the Government of Tanzania in managing their refugee and migrant populations, and to support the further integration of new naturalised Burundian refugees Turning to modern slavery, it is hard to comprehend that in today’s world innocent and vulnerable men, women and children are being enslaved, forced into hard labour, raped, beaten and passed from abuser to abuser for profit.",3
"Of these, 22.5 million were seeking safety across national borders as refugees, which is the highest number since the UNHCR was founded in 1950 to deal with the tragic legacy of World War II.",3
"The biggest number of refugees is 5.5 million from Syria, followed by 3.3 million from South Sudan.",3
"At the end of last year, 2.8 million people were still seeking asylum.",3
"By far the largest number—over 80% of refugees—were in developing or middle-income countries, with some of the poorest countries hosting huge numbers: Turkey, 2.9 million; Pakistan, 1.3 million; and little Lebanon, 1.1 million, which is almost 20% of its population.",3
"Although being in the Schengen area has its advantages, as the noble Lord, Lord Ricketts, referred to, as the UK is outside this area we are, to some extent, shielded from the insensitive fumbling of the EU Commission, with its national quotas for refugees which have been largely ignored by the Schengen states Meanwhile, we should have the greatest sympathy for countries that have had their capacity to receive people overwhelmed by the numbers.",3
"Already, Italy has received more than 200,000 refugees—some 90% of them are still in emergency accommodation.",3
"Tragically, more than 1,600 refugees have lost their lives in the crossing this year.",3
"Stranded on the tiny Greek islands are 14,000 refugees, sometimes in very poor conditions.",3
Their passports should be cancelled and their citizenship revoked.,2
We cannot afford to take the risk and pay the price of doing otherwise We also need greatly to tighten our borders.,2
That must mean that the Passport Office should know much more about what passports other than British passports people hold.,3
She expressed astonishment that the Passport Office did not have a record of other passports that British passport holders held.,3
The Passport Office should also temporarily invalidate British passports held by anybody who is in prison or on bail.,3
That would mean automatic notification of instances such as that by the courts to the passport authorities.,3
There must also be automatic electronic cancellation of passports when death is notified to the registrar.,3
"At the moment, the trouble is that a lot of passports belonging to dead people drift around and are used by living people It is most important that there is an automatic recording of people when they leave the country, which should be kept for at least five years, as well as of people arriving.",3
"I do not know about other noble Lords, but when I first came back to London after the attacks, it felt like a very different London from that which I had left several weeks earlier The noble Lord and I have talked a lot about securing the border.",3
We adopt a rigorous approach to border security.,3
"As he knows, this includes effective working between agencies to manage the threat posed by terrorism, serious organised crime and immigration.",3
It includes specific briefings to those who work at the border on how to identify those potentially returning to the UK from conflict zones.,3
"It includes carrying out 100% immigration and security checks at the primary control point, advanced checks where available, and intelligence-led targeting at ports.",3
"We refused entry to nearly 9,000 EEA nationals; nearly 6,000 of these were stopped at our juxtaposed borders.",3
"In total, more than 116,000 people were refused entry to the UK, with nearly 30,000 of those stopped at the juxtaposed borders, to help keep us all safe The noble Lord has also talked to me on several occasions, and we have had several Questions in the House, about firearms and the effectiveness of the border.",3
"As he will know, the Home Office continually reviews the approach to border security.",3
"Border Force invested £68 million in technology and infrastructure in 2016-17, a 70% uplift on the previous year, to make our already secure borders even stronger.",3
"This is being led by the National Crime Agency and counterterrorism policy, and it is co-ordinating law enforcement activity to disrupt the supply of illegal firearms and to improve our understanding of the terrorist and organised crime threat in the UK and internationally The noble Lord asked about protective security and barriers.",3
She mentioned that the solution will not be a quick fix The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford talked about the unifying values the Government have envisaged.,3
"The Government are determined to cut off funding which fuels the evils of extremism in the UK, including from overseas, and will continue to work closely with our international partners to tackle the shared threat The noble Lord, Lord Ricketts, and the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, asked whether leaving the EU puts our national security at risk.",3
"We will seek a strong and close future relationship with the EU, with a focus on operational and practical cross-border co-operation.",3
"No decisions have been taken regarding how the UK will continue to co-operate with the EU on tackling cross-border crime and security threats, as this will be a matter for negotiation.",3
"There have already been several successful prosecutions for those who have returned from Syria, and this includes a 12-year custodial sentence for a British national who took part in terrorist training camps in Syria, and helped to create recruiting videos for Daesh My noble friend also asked about our taking Syrian returners’ passports away.",4
Section 40 of the British Nationality Act 1981 provides for the deprivation of British citizenship where the Secretary of State is satisfied that it is conducive to the public good and would not make an individual stateless.,3
Lady and I are as one on wanting to ensure that people legitimately entering the UK have an experience that is as swift and easy as possible when crossing the border.,4
"As a parent of six, I understand some of the additional challenges of travelling with small children, so I certainly do not underestimate the stress that that can cause, and our border system should not be doing anything to exacerbate that stress I am sure that the hon.",4
Member for Hampstead and Kilburn will agree that ensuring a smooth and swift passage through the border cannot be the only objective.,3
"It is equally important to carry out checks to ensure that those who cross the border are doing so lawfully and legitimately, which of course involves carrying out checks and a Border Force officer conducting an interview where any factors warrant further interest An important element of that—again, I am sure there is no difference between the hon.",3
"Of course, the vast majority of children who cross the border are travelling with one or both parents, often returning from a holiday, and there are absolutely no grounds for concern But, sadly, we cannot ignore the fact that there are cases that give rise to safeguarding concerns where children are taken across borders, be it because they are travelling without the consent of others, because of trafficking, forced marriage or abduction, or because they are travelling in contravention of a court order.",3
"Under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, all those concerned with the operation of the borders and immigration system have a statutory duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, which means they may stop anyone where they have reason to undertake further checks.",3
"The key point is that this duty would not change, nor should it, if parents’ names were to be included in children’s passports I understand why the hon.",3
"Lady makes these suggestions, and I can see why it appears attractive to provide information to border officials from a verified source.",3
"However, information in a passport can only reflect the situation at the point when the passport was issued.",3
"Children’s passports last for five years, and a lot can happen in that time.",3
"Information in a passport could rapidly become out of date and need to be replaced A passport, other than one that is brand new, even if it contains parents’ names, would not provide conclusive evidence to a Border Force officer that the person accompanying a child has the right to do so or is acting in the best interests of the child’s welfare.",3
Lady has proposed that HM Passport Office adds an observation to the child’s passport detailing parents or guardians with a surname different from the child’s.,3
"This information could be verified only at the time the passport was issued and, due to the ability to change names in the UK and overseas, and the fact that circumstances can change, this could rapidly become out of date.",4
"The point about observations is that they, like the core information in a passport, are designed to be about the individual and last for the lifetime of the passport The hon.",3
Lady may be aware that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office adds the name of the person with whom a child is travelling to an emergency travel document when it replaces a lost passport.,3
It certainly will not put me off my stride I was suggesting that the Government need to bring forward a debate on the Floor of the House on the basis for their immigration policy.,3
We need an evidence-based debate on the Floor of the House about immigration policy for the whole of the UK.,3
"If we have that, we will see that immigrants are on average more likely to be in work, better educated and younger than the indigenous population, and that Scotland’s demographic needs are such that we require a progressive immigration policy.",3
"As I said earlier, business in Scotland wants this; the Chambers of Commerce and the Institute of Directors in Scotland have said that they want the post-student work visa bought back, and a different immigration policy for Scotland, given its unique democratic needs.",3
"Let us have a debate about that, rather than about process Countries such as Canada and Australia manage to operate differential immigration procedures within their federation.",3
Professor Christina Boswell of the University of Edinburgh has produced an excellent report evaluating the options for a differentiated approach to immigration policy in Scotland.,3
"There is cross-party support in Scotland for the post-study work visa; even the Scottish Tory party supports its return, so what will the Tory MPs do about that, and when will we have a debate about it on the Floor of the House Another important issue from the last Parliament is the plight of child refugees in Europe.",3
"Public investment has been cut, services are under pressure, and that is leading to a sense of alienation—aggravated, I would suggest, by the conspicuous earnings and consumption of a few individuals and corporates at the top, who are beyond the reach of Governments, in some cases, being internationally footloose Into this ferment, populist and nationalist movements have found opportunity to exploit grievance and fuel anger.",3
What it may mean for immigration is even less clear.,3
"We will end free movement but continue to accept immigrants on our own terms, yet many—but by no means all—of those who voted to leave did so in the belief that we could halt or drastically reduce immigration.",3
"In America, restrictions are to be put on Muslim immigrants to the USA, millions of Mexicans are to be deported and a wall is to be built at the Mexicans’ expense.",3
How will we work with allies as we dismantle many established co-operative arrangements Two issues which can act as litmus tests on how we face the world relate to our overseas aid programme and our membership of the European Convention on Human Rights.,3
"As it is, the dramatic increase in spending on humanitarian relief in the wake of the Syrian refugee crisis and the conflict in Yemen have led to some cuts in forward development programmes, which are further hit by the fall in value of the pound and deteriorating trade balances between the UK and developing countries.",3
"It has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and spread political and economic freedoms The increasingly deep integration of trade, investment, people and information— otherwise described as globalisation—has been a particular feature of global growth during the past 25 years.",3
"These humanitarian catastrophes have put pressure on generous neighbours, aid agencies and the international system committed to giving a safe haven to refugees All these challenges are increasing the pressure on political systems, and raising fears for many that their children’s lives will be worse than their own.",3
"In my right honourable friend the Prime Minister’s words, we will be: “A confident global Britain that doesn’t turn its back on globalisation but ensures the benefits are shared by all” In a changing world, we can shape both domestic and foreign policy to help people be better prepared to deal with the challenges of rapid economic change This also means that we must be robust in countering the xenophobia that is a feature of some populist and nationalist rhetoric, while also recognising the balance that must be struck on immigration, to which so many noble Lords have rightly referred.",3
"However, we must ensure that the rate of immigration is at a pace which means that those arriving can be appropriately integrated into our communities Strengthening the rules-based international order and the institutions and values that underpin it remains the best way to ensure our collective security and prosperity, and to advance the UK interest.",3
Some outside this House have been tempted to draw early and potentially incorrect conclusions about the future direction of US foreign policy.,3
"A change in the US Administration invariably impacts on foreign policy, but the complex system of alliances and multilateral commitments which the US has supported since 1945, through different Administrations, is strong and enduring.",3
"We will continue to work closely with our European allies in foreign and security policy, and following our departure from the European Union we will champion open economies and free trade.",3
"We will continue to take a compassionate and pragmatic approach to global problems such as the migrant crisis, including supporting refugees in their region and seeking peaceful settlements in conflict-affected countries such as Syria, Libya and Yemen I am being reminded of the time.",3
"As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said, our proposals for frictionless trade across the Irish border have attracted major EU criticism.",3
"Not a penny should be paid in advance and, in the Commission’s own words, “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” Secondly, both sides must agree to treat existing immigrants of the EU 27 and the UK well, as the case may be.",3
"We need a guest workers’ scheme to help farming and a few other industries, with or without EU agreement, and we need continued access for the talented to secure the future of our financial, tech, research and international businesses However, we also have to recognise that the EU has failed to construct a proper border for third countries, especially across the Mediterranean.",3
"Indeed, Brexit was in large part the logical consequence of a succession of unfortunate drivers of immigration—the wars in the Middle East, social breakdown in North Africa, Chancellor Merkel’s encouragement of asylum seekers and the failure of our own referendum negotiators in 2016 to find a creative solution on the movement of people Thirdly, we need a transition period to ease the strain of adjustment on both sides, on issues ranging from financial services and border controls, to Euratom, telecoms, contracts and intellectual property.",3
Are the Government considering extending the new proposal for some form of identification card for immigrants from the EU to the majority of immigrants to this country who come from outside the EU?,3
Will that be in the forthcoming immigration Bill?,3
"It seems rather illogical to introduce this sort of scheme for people moving to this country from inside the EU but not for the majority of immigrants who, every year since we have worried about immigration, come from the rest of the world.",4
"Therefore, would it not be appropriate for the Government to propose a general scheme for foreigners within Britain—perhaps under something called the “Aliens Act”?",3
Last week the Leader of the House assured me that the Government are seeking urgent clarification from the Israeli authorities on the new law banning foreigners who call for the boycotting of illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.,3
"There has been a week of absolute silence from the Foreign Office on that issue and, on Monday, Hugh Lanning, chair of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, was the first UK citizen to be deported from Israel following the passing of that law.",3
May we please have a statement from the Foreign Office clarifying how the application of the law will affect UK passport holders and UK foreign policy?,3
"My Lords, I am moving this Motion because I believe the regulations on charges for overseas visitors do not clarify how up-front charging can work without increasing barriers to healthcare for very vulnerable groups.",3
"I also believe that it is a matter for further regret that these regulations have been introduced without sufficient checks of the effectiveness and value for money of the very bureaucratic process proposed Let me say at once that, on the face of it, charging overseas visitors to use our hard-pressed NHS is entirely reasonable.",3
The UK already charges some overseas visitors for most hospital care after treatment.,3
"Patients who are not eligible for free care include short-term visitors, undocumented migrants and some asylum seekers whose claims have been refused.",3
"Under the regulations that came into force last month, all community services receiving NHS funding, including charities and social enterprises, are now legally required to check every patient’s paperwork, including passports and proof of address, before they receive a service to see whether they should pay for their care.",3
"As a person will need to provide paperwork and/or a passport to prove eligibility, there is a distinct possibility that people who are entitled to free care on the NHS will be denied treatment because they do not have it at hand.",3
"Particularly vulnerable groups here include the elderly, asylum seekers, homeless people and mentally ill people.",3
The parents wondered if they had received the letter due to the mother’s foreign-sounding maiden name.,3
"The work done by Doctors of the World, which I have seen, has been researched comprehensively, and the fact is that many European countries, particularly the ones we tend to compare ourselves with, actually provide a more comprehensive package of free healthcare—for instance, to undocumented migrants I receive many briefings and letters from reputable organisations.",3
Many of them represent groups which will be intimately affected by the regulation introducing and extending overseas charges They are not the only ones to oppose this new policy.,3
"My Lords, the National Health Service is a cherished national institution, historically the envy of the world, and in theory none of us has a problem with overseas visitors using it.",4
"Unfortunately, it is not clear that we have the capacity to treat on the NHS all the overseas visitors that we would like to treat.",3
"Over the past four years the Government have prioritised improved cost recovery, and as a result we have achieved more than ever before, with identified income for the NHS from overseas visitors quadrupling from £89 million to £360 million.",3
"However, it should be recognised that £200 million of the £360 million comes from the immigration health surcharge, and in return 450,000 IHS visas are issued every year.",3
"Therefore, for £200 for immigrants and £150 for students—a subject that has been debated in this House—free NHS treatment is offered, without exclusion of pre-existing conditions, for nearly half a million people The regret Motion shows that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is concerned about racial profiling but, at the time of registration and to avoid any form of discrimination on arrival for a new hospital appointment, the same baseline question must be asked by an overseas visitor manager of every patient, in every department—using, according to the guidance, these exact words: “Where have you lived in the last 6 months?” If the patient replies “In the UK only”, no further questions are asked regarding residency or immigration status.",3
"The guidance issued by the NHS specifically excludes asylum seekers, trafficked people and every other variety of vulnerable grouping.",3
"Gentleman for his intervention, but say gently to him that between open-door immigration and closed-door immigration there seems to me to be quite wide scope for sensible reciprocal arrangements that allow us to retain control over the volume of immigration and things such as residency and welfare requirements, and to make sure that the people who come here are self-sufficient and that we have the security checks and deportation powers we need.",3
"Between cutting off all immigration and having open-door immigration, there is enormous scope for some sensible diplomacy I turn specifically to the amendments and new clauses.",3
"Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie) pointed out, the question of whether implementation would be phased and of transitional arrangements would become far more salient.",3
"It is probably illegal because there is no scope for a departing member, which has triggered article 50, to reverse its decision.",3
The amendment is probably beyond undemocratic and illegal; it is just plain tricksy.,2
"In the past, having the stated aim of making the UK a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants, the Government succeeded in making the UK a hostile environment for all immigrants, including foreign students and overseas workers in the National Health Service and social care, who no longer feel welcome.",3
"I dread to think what the proposed new immigration policy will contain Finally, we have the commission for countering extremism.",3
"The Federation of Small Businesses has asked for, to use their term, an employer-responsive immigration policy.",3
"I urge the Government to consult widely not only on their immigration policy following Brexit—the Minister referred to consultation—but on processes With regard to EU citizens, the Leader of the House yesterday promised, “a streamlined and high-quality service”.—[Official Report, 26/6/17; col.",3
"I believe that, because of the demands of Brexit, no additional staff are heading the Home Office’s way It would be logical, too, to take the opportunity to simplify our immigration law.",3
"We know the role played by immigrants in sustaining our economy, our NHS and our care services—one could go on—and, of course, that many do not feel valued in the current situation Our regard for people is reflected in our language.",3
"I shall say a word about language and Refugee Action’s campaign Let Refugees Learn, a campaign to improve language provision to refugees.",3
Being able to understand and make oneself understood is fundamental to integration.,3
Teaching English should be regarded as an investment in the often highly skilled and highly motivated people who seek asylum here.,3
"In the wide-ranging speeches, we had one great disappointment, and I am sure the Minister involved will know exactly what I am referring to; there has been no commitment at all to receiving the 20,000 Syrian refugees as promised by David Cameron.",3
Nor is there a commitment to increase the number of unaccompanied child refugees.,3
It has been a great disappointment in that direction We are probably going to get another immigration Bill; we get one every Session.,3
We can ask why asylum seekers are still refused permission to work for the first 12 months of their time in the United Kingdom.,3
"Why, also, do we have legislation that permits 18 year-olds to be deported?",2
Those who are deported are largely those who have had no access to legal advice.,2
"The Government could, quite easily I think, make a commitment that everyone who approaches 18 years of age shall at least have the benefit of top-rate legal advice There is one other thing I would like to see in the new immigration Bill.",3
"Anything that we can do to uprate that to the present cost of living would be very welcome I have come across a poem by Warsan Shire of Somalia that describes the circumstances, and I shall quote part of it: “You have to understand/that no one puts their children in a boat/unless the water is safer than the land No one burns their palms/under trains/beneath carriages No one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck/feeding on newspaper/unless the miles travelled meant something more than journey No one crawls under fences No one wants to be beaten/pitied No one chooses refugee camps/or strip searches where your/body is left aching/or prison/because prison is safer/than a city of fire … ” The accusation is that they have: “messed up their country and now they want to mess ours up” I could go on but I had better not.",4
"At the end of 2017, the British Council published a report on modern foreign language teaching in our schools and universities which listed Spanish, Mandarin, French, Arabic and German as the languages the UK will need most once we depart the EU.",3
Such hostility has caused foreign nationals to leave the UK while deterring others from coming here.,3
"That policy is particularly demonstrated by the Government’s senseless determination to include overseas students in the immigration figures, when in fact they make a decisive net contribution to this country There is already a shortage of modern foreign language teachers, yet the Government seemingly ignore the fact that currently around one-third of those in post are non-UK EU nationals.",3
"At a time when global connections matter more than ever, it is worrying that the UK is facing a languages deficit, because that restricts access by young people to overseas work experience, which is a vital part of preparation for them to develop a career in international business The threat to the ability of UK students to access the Erasmus+ programme after we leave the EU is an issue that the Government claimed that they would resolve through negotiation.",3
"The Government finally published their much-delayed immigration White Paper last month, and we know that free movement of EU nationals will end on 29 March.",3
"That will leave us with a single immigration system for all nationalities, with no cap on the number of skilled migrants.",3
But what is a skilled migrant?,3
"A supply of native speaker language assistants is crucial to the quality of higher education provision in modern foreign languages—a subject that is increasingly strategically important to national needs as the UK looks to engage more closely with the rest of the world Of disciplines which have the largest proportion of academic staff from the EU, modern languages, with 35%, is second only to economics with 36%.",3
This raises the crucial question of salaries and how these people will be affected by the Government’s new immigration regime when it is introduced in 2021.,3
"According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, 42% of all staff at universities earn less than £33,000 and 38% of academic staff earning below that figure are not UK nationals Analysis by the University and College Employers Association estimates that around 42% of technician roles in total fell below the tier 2 experienced worker threshold salary of £30,000 in 2016-17 and that the median basic pay of a language assistant in higher education is £26,000 These figures lay bare the extent of the damage that the Government’s new immigration rules could have unless the arbitrary £30,000 threshold is lowered significantly.",3
A supply of native speaker language assistants is crucial to the quality of higher education provision in modern foreign languages—a subject which is important to national needs as the UK looks to engage more closely with the rest of the world.,3
"Despite the difficulties, those that do still wish to work here may well be deterred or prevented from doing so by the bureaucracy that will accompany visa and work permit applications In closing, I want to put some questions to the Minister.",3
Are teachers of modern languages to be included in occupations that would qualify as tier 2 general visa applications?,3
"If they would not be regarded as being in suitable tier 2 general visa occupations, what will be the process for recruiting modern language teachers As in so much of the fraught debate around our departure from the European Union, it is a case of so many questions, so little time.",3
Friend relates to immigration and foreign national offenders.,3
"It is absolutely right to look at those cases where foreign national offenders, having been deported, are then brought back into the country, often illegally by criminal gangs.",3
"The issue that I have, though, is that, as a result of the proposals, we will potentially see more foreign national offenders in our prisons.",3
The issue of dealing with foreign national offenders in our prisons is faced by every Home Secretary when they come into office.,3
"I urge the Government, alongside what they are already doing, to consider how we can most effectively remove foreign national offenders and also ensure that we have prisoner transfer schemes to replace those that are available to us within the European Union On immigration, I note the many recent references to a points-based system.",3
"In 2010, when I became Home Secretary, one challenge that I faced was dealing with the abuse that had arisen in the immigration system, which had largely been enabled by the Labour party’s points-based system.",3
"It is possible that the best brains of the Home Office have come up with a very good scheme, but I urge the Home Secretary and the Home Office to look carefully at the lessons that have been learned about points-based systems, which are not in themselves an answer to controlling immigration and which can allow abuse to take place I am also concerned about some references in the press to what looked like, effectively, regional visas, or the ability for somebody to be given a visa if they were going to work in a particular part of the country.",3
"The Statement is as follows: “With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement about the number of migrants trying to cross the English Channel in small boats and what the Government are doing in response.",3
"Thankfully, there were no fatalities and I am pleased to say that all three victims have now been discharged from hospital Let me now turn to the issue of English Channel migrant crossings.",3
"Over recent weeks, we have seen a sharp increase in the number of migrants attempting to cross the Channel to the UK in small boats.",3
More than 500 migrants—mostly Iranian—attempted to travel to the UK on small vessels in 2018; 80% of them attempted this in the last three months of the year.,3
"In addition, just this morning, a dinghy was discovered just off the beach at Dungeness in Kent.",3
A number of individuals are now going through UK immigration procedures and one person has been arrested I am sure the House will want to join me in thanking all law enforcement agencies and all those involved in the response for their tireless efforts over Christmas and the new year.,3
The weather conditions are often treacherous and the inflatable boats being used are woefully ill equipped to make such dangerous journeys.,2
"The migrants who choose to make the trip are putting their lives in grave danger and can at times create dangerous situations for our rescue services The reasons behind the increased crossings are diverse—and, in many cases, outside our control.",3
"Thirdly, strengthened security at the French-UK border has meant it has become increasingly difficult for stowaways to illegally enter the UK in trucks and cars, leading to more reckless attempts by boat I have been very clear that robust action is needed to protect people and our borders and to deter illegal migration.",3
"As part of joint action agreed with the French, I have ordered two UK Border Force boats to be redeployed from overseas to patrol the Channel.",3
Last week I also requested additional help from the Ministry of Defence while we await the return of the two boats currently overseas.,3
"I welcome the action plan that the French outlined on Friday, which includes a commitment to increased surveillance and security in maritime areas, prevention campaigns in French coastal areas to stop people setting off in small boats in the first place, and a reinforced fight against smuggling gangs I am pleased to say that the National Crime Agency has also redoubled its efforts.",3
Last week two men were arrested on suspicion of the illegal movement of migrants.,3
"In addition, we are doing important work in the home countries of would-be migrants to reduce factors which compel them to make these dangerous journeys in the first place.",3
"We are also doing important work to undermine organised crime groups and we have committed £2.7 billion to the humanitarian response in Syria, making us the second biggest bilateral donor to the region We are also on track to resettle 20,000 refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria by 2020, as well as up to 3,000 of the most vulnerable in the Middle East and north Africa, including children at risk of exploitation and abuse.",3
"In 2017, the UK resettled more refugees than any other EU state under a national resettlement programme Let me reassure the House that I am continuing to monitor the issue of Channel crossings daily.",3
"The widely accepted international principle is that those seeking asylum should claim it in the first safe country that they reach, be that France or elsewhere.",4
"Indeed, this is what many asylum seekers do.",3
"Domestic legislation from 2004 clearly states that if an individual travels through a safe third country and fails to claim asylum, it will be taken into account in assessing the credibility of their claim.",3
"Following recent events, I have instructed my officials to look at how we can tighten this further and ensure that these provisions are working effectively Britain has a proud tradition of welcoming and protecting asylum seekers.",3
We also have a long history of accepting economic migrants—people like my very own parents.,4
Getting in a rubber dinghy is not.,3
Safeguarding lives and protecting the UK border are crucial Home Office priorities.,3
"Although we have obligations to genuine asylum seekers, which we will uphold, we will not stand by and allow reckless criminals to take advantage of vulnerable people.",3
"When you know a place well, as we both know Manchester Victoria station, these things become even more vivid in one’s mind This is an awful situation, but relatively small numbers are involved in the context of the international refugee position.",3
It talks about tackling criminal activity and says that trafficking puts lives at risk—as indeed it does—and we were told that one person has been arrested.,3
Was that for a trafficking or smuggling offence?,3
"I would be glad for confirmation that we are not talking about immigration detention here Of course one agrees with the Home Secretary that getting into a rubber dinghy is not safe, but we would much prefer the “safe and legal routes to sanctuary” formula, which is well known and widely used, rather than the “safe and controlled” formula, which seems to be a newly coined phrase.",3
"The UK has an obligation to consider all asylum claims properly and fairly and to grant asylum to those who are eligible, regardless of how they got here.",4
"Lady will have the opportunity to make her points in her speech, when I look forward to being able to interrogate her on some of them Somebody has said that this would be a smugglers charter—as if we do not have differential rates of VAT now.",3
We have differential rates of excise duty and different immigration systems.,3
"This House may be surprised to know that, believe it or not, the Garda Siochana—the Irish police force—and the PSNI, the Northern Ireland police force, do stop cars and public transport either side of the border and check the occupants’ passports.",3
We recently passed laws in relation to countering terrorism that gave them more powers at the border.,3
We have traffic cameras on the border.,3
"I beg to move, That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for certain asylum seekers to be granted permission to work; and for connected purposes Prior to my election as an MP, I worked for a number of years with refugees and asylum seekers who had fled violence and genocide in the former Yugoslavia.",3
"In my own constituency, we have a long history of welcoming refugees.",3
At a meeting in Muswell Hill led by Lord Alf Dubs—himself a refugee from Czechoslovakia who was brought to the UK in 1939 by the Quaker-led Kindertransport train—the audience was asked who among them had a family connection with refugees.,3
Nearly everyone raised their hand A group of my constituents runs Haringey Welcomes Refugees to provide a warm welcome for Syrian refugee families and to help with practical support and friendship.,3
"As I remember and reflect on the stories of those families, I am immensely proud that my first ever ten-minute rule Bill seeks to support asylum seekers by empowering them to rebuild their lives by allowing them to work and contribute to society I am pleased to have cross-party support for the Bill.",3
"Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell) for his work, most notably on the Syrian refugee crisis, and of course to the hon.",3
"Member for Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine), who presented her Bill on asylum seekers’ work rights on 10 January.",3
"I also pay tribute to the excellent work of the all-party parliamentary group on refugees, under the fantastic chairmanship of my hon.",3
"Friend the Member for Bristol West (Thangam Debbonaire), who leads a great coalition of supporters, as well as to the many charities and stakeholders who have really pushed on this issue Under the current rules, asylum seekers are able to apply for the right to work only after they have been waiting for a decision on their claim for over a year.",3
We have an effective ban on asylum seekers working.,3
"Just before Christmas, an old gentleman attended my surgery who had been waiting for a decision on his asylum application for over 12 years.",3
"He is in utter despair at a system that has forced him out of employment and into poverty for so many years Comparatively, the UK receives far fewer asylum applications than our European neighbours.",3
"In lieu of the right to work, asylum seekers can access a support payment of £5.39 per day.",3
"That allowance needs to cover clothing, transport, food, personal hygiene and often the cost of their asylum application.",3
"It also reduces the chances of smooth economic and social integration and, in doing so, causes longer-term problems The OECD has found that legal barriers to employment create the risk of people resorting to informal and sometimes illegal work, which can manifest itself in the form of modern slavery.",3
It is our duty to ensure that our asylum system is morally sound.,2
"Whether an asylum application is successful or whether it is ultimately rejected, we must remember throughout the process that the applicants are human beings with needs.",3
"There is strong public support for a change that provides refugees with the human dignity of being able to provide for themselves and their families Beyond the strong moral case, there is an equally compelling economic argument.",3
"Currently, we have around 11,000 adults who have waited more than six months for a decision on their asylum application.",3
"Assuming that an individual worked full time on the national minimum wage, they would pay a total tax and national insurance contribution of £1,400 into the Treasury In reality, we know that many asylum seekers are highly educated, with university degrees in the fields of law, pharmacy and optometry to name but a few, but those associated professions often fall outside the occupation shortage lists.",3
"He stated that it was the Government’s ambition “to build strong integrated communities where people—whatever their background—live, work, learn and socialise together, based on shared rights, responsibilities and opportunities.” That is an important statement of intent, which we can all agree to.",3
"The Home Secretary also indicated his desire to review asylum policy when he responded to my oral question in December 2018, and I hope that the Government will take forward my Bill’s proposal at the earliest opportunity Before concluding, as I still have a tiny bit of time on the clock and as it is half term, even though one would not think this was supposed to be a recess week with all the goings on, I thought that I would briefly read from a poem called “Changed” by Miss Grace Barry, a student at Our Lady of Muswell Hill Catholic Primary School, from the “Welcome to Haringey!",3
"With permission, Mr. Speaker, I will make a statement on the number of migrants trying to cross the English channel in small boats and what the Government are doing in response Before that, I know the whole House will want to join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to those injured in the attack at Manchester Victoria station on new year’s eve and to all those affected by that cruel and senseless act.",3
"Thankfully there were no fatalities, and I am pleased to say that all three victims have now been discharged from hospital Let me turn to the issue of the English channel migrant crossings.",3
"Over recent weeks, we saw a sharp increase in the number of migrants attempting to cross the channel to the UK in small boats.",3
"Over 500 migrants, mostly Iranian, attempted to travel to the UK on small vessels in 2018; 80% of them attempted this in the last three months of the year.",3
"In addition, just this morning, a dinghy was discovered along the Kent coast.",3
A number of individuals are now going through UK immigration procedures and one person has been arrested I am sure the House will want to join me in thanking all the law enforcement agencies and all those involved in the response for their tireless efforts over Christmas and the new year.,3
"This includes those from the Border Force, immigration enforcement, the coastguard, the National Crime Agency and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, many of whom I met in Dover last week.",3
"I would also like to thank our French law enforcement partners for their efforts to date, which have been collaborative, swift and thorough The English channel contains some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, the weather conditions are often treacherous and the inflatable boats being used are woefully ill-equipped to make such dangerous journeys.",3
"The migrants who choose to make the trip are putting their lives in grave danger, and they can at times also create dangerous situations for our rescue services The reasons behind the increased crossings are diverse, and in many cases are outside our control.",3
"Thirdly, strengthened security at the French-UK border has meant that it has become increasingly difficult for stowaways illegally to enter the UK in trucks and cars, leading to more reckless attempts by boat I have been very clear that robust action is needed to protect people and our borders and to deter illegal migration.",3
"I appointed a dedicated gold command, and I stepped up the UK’s response As part of joint action agreed with the French, I have ordered two UK Border Force boats to be redeployed from overseas to patrol the channel.",3
"Last week, I also requested additional help from the Ministry of Defence while we await the return of the two boats currently overseas.",3
"I welcome the action plan that the French outlined just this Friday, which includes a commitment to increase surveillance and security in maritime areas, prevention campaigns in French coastal areas to stop people from setting off in a boat in the first place and a reinforced fight against smuggling gangs.",3

"In 2017, the UK resettled more refugees under national resettlement schemes than any other EU state Let me reassure the House that I am continuing to monitor the issue of channel crossings daily.",3
"The widely accepted international principle is that those seeking asylum should claim it in the first safe country that they reach, be that France or elsewhere.",4
"Indeed, many asylum seekers do just that.",3
"Domestic legislation from 2004 clearly states that, if an individual travels through a safe third country and fails to claim asylum, it will be taken into account in assessing the credibility of their claim.",3
"Following these recent events, I have instructed my officials to look at how we can tighten this still further and ensure that these provisions are working effectively Britain has a proud tradition of welcoming and protecting asylum seekers and we have a long history of accepting economic migrants too—people like my very own parents—but all these routes need to be safe and they need to be controlled, which getting in a rubber dinghy is not.",3
Safeguarding lives and protecting the UK border are crucial Home Office priorities.,3
"While we have obligations to genuine asylum seekers, and we will uphold them, we will not stand by and allow reckless criminals to take advantage of vulnerable people.",3
"However, the whole House agrees that the public deserve the assurance that our borders are secure.",3
"One migrant making that dangerous crossing is one too many, but does he appreciate that some people might think that describing this as a major incident is an overstatement, when we consider that, at the height of the Mediterranean crisis, Greece was seeing hundreds of people a day landing on its beaches The Home Secretary is correct to make the point about the risk to human life.",3
"We know that ruthless people smugglers put desperate people in unseaworthy craft, with no one on board who is any type of seaman, and they distribute fake lifejackets—and all this in the busiest shipping lanes in the world.",3
These people smugglers are putting people’s lives at risk for mere financial gain.,2
"However, does the Home Secretary accept that there can be no question of turning back asylum seekers who have reached British waters?",3
"In this case, we are bound by the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees.",3
"Does he accept that under the convention, to which we are a signatory, refugees have a right to seek asylum here?",3
Taking the failure to claim in the first safe country into account is one thing; claiming that it entirely nullifies the asylum claim is quite wrong.,3
"Does he understand that it is not for him as Home Secretary, or anyone else, to claim that someone is not a genuine refugee without examining their case I welcome the increased co-operation with the French and the French action plan outlined on Friday.",3
"The important thing is not bellicose statements, but to stop people making dangerous crossings in the first place On the deployment of the Royal Navy, it seems to some that the Home Secretary was in some type of competition with the Defence Secretary as to who can appear more bellicose towards groups of Iranian refugees in their rubber dinghies.",3
How many of the people smugglers have been prevented and detained?,3
Let me try to tackle them in order This has nothing to do with the Brexit debate or the legitimate debate taking place around Brexit on future immigration and related issues.,3
This is all about protecting our borders and protecting human life: dealing with a situation here and now.,2
"In fact, when she was Home Secretary she did a great deal to deal with illegal migration, especially from France.",3
"First, there has been a significant increase in the number of crossings using small boats across the English channel.",3
Lady may think—maybe it is suggested through her question—that 543 attempted crossings is not very much relative to the total number of asylum claims every year.,3
"It is one of the reasons, alongside protecting the border, why this is a major incident.",2
I do not think anyone in this House would want to be in a position knowing that the Government have not done everything they reasonably can to protect human life as well as our borders I gently ask the right hon.,3
This is about protecting human life and protecting our borders Let me turn to the other questions the right hon.,3
"On the first safe country principle, she mentioned the 1951 refugee convention.",3
It is a principle indirectly supported through the new global compact for migration and the global compact for refugees.,3
"Very importantly, it is a principle at the heart of the EU’s own common European asylum system.",3
"In the 2005 procedures directive, it is explicitly stated that an asylum seeker should claim asylum in their first safe country, otherwise it can be declared inadmissible if it is claimed in another country.",3
"The whole point of the Dublin regulation is that if someone has passed through another EU safe country, it is expected that they claim asylum first there.",4
Lady asked me about the other activities in which the boats that I have asked to come back to the UK are involved.,3
The Royal Navy is supporting while we fill the gap until those boats return.,3
This draft instrument makes provision for separated migrant children to be eligible for legal aid for civil legal services for non-asylum immigration and citizenship matters.,3
"For in-scope matters and ECF, legal aid eligibility is subject to statutory means and merits assessments Under current arrangements, separated migrant children seeking to regularise their immigration or citizenship status in the United Kingdom can apply for exceptional case funding to receive legal aid for help with their citizenship application, immigration application form or subsequent appeal.",3
This means that separated migrant children will no longer have to make ECF applications to receive legal aid for citizenship and non-asylum immigration matters I turn to the scope of the amendment.,3
"The amendment makes provision for separated migrant children to be eligible for civil legal services in relation to their immigration applications for entry clearance, leave to enter and leave to remain in the United Kingdom under the Immigration Rules.",3
The amendment also provides civil legal services in relation to separated migrant children’s immigration applications for leave to remain where that application is made and determined outside of the Immigration Rules.,3
"This would include applications for discretionary leave to remain and leave to remain on medical grounds, as well as exceptional circumstances or compassionate or compelling factors, which may warrant a grant of leave outside the immigration rules Further, legal aid will be available to these children in relation to relevant applications for entry clearance, leave to enter or leave to remain made under the Immigration Rules by another person, including family members and extended family members, and granted either under or outside the Immigration Rules.",3
"This amendment includes legal aid applications for registration as a British subject or citizen, a British Overseas Territories citizen, and a British overseas citizen Some amendments relate to the procedures for applying for different forms of civil legal services.",3
"The changes ensure that, for controlled work and licensed work, separated migrant children who require legal representation in proceedings before a court or tribunal covered by this regulation will be able to receive it.",3
"The changes ensure that the tests applied to immigration matters currently in scope of legal aid are also applied to this regulation This instrument takes a normative definition of a “child”, being any person under 18 years.",3
"Following this Statement, the Legal Aid Agency advised legal aid providers of interim amendments to the exceptional case funding guidance for applications made by, or on behalf of, separated migrant children for citizenship and non-asylum immigration matters.",3
"The guidance outlined reduced evidence requirements when making an application and that ECF caseworkers will operate on the basis that there is a strong presumption that separated migrant children require legal aid To conclude, the draft regulation before us today makes important changes to the scope of legal aid to bring citizenship and non-asylum immigration matters into scope of legal aid for separated migrant children.",3
"Credit is also due to members of the Refugee and Migrant Children’s Consortium, who worked with the Children’s Society and the Government to ensure that this SI came into being, making good on the Government’s promise, given by Lucy Frazer MP, which was the basis on which the Government settled the Children’s Society’s case I can do no better in summarising the existing position and the reason for change than to quote from the statement of facts and grounds submitted by the Children’s Society’s legal team, led by Paul Bowen QC, with the consent of Mr Bowen: He says: “Where such children are involved in non-asylum immigration matters, with the very limited exceptions, these matters are currently considered ‘out of scope’ for the purposes of Section 9 of LASPO, and so will only be funded if an Exceptional Case Funding … determination has been made pursuant to Section 10 of LASPO These children are among the most vulnerable individuals in the country.",3
They are at a heightened risk of abuse and exploitation as a result of their immigration status.,2
The potential immigration processes and proceedings they face in an attempt to regularise their status in the UK are extremely complex.,3
"The consequences for these children if they do not or are unable to negotiate these processes and/or proceedings are fundamental and life-changing, ranging from a lack of access to further education, social services and healthcare to deportation.",3
"This is unlawful for the reasons summarized in the argument” The Children’s Society rightly claims that it securing this change was, “a significant achievement as so far it is the only cohort the government has agreed to bring back into scope for legal aid” It wrote that: “The change all our supporters and partners helped bring about will have huge implications for thousands of children who need this vital support”— I repeat the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, about the numbers affected—and that: “It will ensure they can once again access the legal aid they so desperately need to live full and settled lives” I also quote from paragraphs 34 and 35 of the Government’s impact assessment, which state that: “Separated migrant children have distinct vulnerabilities and needs, which can be made worse by uncertainty in their immigration status.",3
"Further, if children do not resolve their immigration status during childhood, they can become ineligible for certain public services (like being able to work, find housing or continue with education) when they turn 18 … It is expected that professional legal advice from legal aid immigration solicitors on non-asylum immigration matters will help to ensure more robust initial decision making because the original application should make the best possible case, improving the quality of applications and appeals to the Home Office” This case is absolutely overwhelming, so the Government must acknowledge that this change was long overdue and that the litigation should never have been contested, as it was for some time In welcoming this SI unreservedly, I remind the House that it is significant that this crucial reform was forced on the Government by judicial review.",3
The review involved the courts considering a decision on judicial review as to whether the power in Section 9(2) of the LASPO Act should be used so as to bring unaccompanied and separated children’s immigration cases into the scope of LASPO.,3
"The UK and the EU will provide visa-free travel, but only for short-term visits; both parties will consider visa conditions for research, study, training and youth exchanges; both parties will consider addressing social security co-ordination; both parties will consider measures to minimise border checks; both parties will seek to co-operate on parental responsibility measures; and there will be a framework to enable people to travel temporarily to the other territory for business purposes.",3
"However, the rest of the immigration process, just like the rest of Brexit, is left hanging I am interested in what the Minister can say; clearly, he may not be able to say it directly.",3
"When it comes to the impact of economic migrants from the EEA, the committee finds that, overall, there is, “no evidence that EEA migration has reduced employment opportunities for UK-born people on average”, and that overall there is, “no evidence that EEA migration has reduced wages for UK-born workers on average” The committee notes that there is: “Evidence that immigration has, on average, a positive impact on productivity”, and: “High-skilled immigrants increase innovation” I remind your Lordships that those two issues of innovation and productivity are key objectives of the Government’s Industrial Strategy.",3
"The committee also notes that EEA migrants, “make a larger contribution both in terms of money and work to the NHS than they receive in health services”, and that there is: “No evidence that migration has reduced the quality of healthcare” Quite the contrary, I would say.",3
The committee noted that EEA migrants pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits for public services.,3
"However, and tellingly, the committee is also not convinced that sufficient attention is paid to ensuring that the extra resources that have come in from those migrants is being spent in the areas where they live.",3
"In pointing out that only a very small fraction of migrants occupy social housing, the committee also pointed out that, given that virtually no new social housing was being built, any migrant in social housing is excluding a UK-born tenant.",3
"For my part, it is clear that the woeful performance in housebuilding by successive Governments is a much larger irritant on the housing issue in this country than migrants.",3
"The evidence points to the need not to stop the beneficial flow of economic migrants but for targeted government investment in the communities that have generally been termed to have been left behind As the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, so eloquently put it in his speech during our debate before Christmas, these communities will not be benefited by making Britain poorer, and one way to make the UK poorer is to end free movement.",3
It is fair to say that there is a huge cognitive dissonance between the published evidence of the Migration Advisory Committee and the political declaration and immigration White Paper.,3
"Worse than that, in justifying their policies, they vilify that group for issues that are caused by government mistakes and mismanagement The immigration White Paper makes clear distinctions between what are termed skilled and unskilled workers—here we come to the point raised just now by the noble Lord, Lord Liddle.",3
"Yes, it makes the process of applying for tier 2 visas easier by proposing to abolish the 270,000 annual cap and the resident labour market test, which was a heavy administrative burden on businesses trying to hire from overseas.",3
"In the interim, the Government will allow unskilled workers to apply for temporary, 12-month visas.",3
"High-skilled workers may be contributing more in tax, but lower skilled migrants are offering a huge contribution in the services they offer to this country.",3
"Once we start looking for sectors that might need such schemes, frankly, we can include the vast majority of the UK economy, but given that agriculture and the hospitality industry are two important parts of our international trade, perhaps the Minister can explain what volume of work-related immigrants the Government anticipate being admitted and how that equates to the stated needs of those two industries I am also anxious to learn the Government’s view on how self-employed people or freelancers will trade across the EU-UK border.",3
We have to remember that they came here in good faith under passports which indicated to them that they were indeed British.,4
"It is a scandal to which the Government were initially slow to react and it is a scandal in which some Members of Parliament deliberately muddied the waters with talk of illegal immigrants, when, by definition, none of the Windrush victims is here illegally.",3
Her successor as Home Secretary was obliged to relinquish her post because she incorrectly told the House that there were no numerical deportation targets.,3
Member for Hastings and Rye (Amber Rudd) had written to the Prime Minister promising to increase deportations by 10%.,3
"We also know that deportation numbers were a key performance indicator when she presided over home affairs, and that Home Office officials received bonuses relating to the numbers of deportees.",3
"The current Home Secretary told the House in April last year: “I will do whatever it takes to put it right” He also said: “We have made it clear that a Commonwealth citizen who has remained in the UK since 1973 will be eligible to get the legal status that they deserve: British citizenship.”—[Official Report, 30 April 2018; Vol.",3
"We know that many citizens from the Commonwealth who have been here since 1973 have still not been granted British citizenship and are still not treated as British citizens On this side of the House, we welcome the fact that the compensation scheme will be open to the estates of deceased Windrush generation persons and also to their relatives.",3
"This is despite the fact that these legal costs, which are easily documented, were incurred in challenging wrongful loss of jobs, deprivation of public services including the NHS, loss of home, wrongful detention and wrongful deportation.",3
"One of my early speeches when I was a new Member of Parliament was made during a debate on immigration, facilitated by the right hon.",3
"I wanted to speak in that debate because immigration had been prevalent in the run-up to, and during, my 2010 election campaign, and it continues to be of interest today In that speech, just over eight years ago, I focused on the fact that our British sense of tolerance and generous manner, which had welcomed many to our country for hundreds of years, had been overstretched and taken for granted during uncontrolled immigration under the last Labour Government.",3
"I referred to the impact of mass eastern European immigration in my own constituency—particularly in the two most deprived wards, where at the time tensions ran high and social divisions deep.",3
"The years since have passed with highs and lows, but, although integration is undoubtedly better, there remain enormous challenges, including the stretching of public services, the sudden change in population, and the perceived unfairness that free movement bought entitlement to welfare and housing structures that others did not have However, the debate, then as now, was balanced and constructive.",3
"It is a symbolic but important announcement, which shows that we appreciate them and what they have brought to our country I support the Bill because it will enable us to deliver a future immigration system that is right for our country, not one that suits the political ambitions of the European Union.",3
"Although the Bill itself will not set out the specifics, the immigration rules will.",3
"The Government have rightly noted that they need to command the confidence of the public and reflect the wider economic, social and political context of immigration I think that we are all to blame for the public’s loss of faith in the immigration system.",3
"I shall try to put this as sensitively as possible, but we have allowed asylum seekers and refugees to be confused with economic migrants: we have allowed people to think that they are one and the same.",3
I am confident that the immigration rules will enable that to happen.,3
What has been said so far has demonstrated the breadth and depth of the issues surrounding immigration.,3
I do not want people to think that I am being shallow in raising one rather niche issue relating to immigration.,3
"Given that you can take the girl out of the sports Ministry but cannot take the sports Ministry out of the girl, I am sure many Members will not be surprised to learn that I want to make a brief point about the connection between the future immigration rules and football Because we are friends, and because I have no doubt bored the Immigration Minister to tears with sports stuff over the years, I know she understands that football is not just about people running around on a pitch kicking a ball; I know she “gets” the fact that the Premier League and the English Football League bring a phenomenal amount of money to our economy.",3
"The impact of that is clear from England’s most recent World cup results—and ours was the only national team 100% of whose players came from their home league Other European leagues are licking their lips in the belief that Brexit will present them with a recruitment and competitive advantage over the Premier League, and that, post-Brexit, the Premier League will have to work within an immigration system that presents hurdles to the recruitment of the world’s best talent, both within the EU and outside it.",3
"The last thing that Brexit should be is a gift to leagues that, despite already having far fewer visa requirements for players, have so far been unable to match the popularity of the Premier League on equal terms.",3
"Members for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell) and for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis) in their interventions on the Home Secretary, which is the question of immigration detention This Bill repeals the law relating to free movement, thereby bringing EEA nationals and their families within general immigration control and requiring them to have leave to enter and remain under the Immigration Act 1971.",3
"Everyone now acknowledges that terrible mistakes were made by the Home Office and that people who have been here for years were wrongfully detained as illegal immigrants If we are to subject 3 million EU citizens to our immigration system, it is right that we should now ask ourselves whether we have learned the lessons of the Windrush cases so that we do not repeat those injustices on EU citizens.",3
"We do not want the new level playing field to be a detention centre I have the privilege of chairing the Joint Committee on Human Rights and, following our inquiry into immigration detention, we are clear that two problems need to be addressed.",3
"If the police want to continue to detain a person beyond 36 hours, they have to bring that person before a court, which is, of course, totally independent of Government But if the Home Office suspects a person of being in breach of our immigration laws, there is a complete absence of independence in the decision making.",3
"The first that person will know about it is when someone bangs on their door in the early hours of the morning to bundle them into an immigration enforcement van and take them to a detention centre With no independence in the decision making, and with no scrutiny or accountability, mistakes are inevitable.",3
It should not be the case that a person has fewer protections from wrongful detention as an immigrant than they would if they had actually committed a crime.,2
"The Joint Committee on Human Rights will table an amendment to that effect, and we hope the Government will agree to it Another deplorable aspect of our immigration system, to which EU citizens are now to be subject under this Bill, is that there is no time limit on detention.",3
"Evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights identified the indefinite nature of such detention as one of its cruellest aspects The criminal justice system imposes time limits at every stage, from first bringing a defendant before a magistrate to the sentence that sets out their time in prison, but the Home Office can hold a person in immigration detention indefinitely.",3
"Friends the Members for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn) and for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) that there should be a time limit of 28 days on immigration detention, and the Joint Committee will table an amendment to the Bill so that if a detainee is not deported or released by then, they should be brought before a judge where the Home Office can apply for just a further 28 days.",3
I remain deeply affected and humbled by meeting parents in refugee camps who took appalling risks to shield their children from horrific danger.,3
Perhaps the Government do not want much scrutiny of their record on refugees Let me tell the House what this Bill could do if it were to follow Britain’s proud humanitarian tradition.,3
"At the moment, asylum seekers are barred from working.",3
"They cannot even earn to take care of their own families, and that makes it harder to integrate and harder to play a part in their own communities and economies—the very things that help every community to thrive.",2
"If asylum seekers do not get a decision after three months, let us lift this ludicrous ban, and let them work and contribute.",3
"At the moment, immigrants can be detained with no idea of when they might be removed or released.",3
"I have a private Member’s Bill, the Refugees (Family Reunion) Bill, before this House that would reunite refugee children with their parents.",3
"Yet last year’s immigration White Paper suggests that we ban all migrants who earn less than £30,000 because apparently they will not have sufficient skills.",3
"I am aware of the time limit, so I am afraid I will not give way This immigration system’s design should have learned and inwardly digested the lessons from the Windrush system.",3
"It should have involved the nation—leavers and remainers, those concerned about immigration and those concerned that it treats neither long-term legal migrants nor newly arrived people fleeing persecution well—in discussing what a new immigration policy should be and how it should operate.",3
"This is in the wake of an immigration scandal in which other people who had legally made their lives here, contributed to their communities, raised children, worked hard, paid taxes and helped their neighbours were made to feel unwelcome and told to go home.",3
The Home Secretary says that this is the start of a national conversation about our immigration system.,3
"As the result of the EU referendum has so many times been identified as closely tied with concerns about immigration, surely this conversation should have started in 2016.",3
"This Bill should have been introduced in the concluding stages, not the starting stages, of a national debate When people’s worries about immigration—whatever their motivations—are not dealt with, there are serious consequences.",3
"People who think that there should be more controls grow resentful if they feel their concerns are ignored, and they feel alienated from a political system that they rightly think should serve them.",3
"They may feel that they are labelled as racists, which they may also feel is unfair, and that does not help their feeling of alienation.",3
It is not a context in which good immigration policy is created My constituents in Bristol West often write to me about migration.,3
They never tell me to help refugees or Windrush victims or EU citizens less.,3
They campaign to stop indefinite detention of migrants.,3
"We would not feel it was right that we were kept on a subsistence allowance, yet left with the blame for a system that is rooking the taxpayers as well as not serving us Our asylum system is flawed.",3
"In a report published in 2017, the all-party parliamentary group on refugees, which I chair, put forward many recommendations that I beseech the Home Secretary and Immigration Minister to look at again.",3
"It could have provided the framework for an immigration system that we could all put our trust in, but it does not.",3
"It misses by a mile the vision and values that our country’s immigration system should have been built on—British values of tolerance, openness and fair-mindedness This Bill could have been the nourishing meal that gave us what we needed to get through the economic woes of Brexit, which I still hope we will not have to suffer.",3
"It sticks slightly in the craw of a person who grew up in Birmingham to listen to people, who do not live among migrants and who do not live in diverse places, talk about how difficult it is for communities who have to live in places of high migration.",3
It is a total pleasure to live among migrant communities.,3
He believes he may be the only person in the entirety of Birmingham not to have heritage elsewhere that allows him a passport in these testing times.,3
"I have spoken many times to the Immigration Minister about the real, deep-seated concerns I have about immigration: certain misuses of spousal visas, situations where we are not preventing problems such as forced marriage, and other issues that really need to be addressed.",3
"I see some of the worst elements of our immigration system, both on the part of the Home Office and on the part of the people who wish to abuse it.",2
"I am not here to say that everything is perfect, everything in the garden is rosy, and that we should just open our borders and let everybody in.",3
"I will, through the various channels in this House, be seeking special immigration status for women and any victim of domestic and sexual violence.",3
Those on one side of the House have far less experience of working with the immigration system and its pitfalls than those of us on the Opposition Benches.,3
I imagine that I do more immigration casework in one day than some Conservative Members do in an entire year.,3
It is only right that this place is the place of scrutiny for immigration.,2
I am reminded of a trip we took together last year to the United States when one of the last things we did was visit the State of Massachusetts’ refugee and immigration programme.,3
"It had some interesting ideas for both supporting refugees and making them valuable members of society, including by finding them jobs.",3
"We might want to learn from that Let me start by expressing an interest in the subject of immigration, as the husband of an immigrant, but an immigrant from outside the European Union.",4
"Before I came to the House, my wife and I began to be experts in the immigration process.",3
"I welcome not only the Bill but the 12-month consultation with business and services throughout the United Kingdom, which should set the country on course for a truly fair immigration system that reflects the country’s priorities Let me also compare my view with that expressed by the hon.",3
"Scottish Conservative Members share an understanding of the issues faced in Scotland by industries such as fisheries and agriculture, and the problem of the shortage of skilled labour at home and its availability overseas.",3
"We may simply differ in regard to the solutions that we envisage In June 2016, 17.4 million people in the United Kingdom—including, it is estimated, the majority of voters in Banff and Buchan—voted to leave the European Union, and there can be no denying that a desire to take back control of our borders was one of the many reasons for that vote.",3
"I also believe that it marks another necessary step towards a new immigration system: a system that we control, a system that is fair to people from all countries, and a system that is skills-based and tailored to our economy, society and public services.",3
"First, may I draw the House’s attention to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests in relation to research support I have received in my office for work on immigration matters?",3
"Members around the House for taking action on indefinite immigration detention, which I think we can all agree is an obscene reflection on our current system It has been a pleasure to hear so many Members from around the House speaking so positively of the contribution and value immigrants have brought to our country over so many years, and it is true in my constituency, too: we are proud to be home to so many diverse communities, and I hope that the message that has gone forth from the House tonight to those who are here now or who might be considering making their home here in future is, “You will be welcome; you will be valued members of our community; and we will make sure that during your time spent in this country, you will be looked after well and can be happy.” This Bill is very light on detail, yet it offers very wide powers to Ministers to implement all sorts of potential changes via immigration rules.",3
"While I appreciate that that is the way that many immigration changes are brought in already under our present system, the Bill’s ending of free movement represents a seismic change in our system that I believe—and I think this belief is widespread—ought to be subject to careful parliamentary scrutiny We also know that our existing immigration system, which is presumably to be transplanted across in some degree to EEA nationals in future, is already flawed, and we have rightly heard tonight about Windrush.",3
"I would also highlight the recent DNA debacle, which we do not want to be replicated for future immigrants coming to this country, as we fear We are pleased that the Government have asked the Law Commission to look at how immigration rules might be simplified, but it seems premature or, indeed, inconsistent to ask it to do so while asking us to give powers to Ministers to make ongoing changes that the commission will not be able to take account of.",3
"The Henry VIII powers in this Bill are very inappropriate in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, especially in the light of the direction of travel laid out in the White Paper and in particular, as we have heard again and again tonight, the very significant concerns about the £30,000 income threshold to assess whether a migrant has the skills to mean that we would want them to make their home here.",3
"Friend the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), the shadow Home Secretary, about the Government’s proposal for short-term work visas.",3
"These have some place in an immigration system, but on a large scale they will be inefficient for employers, create insecurity for individuals, damage family solidarity since family members will not be eligible to come in with those on short-term visas and damage community cohesion and integration.",2
"I particularly say to the Minister that there is a serious risk of the exploitation of vulnerable migrant workers on these short-term visas, as well as the risk that they will undercut UK workers if unscrupulous employers choose to take advantage of this system We will need strong protections at the very least to support a short-term workers visa scheme, yet today our labour market inspectorate is not well resourced.",3
"There is great concern about Ministers’ ability to make immigration rules that might increase the vulnerability of those workers without full parliamentary scrutiny The Bill will allow Ministers to change rules on social security co-ordination, which is important in facilitating employment mobility.",3
"I hope that the Minister will categorically rule out any possibility that the Government would in future unilaterally withdraw the ability to aggregate and passport pension and social security rights in the event of no deal or after the transition period I also want to express concerns for those who do not or cannot regularise their status, including some of those applying for settled status, or those who might become irregular in future, perhaps as overstayers.",3
"I hope that tonight the Minister might commit to relaxing or at least looking at relaxing the exceptional circumstances criteria set out in the 2012 immigration rules changes, so that families with dependants under the age of 18 have access to the public funds they need There are also concerns about the cost of regularising one’s status and the complexity of the process.",3
"There is great worry that that ratio might increase in future as more vulnerable individuals make their applications I am concerned about exceptionally high fees and repeat fees for those who will not be applying for settled status, such as those who might arrive in future and will then go on to the 10-year path to citizenship.",3
"For example, a child with a claim to British citizenship should be able to make that claim in their own right and not be expected simply to be reliant on the lower settled status that might be available to their parent.",3
"That is one reason why, if the Bill does go into Committee, I will be looking to support amendments that remove the threshold, so that we can have a skills-based system rather than an arbitrary salary threshold There are also severe problems with the 12-month visa scheme, and there are all sorts of issues relating to the protection of workers’ rights, which are another fundamental root cause.",3
It is not a question of immigration undermining wages and working conditions in this country; it is the fact that organised labour has been under systematic assault by this Government for many years.,2
It is not about immigration The swathe of Henry VIII powers that the Government seek to usurp from Parliament in favour of the Executive is extremely sinister and unacceptable.,3
"If the Bill receives its Second Reading tonight—I hope it does not, but it may well—that must be challenged in Committee The whole notion of an arbitrary cap on migrants panders to the worst sort of stereotypes and ought to be stopped.",3
"and learned Friend the Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), to introduce a 20-day limit to immigration detention.",3
The system needs to be changed It is about not just the economic aspects but the opportunities denied because of our asylum system.,2
"I have met doctors, surgeons, lawyers and chemists in my constituency who are all denied the opportunity to work in or contribute in any meaningful way to our society, because under our current asylum policy they are not able to work so are kept in limbo for years at a time.",2
I have had to deal with more than 100 asylum cases in the past five months alone because of the Home Office’s failures to expedite those cases efficiently.,3
"I find it tragic when 18-year-olds are unable to take up a place to study law at university in Glasgow because they cannot get student finance because their immigration or asylum status has not been determined, or when champion boxers who want to represent Scotland internationally are unable to go abroad to fight in competitions because their asylum status has not been settled.",3
"With the existing asylum contracts coming to a close in 2019, we learned that Serco, which had the asylum accommodation contract in Glasgow, was seeking to move on asylum seekers at a much faster rate than usual.",3
"I would support measures to extend the period to give asylum seekers the right to assess where they are at the end of a process and to consider their right to appeal, without the threat of being turfed out on to the streets.",3
"The current immigration policy of this Government threatens to undo all that hard work to reverse Scotland’s population decline Having worked in Scottish enterprise, promoting initiatives such as the ScotGrad scheme, which has brought in international graduates and foreign language students to help promote Scottish exports abroad, I can say that the policy is a real threat to the future economic prosperity of this country.",3
The notion of a temporary 12-month work visa for these people is abhorrent.,2
How can we expect such people to integrate into the local community?,3
"I accept that immigration was an issue, but I asked the Home Secretary at the beginning of the debate whether he thought people were voting on immigration or on free movement of labour.",3
"Many people did vote on immigration—not necessarily the majority, and not even the majority of leavers—and it was an issue, but the idea that the referendum came down to free movement of labour is nonsense It is worth remembering what some of the Conservative Brexiteers were saying at the time.",3
"Daniel Hannan MEP, one of the leading Tory Brexiteers, said the day after the referendum result: “Frankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the EU, they are going to be disappointed.” He also said: “The idea of staying within a common market but outside the political integration, I think that is feasible” For his punchline, this arch-Conservative-Brexiteer said: “It means free movement of labour.” When we are told that the referendum gave a mandate for this Bill, it is simply not true, and the House should not stand for it, because many Brexiteers, including one of the chief ones, said during the referendum that it did not.",3
"Just to show that the Government are totally inconsistent and totally incoherent, on page 84 of “The NHS Long Term Plan” there is the wonderful phrase: “The workforce implementation plan will set out new national arrangements to support NHS organisations in recruiting overseas.” You could not make this nonsense up, and the Government should be ashamed of themselves.",3
"There are so many things wrong with the immigration system—there are no limits on detentions and there is a ban on asylum seekers working, and there is the complete incompetence and incoherence in the Home Office, as I see in my two surgeries every week when I meet people who are the victims of that incompetence—and there is so much to be done, but the Bill does nothing to solve those problems.",3
"The immigration system is not fit for purpose, and the Bill will make it worse and unfair.",2
"Even if the process will be “simple and easy”, it fails to address honestly the open border in Northern Ireland; we will, of course, end up having a diverging EU immigration policy within the island of Ireland.",3
"It fails to give reassurances to visitors who may come to the UK but want to change their status, and it might mean that they have to do the same ridiculous run around that non-EU migrants have to do when they have to leave the country of reapplying through a different immigration system and come back in.",3
"The system is currently farcical for non-EU migrants, and the Bill will introduce that farce for EU citizens as well.",3
Have we learned nothing from Windrush or the disregard with which the Government treat many migrants?,3
"I would not trust this Government—in fact, I would not trust many Governments—with the right to decide on immigration without being fettered by Parliament.",3
"They cannot be allowed to deny EU citizens their rights in this way Of course, things have got so bad generally with immigration.",2
"When I write to the Immigration Minister about immigration issues, she does not bother writing back to me; she gets a civil servant in the liaison team to send me a bog-standard, pro forma letter.",3
"That is what the Minister has come to, and that is what the Government have come to—dispassionate about individual issues, worrying only about the number on the visa or the number of migrants.",3
"He was an EU citizen, but despite spending £1,000 on an immigration lawyer to fill in the paperwork, the Government said that the right boxes had not all been ticked.",3
"They will now have to fulfil all the immigration checks, even though they see Britain as their homeland.",3
"I was granted EU citizenship in 1992, as were most of us.",4
I fail to see why people who were born with citizenship rights should suddenly have them taken away.,2
"Is that good enough First, the Bill is not a blueprint for a new immigration system, but a blank cheque.",3
The White Paper on immigration is not a final draft; it is out for a 12-month consultation.,3
"The Secretary of State could use the powers in the Bill to introduce an immigration system that is entirely different from anything that has been discussed without parliamentary oversight or scrutiny If the Government go with what is in the White Paper, that would spell disaster for our economy and our society.",3
"The suggested short-term visa route would open the door to widespread labour abuses, creating a second class of migrant worker and enormous inefficiencies for businesses.",3
We will be looking to put sensible limits on those powers in Committee to ensure Parliament has a say on our future immigration system Our second big concern is about social security co-ordination.,3
At least we have an immigration White Paper that indicates the Government’s thinking.,3
"The Government must simplify the immigration rules, follow the Law Commission’s recommendations, bring back legal aid and restore data protection We find the Bill a missed opportunity to address the moral and humanitarian failures of this Tory Government towards refugees and asylum seekers, as set out emotively by the hon.",3
"There is nothing in the Bill, and very little in the White Paper, on refugees and asylum seekers.",3
"At a minimum, we must bring an end to indefinite detention and fix refugee family reunion.",2
"Members for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis) and for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell) for their cross-party work to end indefinite detention In conclusion, on immigration and social security, the Government have not done their homework.",3
We are not willing to grant the Government such broad powers to introduce as yet unknown rules on immigration and social security.,3
Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington raised the specific issue of Irish citizenship and deportation.,3
"Of course, the UK has always had the power to deport or exclude Irish citizens, but in the light of the historical, community and political ties between the UK and Ireland, along with the existence of the common travel area, the approach since 2007 has been to consider Irish citizens for deportation only where a court has recommended deportation in sentencing or where the Secretary of State has concluded that owing to the exceptional circumstances of a case the public interest requires deportation.",3
"Our current visa arrangements are designed for elite sports people and coaches who are internationally established at the highest level, and whose employment will make a significant contribution to the development of sport.",3
"Gentleman will be aware that 95% of those who are here without immigration leave are in the community, and I am sure that he will welcome the current Yarl’s Wood community pilot scheme.",3
"It is right that we work to make the correct decisions, but detention remains part of our immigration policy.",3
"It is important for us to work on the immigration bail pilots and, of course, on detention in the community My right hon.",3
"Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Sir John Hayes) spoke about the conventional view that we should have one immigration policy for the whole United Kingdom, and I absolutely agreed with what he said.",3
"Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry) made a point very early in the debate about fairness and language, and about the importance of not conflating asylum with immigration routes.",3
I sometimes find it hugely frustrating when people conflate the terms “asylum seeker” and “refugee” and “economic migrant”.,3
Friend’s intervention with an important observation about language and tone I am well aware that there are strong and passionate views about immigration on both sides of the House.,3
"Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) said that we were making immigration policy with the slash of a pen, but he was far from correct.",3
"Gentleman also spoke about asylum seekers having the right to work, and went so far as to suggest that my right hon.",3
"In the same way, through our engagement process we will continue to listen to businesses large and small, sectors like the universities, the National Farmers Union, the Royal College of Nursing and the CBI, which we have been doing to date, because of course the conversation on immigration has not simply started over the course of the last few weeks, but has been going for well over a year The hon.",3
"To add a little bit of levity, however, he would like to hold up Switzerland as an example of how individual cantons can run their own immigration policies, and indeed they can, but I gently draw his attention to the case of Nancy Holten, a vegan anti-cowbell campaigner who twice had her application for a Swiss passport refused by a referendum—we all know how keen we are on those in this place—and I am far from convinced that that is an effective immigration policy I am running out of time, but I would like to mention the contribution of my hon.",3
She raised the issue of Henry VIII powers and the immigration rules.,3
"Of course, historically since the Immigration Act 1971 the immigration rules have been used to firm up immigration policy by Governments of all parties, and we will undoubtedly continue to do so, but if anybody thinks these do not get scrutinised, I would point them to the hon.",3
"Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald), who always gives me a very hard time whenever immigration rules make it to a debate in Delegated Legislation Committee I fear that I have reached the end of my comments.",3
I welcome the remarks about Rabbie Burns—a little bit of Scottish poetry always goes down well—and I reinforce the message that this has to be an immigration policy for the whole United Kingdom.,3
We want an immigration system that works for the whole UK and we will be continuing the engagement.,3
I would like to update the House on the investigation into the tragic deaths of the 39 migrants discovered last Wednesday in Essex.,3
We have been confronted with a stark reminder of the evils of people smuggling and human trafficking.,2
"As I heard today and last week from Essex police, it will involve working with partners overseas and foreign law enforcement agencies and unravelling a threat of criminality that could stretch halfway across the world.",3
"This morning, he appeared at Chelmsford magistrates court via video link, charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.",3
"The Home Office will now accelerate our joint intelligence-led operation between the police, the National Crime Agency and immigration enforcement, which aims to disrupt and deter organised crime gangs using refrigerated and hard-sided lorries to smuggle clandestine migrants I would like to stress once again that the nationalities of the victims have not been confirmed at this stage, but work is under way to co-ordinate the international response to this incident.",3
"I can confirm to the House that, as of today, I have received agreement from the Belgian authorities to deploy extra UK immigration enforcement officers to Zeebrugge.",3
"I have also been in contact with other international partners to offer assistance to any foreign nationals who may have been affected by this tragedy Last week’s tragedy was the culmination of a broad, more general rise in global migration, but also of organised criminality.",3
The motivations that lead people to try to cross borders illegally are broad and complex.,2
"All areas of Government have a role to play—whether it is in strengthening our borders and eliminating the pull factors in this country, or in addressing many of the root causes to suppress demand for illegal migration.",2
"We already have an illegal migration strategy in place, but as the tragic events last week in Essex have shown, there is much more to do.",3
I am one of the most liberal and pro-immigration politicians in the House.,3
"I welcome her, just as I welcome the Syrian refugees who have experienced racism in my own constituency.",3
"The Migration Advisory Committee report is very clear that immigrants are net contributors to our economy—they make a beneficial contribution to our country—but it also recognises that, where there have been high concentrations of immigration, public money has not followed.",3
"We have to invest in the infrastructure so that the burden of immigration—in terms of numbers and public services—is borne by the Government, not individual constituents trying to integrate and contribute In my constituency, we have formal advice from Clackmannanshire Council, which is SNP-run, saying that the SNP-run NHS—I have the letter here and I am happy to put it in the Library—has to be mindful of accepting refugees to the area because of the lack of GPs in Clackmannanshire.",3
This shows that the SNP has not managed public services such that we can welcome people to our country The immigration proposals and the opportunity through Brexit to shape our immigration policies are very important.,3
We do not need to get lost in a vicious circle of negative stories about immigration.,2
"We have a fine opportunity to develop new visa schemes and forms of co-operation with other countries, as my right hon.",3
"When we are discussing immigration, we are not talking about faceless numbers; we are talking about real people who come here, contribute and make our country better.",2
We have a chance to develop a more innovative and welcoming immigration system in this country.,3
"For those who get positive outcomes, they will—likely with the growing support of increasingly advanced and integrated technology—get their positive outcomes more quickly.",3
"Given the impact that an incorrect immigration decision can have on the lives of individuals and families, this effect ought not to be underestimated” It is fundamental to, and a crucial part of, the Bill that there is no cut-off date.",3
"Under the settled status scheme, an EU national who does not apply during the operational period will become illegally resident.",3
"People will be denied access to services and will be at risk of deportation Obviously, looked-after children and young care leavers fall into that category, and the right reverend Prelate drew our attention to that.",3
"Joao’s mother (who holds a passport from Guinea-Bissau) fled his father, who was violent, in 2014.",3
"Joao is unable to get a Portuguese passport without the active participation of both his parents in his nationality registration application” I could give a number of other examples, but in view of the time, I will not do so I will, however, refer to some of the recommendations made by Coram.",3
"We were told that there would be no visa arrangements between the EU and us—but, again, we have agreed reciprocally that there will be 90 days of visa-free travel with all members of the European Union So there will be a series of mini-deals.",3
"Secondly, they are not checked at the border but by computer in Salford.",3
"Almost all checks relate to suspected smuggling of tobacco, other excisable goods, drugs, arms or illegal immigrants.",3
It has a smart border and two inspection posts away from the border to ensure that there is no congestion when checking animals and animal products.,3
"My Lords, we are now in the endgame of Brexit: less than four weeks to go, a choice between crashing out, staying in or some sort of ingenious or fantastical deal over the Irish border The Lords, we all accept, is a revising Chamber.",3
"Can he therefore tell us what proportion of UK exports is currently composed of cauliflowers, what scale of expansion in domestic cauliflower production is envisaged, and how easy it will be to supply cauliflowers to California while they are still fresh?",3
"The immigration, Fisheries and Agriculture Bills are still waiting for Commons Report stage.",3
"As Jacob Rees-Mogg admitted in the Commons last week, fear of amendment has led to government delay This means that—although the Minister may try to assure us that the necessary legislative framework will be in place for the UK to leave on 31 October—that can happen only if the Government are given Henry VIII powers to put through a very large number of statutory instruments to allow them to push a massive legislative programme through in two weeks; otherwise, we will not be ready and will need to extend This week, the Mail on Sunday headlined allegations from “a senior Number 10 source”—in other words, close to the Prime Minister—that: “The Government is working on extensive investigations into Dominic Grieve, Oliver Letwin and Hilary Benn and their involvement with foreign powers and the funding of their activities.",3
"… The drafting of … legislation in collusion with foreign powers must be fully investigated” Later in the article, Philip Hammond’s name was added to this list of potential traitors.",3
"Number 10 thinks that three recent Conservative Cabinet Ministers have now gone over to the enemy The hostile foreign power with which the Prime Minister’s Office alleged that they were colluding was not Russia or China but France, an ally of the UK for more than 100 years.",3
"But then he discovered that appealing to nationalist resentments, attacking the European Union, sneering at intellectuals and demonising immigrants whipped up public emotions and consolidated his hold on power On the Conservative Benches behind the Prime Minister last Wednesday, Brexiter MPs were attacking the “liberal establishment” as the core of the alleged parliamentary plot to thwart the will of the people.",3
"The first was in 1687-88, when Tories supported the King against Parliament and patriots such as General John Churchill appealed to a foreign power—the Dutch—to invade Britain in what we now remember as the Glorious Revolution.",3
"You are quite right, Mr Speaker Every single one of these cases is a shocking indictment of this Government’s pandering to far right racism, sham immigration targets and the dog whistle of the right-wing press The Home Secretary has spoken about being a second generation migrant himself.",3
"I say to you, Home Secretary, before the review is even complete, why, why are you deporting people?",3
We have heard about deportation flights to Jamaica this week.,3
"Why are you deporting them, given that this review has not reported and there has been no compensation How can you be confident that you are not making the same mistakes?",3
Another has a British passport.,4
Friend the Prime Minister has finished painting models of them Our new economic plan will not stop at the borders of England; it will be a plan for all the nations of the United Kingdom.,3
"We support diplomacy, with £90 million of funding for 1,000 new diplomats and overseas staff, and 14 new and upgraded diplomatic posts.",3
We make available today an additional £10 million to continue the integration areas programme that I first announced in 2018 as Communities Secretary.,3
"Once we have left the EU, we will be able to create a points-based immigration system that meets the needs of the UK economy and the British people.",3
We have already dropped arbitrary immigration targets.,3
"We have recently announced a new, highly flexible fast-track visa for scientists.",3
"But it will be somewhere, unless we somehow integrate.",3
"We should be told, if we are not having a hard border, what are we going to have?",3
"To give a couple of examples, there is a continuing obsession with immigration, and an inability to separate asylum seekers—enormous numbers, coming in the shape of 20 people in one boat—from the hundreds of thousands who come from other parts of the EU to work here, very hard and very well, most of them sending money home to help wherever they come from.",3
"In shorthand, it is that economic development in the east and south has created challenges to our western economies, driving deindustrialisation, inequality and immigration.",3
"“Stop the world, I want to get off,” is not a political prospectus or a realistic view of how to run a global, integrated economy The nostalgia and nativism that are so evident on the Government Benches may be enough to feed the beast of the European Research Group, but they will not feed our children.",3
"Blaming foreigners and immigrants—the other—while hawking sepia-coloured myths of betrayal and loss has been a tried and tested strategy of populists and worse the world over since time immemorial, but we surely know that it is neither right nor real.",3
"Mr Speaker, I thank you for granting this urgent question and the Minister for her response In December 2018, the Home Secretary declared a major incident and said that countering this illegal migration would be an operational priority for the Home Office.",3
That was in response to 40 illegal migrants who were picked up on Christmas day crossing the short straits.,3
"At the end of May, 74 people—a record number—were intercepted on one day in a record number of boats.",3
"Some 140 migrants were picked up in the month of May, the highest number since December.",3
"In a Westminster Hall debate that I held on 30 January, the Minister responded that “we have an absolute duty to protect the border and stop organised crime gangs exploiting vulnerable individuals who want to come here by sending them through the busiest shipping lane in the world.",3
"That is why we must stop this incredibly dangerous route becoming the new normal for those wanting to enter the UK illegally.”—[Official Report, 30 January 2019; Vol.",3
"We must be able to defend our coastline from this illegal immigration We are spending some €50 million—we are giving that amount to the French Government—to try to stamp out this migration flow, but it is not working.",3
"In 2018, 543 illegal migrants attempted to cross to this country from France.",3
"of them are Iranian, and apart from Germany, we are the biggest recipient of asylum claims from Iran of any EU country.",4
"If they know that they cannot come here and that they will be taken back to French ports, it will put an end to the horrible trade of human trafficking, which is driving this illegal activity The Government have, I am afraid, introduced largely cosmetic measures to show that we are trying to tackle this problem.",3
"Not one asylum seeker was intercepted by the Royal Navy, despite the best efforts of all the sailors.",3
"I have huge praise for all the men and women in the Border Force, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the coastguard and the Royal Navy, who have been doing their best, but the way to solve the problem is for the Government to take a strategic decision that once these people are intercepted at sea they are returned to France.",3
"Indeed, 35,000 people claim asylum each year and we have returned only 1,186 since 2015.",3
"In November, we learned that at least 164 Windrush citizens were wrongly removed, detained or stopped at the border by our own Government.",3
Eleven of those who were wrongly deported have died.,3
"Every single one of those cases is a shocking indictment of your Government’s pandering to far right racism, sham immigration targets and the dog whistle of the right-wing press”.—[Official Report, Commons, 5/2/18; cols.",3
Nothing proves that better than the results of appeals against Home Office immigration decisions and how those appeals have increased in number over the years.,3
"First, every interview should be audio recorded so that there is no uncertainty over responses or the ability of those interviewed to understand a language foreign to them.",3
"So, the fight goes on” It could well be that immigration matters should no longer be a Home Office responsibility but in a department of their own.",3
"We want no indefinite detention, the right to work much sooner than after the present 12 months and far better legal advice and protection for young refugees when they reach 18 years of age.",3
But how can we criticise such moves when we ourselves have a questionable record on immigration?,3
"In the 17th century, the Dutch of Amsterdam welcomed immigrants and said: “We are seekers after truth and are richer in having you among us” Are we also not richer because of others who have contributed and are contributing to our lives?",3
Remember: we were all immigrants once.,3
"My Lords, there is very little trust in our immigration system.",2
"On the one hand, the Home Office is a byword for inefficiency, maladministration and heartlessness, with its “go home” vans, the Windrush scandal and the hostile environment; on the other hand, many people mistrust immigration because they are not sure that people are here legally.",3
"Since the Border Force was slashed under the Conservatives, that distrust of good management has some validity The migration and asylum system is not fit for purpose and needs to work a great deal better than it currently does to increase efficiency, quality, value for money and trust, making Britain welcoming and customer-friendly for those we want to stay, and better at stopping and removing those we do not.",3
"This needs radical reform and better deployment of resources to convince the public that migration is well managed, and to convince migrants that the UK is not out to cause them misery The Home Office sets itself up to fail with the net migration target that the Prime Minister is so wedded to.",3
"I am afraid that the sight of the Home Secretary flying back from his holiday over Christmas and declaring a major incident over a few hundred migrants in the Channel—it needed to be dealt with competently, but it was not a major incident—did not increase trust.",3
"Fear of EU free movers could have been turned into a win-win if the Government had been more nimble on the local impact, channelling local resources so that communities could see that they attracted more doctors, teaching assistants and so on, to help everybody Far from offering improvements, the new immigration Bill will suck all EU citizens into the bureaucratic system that they have so far escaped, instead of the simplicity of EU free movement—and of course Britons will lose that opportunity for free movement as well, because it is a two-way street.",3
The NHS will be paying hundreds of millions of pounds in visa fees to the Home Office—talk about robbing Peter to pay Paul.,3
"Even if 5% are rejected, that is 175,000 people, and that will not improve either the Home Office’s reputation or social integration.",3
"Do the EEA regulations remain in force, even if the immigration Bill is passed?",3
"Subsequently, I was the Conservative spokesman on this subject for much of my 17 years in the European Parliament Your Lordships will note that I mention race relations in the same breath as immigration.",3
"In order to maintain good race and community relations, you need to have an immigration policy that is shown to be firm but also fair and compassionate.",3
"I want to examine quickly the components, which should be looked at in separate ways First, there is immigration proper, which requires clear rules and procedures that must be followed by applicants and by the authorities.",3
"Although I appreciate that time has passed since, my experience always was that officers and officials working in the department and in the area of immigration carried out their duties with great devotion and sensitivity.",3
"Ministers should always take responsibility and not try to pass it on to officials I want to talk about asylum for a moment, because the grant of refugee status is something on which we have a good record in this country.",3
"Since our EU referendum, the net increase in EU citizens in the UK has dropped considerably and is currently falling fast, while the number of non-EU immigration applications has continued to grow.",3
It will provide new challenges to good race relations and perhaps not satisfy some of those who appear to have been misled or have the wrong approach to the issue of immigration and international relations I mention one further element of any sensible and practical immigration policy.,3
"I know that this is controversial, but where our immigration rules are abused or illegality is found, including with people trafficking, in which we have seen growth recently, we must in the interests of fairness to those who comply react by refusing in many cases to grant the right to remain here and, in appropriate cases, return the persons concerned to the places from which they came.",3
"In asylum cases, the same applies, and we must return the failed applicants either to their source country or at least to the first safe country they were in after leaving their country.",3
"The Government’s removal policy is often the least implemented because it is controversial, sensitive and often expensive, and the loss of the Dublin agreements between EU countries as to safe country returns will make things more difficult for us Finally, it is important to emphasise that, despite statements to the contrary, UK immigration policy has always been ultimately under the control of the UK.",3
"We have heard about the importance of immigration to our economy, growth and public services, the bureaucracy and narrowness of the immigration White Paper and the problems in achieving settled status for EU citizens living in the UK.",3
"The first relates to refugees from persecution, and concerns the time taken to consider genuine applications for political asylum from those fleeing persecution and waiting in a third country for permission to come to the UK as their preferred destination under the UN refugee agency scheme.",3
"I recently referred to the Home Office a specific case concerning asylum seekers from Iran, because it seems to take a very long time for such cases to reach a conclusion.",3
"The Minister who replied, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, agreed to investigate whether the Home Office draws a clear distinction between those genuinely seeking refuge from persecution and economic migrants.",3
"This distinction matters, and I hope the Minister might agree to look at the procedures followed and assess how applications from those genuinely fleeing persecution might be speeded up The second issue relates to what happens to refugees in the UK granted leave to stay.",3
"The problem is that refugees do not have prior notice of when a decision will be made on their asylum application, and they get only 28 days to leave their accommodation.",3
"Under Homelessness Reduction Act regulations, some public bodies in England are required to refer people at risk of homelessness to local housing authorities—yet asylum accommodation providers are not included, on the understanding that contractual obligations are sufficient.",3
"If the Minister would be willing to meet with me to talk about it further, I would be very happy to do so The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has piloted the appointment of 35 local authority asylum support liaison officers in 19 areas of England.",3
Their remit includes supporting refugees into housing—a most welcome step.,3
"Understandably, newly recognised refugees without savings struggle to pay deposits on private tenancies.",3
"The Government’s integration loans scheme is one way to overcome such a hurdle, but I wonder whether the Minister might be willing to look at ways in which this could be made a more viable option for those unable to access social housing Finally, I raise other issues relating to universal credit.",3
"As we have heard, he is a keen and passionate advocate for a fair and effective immigration system.",3
"As my mother was a refugee in this country, I was brought up to appreciate fully the importance of the issues that many noble Lords have raised today People from all over the world come to the UK and help to make this country what it is today.",4
"As the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, and others have said, that is exactly why we need a fair immigration system that treats people with decency and respect and is trusted by all.",3
"Although I disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Bull, about the breadth of the debate—it may be an opportunity for speakers—I fear I may be writing to many noble Lords about their valid questions I remind the House of the scale of the immigration system to give some perspective.",3
"Clearly, I cannot comment on the role of Ministers The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, was critical of the Government in relation to our work with refugees, particularly child refugees, and I feel I need to set the balance straight.",3
"Our resettlement schemes offer a safe and legal route to the UK for the most vulnerable refugees The noble Lord, Lord Shipley, mentioned the speed of decision-making and better communication, and he was right to do so.",3
"In the year ending September 2018, almost 6,000 people were provided with protection and support, meaning that we have now completed more than two-thirds of our commitment to resettle 20,000 refugees from Syria by 2020 through the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme, and we are confident that we will deliver the full commitment.",3
"As of September 2018, 1,075 people have been resettled through the vulnerable children’s resettlement scheme, although, as the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said, we have more to do in that area, and we are determined to do so A number of noble Lords asked about the quality of decision-making in the asylum system.",3
"Crucially, we have changed the law to stop children being routinely detained in the immigration system.",3
"Noble Lords will remember that in 2009 more than 1,100 children entered detention; last year, 44 were held for a very brief period I am keen to take some time to respond to the comments about the proposed future immigration system; I shall briefly set out our vision for how it will work.",3
"We aim to maximise the benefits of the UK leaving the EU and create a joined-up, coherent border, immigration and citizenship system.",3
"As the Government set out in the White Paper published on 19 December, the future immigration system will work in the best interests of the UK.",3
"In line with the Migration Advisory Committee’s recommendation, we will focus on the high skills that the noble Lord, Lord Mountevans, and others mentioned and prioritise those migrants who bring most benefit to the UK, maximising the benefits of immigration Importantly, we are launching a year-long engagement process to make sure that businesses and all key stakeholders can help shape the final details of policy and processes.",3
The immigration White Paper sets out the Government’s intention to attract the best creative and cultural talent from around the world.,3
They can receive payment for appearances at certain festivals for up to a month or for a specific engagement without the need for formal sponsorship or a work visa.,3
"They will be aware that we have asked the Law Commission to look at that, and we will consider its findings carefully In conclusion, the Government remain committed to improving the border, immigration and citizenship system.",3
"We absolutely recognise that there is more to do and that is why we are listening to and engaging with Members across both Houses, with those using the system and with stakeholders, and we are taking independent advice as we seek to build a new immigration system for the future that meets our economic, humanitarian and security needs as a country.",3
"Noble Lords have raised important issues in many areas, particularly in relation to the asylum system and the challenges that we face as we leave the EU.",3
"I share some of those anxieties, but I want to probe a little deeper to explain why I think these consequences might come about If you defend Brexit on the grounds that we need to get out of the European Union to control our borders and thus the kind and number of people coming into this country, obviously you are saying that immigration control is the central motive for it.",2
They are the people who said that the point of Brexit is to control immigration.,3
"As long as Brexit is defended in such language, it is inevitable that it will involve controlling immigration, often wrongly.",3
"There will be constant pressure on controlling immigration and our lives will be that much the poorer for it Therefore, if I was a Brexiteer, which I am not, I would want to make the case for Brexit on different grounds—the opposite grounds; namely, that the point of Brexit is to make Britain open to the world so that we can walk into the world and the world can walk into Britain.",3
I shall move on here to argue that immigration in one form is central to culture.,3
"When we consider any of the academic disciplines with which I have been involved, such as philosophy or science, they have benefited from the presence of a sizeable number of immigrants.",3
"If immigration is central to culture, one cannot blindly say that all forms of immigration must be restricted This leads to another question: if you accept my argument that immigration is central to culture, what kind of restriction can you put on immigration?",3
One needs to bear in mind the specificity of culture: it is the kind of area in which restrictions on immigration must take a particular form Let us take two issues that have come up time and again.,3
"Multi-country, multi-entry visas will need to be easily available for these people Secondly, if you were to insist that anybody who comes in must have a certain amount of income—£23,000, £30,000 or whatever—you are again imposing a criterion that will not be met by the artist, because artists’ wages are lower than the national median.",3
"If, therefore, we have occasion to restrict immigration in the cultural sphere, these are the criteria by which we can do that The third important criterion has to do with the kind of skills this country requires.",3
"Many people have rightly expressed the anxiety that in the desire to stop immigration or to stop people coming here, we will starve ourselves of the kind of skills we badly need—for example, heritage skills.",2
This country has one of the toughest pet border regimes in the world.,2
Every pet dog travelling to Great Britain on approved routes has its microchip and passport checked to confirm it is properly vaccinated and is old enough to travel.,4
We clearly now have an opportunity to look at how we can further strengthen our controls to crack down on animal traffickers and put a stop to an abhorrent and illegal trade.,3
"We need to work to deter illegal puppy traders by buying puppies only from reputable breeders, seeing the young animal with its mother and checking its health history Defra wishes to tackle this matter comprehensively.",3
"We regularly review our activities at the border to ensure our enforcement work aligns with the threat posed by what is, I am afraid, an evolving trade.",3
Those involved in this trafficking are often involved in other criminal activity.,3
"We are increasing resources for detecting smuggled puppies, and have done so by one-third at major UK ports since 2017.",3
"I beg to move, That this House regrets that the outgoing Prime Minister’s legacy will be her hostile environment policy and her unrealistic and damaging net migration target; calls for a fundamental change in the Government’s approach to immigration, refugee and asylum policy to one based on evidence, respect for human rights and fairness; welcomes the contribution made by migrants to the UK’s economy, society and culture; rejects regressive Government proposals to extinguish European free movement rights and to require EU nationals in the UK to apply for settled and pre-settled status; and recognises that a migration policy that works for the whole of the UK will require different policy solutions for different parts of the UK, particularly given Scotland’s demographic and economic profile I am very grateful for the opportunity to introduce this debate on what is such a crucial subject—the urgent need for Parliament to draw a line under a dismal decade of dreadful and sometimes disgraceful migration and asylum policies.",3
"Rather than tackling burning injustices right across the field of immigration and asylum policy, her policies created them.",3
"Universities were put at a competitive disadvantage not just by more restrictive immigration rules, particularly regarding post-study work, but by the message that was sent right around the globe.",3
"The net migration target and its relentless failure problematised and politicised immigration numbers and has substantially contributed to the political mess that this country is in today Last week, the Home Secretary described the net migration target as “crude” and said that it should be ditched, and he is 100% right.",3
"Every quarter, a new set of immigration statistics would be published showing the target missed by a country mile—yet again.",3
"Alongside endlessly restricted visa rules, the hostile environment was a truly wicked means by which a net migration target would be achieved.",3
"These measures have “a disproportionately discriminatory effect, and I would assume and hope that those legislators who voted in favour of the scheme would be aghast to learn of its discriminatory effect” Those are not my words, but the words of Mr Justice Martin Spencer in the High Court, who in ruling the whole scheme unlawful went on to say: “Even if the Scheme had been shown to be efficacious in playing its part in the control of immigration, I would have found that this was significantly outweighed by the discriminatory effect…In these circumstances, I find that the Government has not justified this measure, nor, indeed, come close to doing so.” That is a hostile environment in a nutshell: no evidence that it achieves anything positive, hugely discriminatory, totally unjustified and illegal.",3
Warnings from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and many others went unheeded.,3
"Its victims are a huge and varied group: the 9 million British citizens without a passport who struggle because 43% of landlords and landladies say they are less likely to rent to such citizens, now that the hostile environment has made them petrified of getting right-to-rent checks wrong; the thousands of children who are unable to afford the citizenship they are entitled to or the leave to remain that they qualify for; the children who do have leave to remain but who are brought up in families with no recourse to public funds; the hundreds—perhaps thousands—of Eritreans who were wrongly refused asylum on the basis of the Home Office’s dodgy country guidance, many of whom are now street-homeless and destitute; and the several thousands of students wrongly caught up in the Test of English for International Communication teaching scandal who were wrongly presumed guilty after the company that messed up the testing in the first place was then allowed to clean up its own mess.",3
There is a host of opportunities to improve the asylum system.,3
"Only last week, we debated refugee family reunion rules.",3
"We have already passed on Second Reading a Bill to change those rules, yet it has been held up in the system, thanks to the Government I have briefly mentioned four issues, but there are a million others that other Members of Parliament will touch on, such as visas for religious workers, visit visas, lack of appeal rights, lack of legal aid, the complexities of the tier 2 system, visas for fishing vessels, visas for agricultural workers—and so on and so forth.",3
The truth is that our immigration and asylum systems are truly in a mess That brings me on to the Government’s proposals for our future immigration system—their White Paper.,3
The bit of the immigration system that is a disaster is the bit that is being left largely unreformed.,2
The one bit of the immigration system that works perfectly well—free movement of people—is being annihilated.,2
Simply repeating ad nauseam that we are “taking back control of our borders” is not an argument and it is not leadership.,3
There are so many other features of the proposed new immigration system that are causing huge concern.,3
"Gentleman raised his point then, but he knows as well as I do that his question is best addressed to the Cabinet Office, which is responsible for elections, not me as the Immigration Minister Alongside the White Paper on the future borders and immigration system that we published last year, the borders, immigration and citizenship system continues to deliver, to secure the UK border, control immigration and provide world-class services that contribute to our prosperity The hon.",3
"Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald) talked with regret about the immigration system, but it is worth reminding the House of some salient points about its successes.",3
"In the year to March, more people came to the UK, with 142.8 million passengers arriving here; the number of visitor visas granted was at a record high of 2.3 million, an increase of 9%; 181,000 people were given entry clearance to come to work in the UK and bolster the UK’s economy; 358,000 students came to the UK to study; over 5,700 people were provided with protection and support through our four UK resettlement schemes; over 5,600 family reunion visas were issued, over 2,700 of which were for children; and 89,000 people were granted settlement, with 149,000 granted British citizenship The majority of the people I have referred to engage with the immigration system in a smooth way.",3
"The number of visa applications to study at the UK’s universities increased by 10% last year, to the highest number ever recorded, and visa application numbers are 27% higher than they were in 2011.",3
"The House will be aware that last year the Migration Advisory Committee—the Government’s expert, non-partisan advisers on immigration matters—carried out a detailed study into international students.",3
"If the Government had done this, we could have avoided the situation where, four months before we face a cliff edge, millions of EU citizens are still in limbo The SNP supported our amendment to the immigration Bill, which would make settled status a declaratory system, so EU citizens living in the UK would be automatically granted settled status, rather than having to apply for it.",3
"I believe that that argument shows the Government have learned the wrong lessons from Windrush The Government are saying that Windrush people were illegally detained and deported, because they did not have the proper papers to prove they were in the UK legally.",3
"With EU citizens, the Government have decided to create a situation where people will still be detained and deported, but that will be legal because they have not applied for settled status in time.",3
"Just as the Government are not fulfilling their obligations to EU citizens, they are not fulfilling their humanitarian obligations to refugees The Prime Minister has consistently failed the most vulnerable child refugees.",3
"Despite repeated calls from non-governmental organisations and MPs and a vote on the Floor of the House, the Government have failed to expand refugee family reunion.",3
"They do not require legislation to be enacted, and they would make an immeasurable difference to the lives of refugees in the UK.",3
"As we move beyond the failures of the past, we must start building an idea of what new immigration policy will meet the needs of our economy and build prosperity In December, the Government published a White Paper on immigration.",3
"In Scotland, less than 10% of those in caring personal service occupations earn above £25,000, and none earns £30,000 Labour and the SNP agree on our diagnosis of a broken immigration system.",3
"The SNP has argued for a devolved immigration system, where Scotland is given the power to determine its own immigration rules.",3
"We believe this approach would be unenforceable, because there would be no way to distinguish between those who have a visa under the Scottish system and those who have a visa for the rest of the UK.",3
We would either need visa checks along Hadrian’s Wall or we would have to rely on the hostile environment.,3
"Under a Labour Government, a devolved immigration system would be unnecessary.",3
"Our immigration system will be flexible and based on the needs of our economy, including Scotland’s, not on bogus migration targets In conclusion, the Prime Minister’s legacy will be a cruel and hostile immigration policy, which has harmed our economy and caused the Windrush crisis.",3
"Whoever is our next Prime Minister, they must commit to ending the hostile environment and introduce a 28-day time limit on immigration detention.",3
"Leaving the European Union provides us with a unique opportunity to reshape and maximise the benefits of immigration to the UK, through a sensible, fairer system that nurtures talent at home while attracting the best talent from around the world for the benefit of the UK economy.",3
"Although I wholeheartedly welcome the skills-based approach to immigration in the White Paper, it failed to recognise the differing immigration needs of sectors in different parts of the country.",3
"We should not lose sight of that, or make the same mistakes in the United Kingdom As a Scottish Conservative, let me say that I am unashamedly pro-immigration.",3
I also discard the notion that migrants are somehow solely responsible for pressures on our public services and the housing market.,3
"Blaming problems in our personal lives and in the nation’s life on migrants is lazy and wrong Turning to the White Paper, it is vital to regional and sectoral economies across the United Kingdom that our approach to immigration be flexible, based on evidence, and not one-size-fits-all.",3
"I think that the failure to recognise that was one of the reasons why the White Paper was met with such hostility and negativity from various groups and business and industry leaders across Scotland As has already been discussed, under the current proposals, to be granted a work visa a migrant must secure a job paying at least £30,000 a year.",3
"They are industries that depend heavily on migrant workers, and they do not pay anywhere near £30,000.",2
"Personally, I should prefer a uniform threshold at a lower level: a threshold of about £18,000 might be sensible Similar logic applies to student visas.",3
"Under the current proposals, the UK will offer leave to remain under student visas to last for three years.",3
I do not want to see a student visa system that incentivises overseas students to pick universities elsewhere in the UK while Scotland potentially misses out on those benefits simply because it structures its degrees slightly differently.,3
"We need an immigration system that nurtures the best talent to remain in the UK, deploying the skills gained here, rather than encouraging a brain-drain to the detriment of our economy, whether in Scotland or in the rest of the UK.",2
"I therefore think that post-study work visa schemes should be a priority We on the Scottish Affairs Committee have done a great deal of cross-party work in this regard, considering in particular the issues of changing demographics in Scotland and depopulation issues.",3
"Unsurprisingly, I reject the notion that the answer lies in devolved immigration policy, especially when, as far as I am aware—I am sure that an SNP Member will correct me if I am wrong—it is still the SNP’s position that the devolved immigration policy should be implemented and enforced by the Home Office through border control, presumably so that the SNP can blame UK Government agencies for any problems, as it does in every other context My hon.",3
Friend the Member for Stirling (Stephen Kerr) mentioned some of the agencies that do not support the devolution of immigration policy.,3
A number of organisations have stated clearly that Scotland’s needs could and should be best met through a UK-wide system We need the future immigration system to be nimble and flexible enough to adapt to the changing requirements of our economy.,3
"No arbitrary targets, please: the right level of immigration for the UK is whatever number is needed at that particular point in time, in the areas where we need it We need a flexible immigration system that works for every part of the UK.",3
"Farming, fish processing, hospitality and social care all rely heavily on foreign labour, and will continue to do so.",3
"Business leaders have rightly voiced concerns about the immigration White Paper, and those concerns should be taken on board and reacted to.",3
I find it ironic because she herself was the author of part of the infrastructure of the institutionalised racism that underpins UK immigration policy I know that that is not a recent development.,3
"As has already been said, the Prime Minister’s previous incarnation as Home Secretary was the time when that hostile environment was ramped up and the gimlet eye of suspicion fell on everyone: an immigrant, someone who might consider giving a job to an immigrant, a landlord who might consider offering a home to an immigrant family, a truck driver just crossing the channel, a charity offering support to asylum seekers, and anyone who might have come into contact with an immigrant or might consider coming into contact with such a person I thought that Gordon Brown’s “British jobs for British workers” was bad, but the then Home Secretary obviously thought that she could go one better.",3
Labour’s anti-immigration mugs were topped by the Tories “go home” vans.,3
"From the wife of a bodyguard to the Queen to the owners of a business employing over a dozen people, from the young couples hoping to get married and build a life to the folk who came as children when their parents answered a call for workers—all these in my constituency and many others are being threatened with the big stick of deportation I have already mentioned in previous debates and discussions the negative effects that the refusal of visitors for performance is having on Edinburgh’s festivals.",3
"Examples include illustrators of children’s books being refused visas to speak at our book festival on the grounds that they might not go home to their families, homes and occupations afterwards; orchestras having to fight to bring their musicians; and actors who have travelled half the world being suspected of intending to settle in the UK.",3
"It suggests that our nation is not a welcoming nation and is not a place that is open for business And if the performers cannot get here, how many more visas are being refused to international travellers who would want to take in the festivals and explore a bit more of the country, spending money as they go?",3
"It also matters for important sectors such as finance and the gaming industry, not least because their customers and colleagues move constantly across international borders.",3
"We are talking about millions of pounds and thousands of jobs, but Alison Phipps, UNESCO chair in refugee integration, has said that she will stop hosting international conferences in the UK because of the Home Office’s “inept,” “embarrassing” and “discriminatory” visitor visa system which represents an effective travel ban for many academics An event in March, co-sponsored by the International Development Committee of this House, had most of its visas refused.",3
This damaging xenophobic attitude to immigration is not just a Brexit sideshow; it is a long-standing piece of arrogance and stupidity practised by successive UK Governments.,2
"This has been an excellent debate so far, and I am sure the Prime Minister will come to regret—at least I hope she will—that her defining legacy, quite apart from the Brexit chaos we face, is the hostile environment she created through her Government’s antagonistic, discriminatory and entirely counterproductive immigration policy In the Immigration Acts of 2014 and 2016, we have seen an effort to prevent people from accessing basic services such as employment, healthcare and education.",3
We have witnessed a Home Secretary become Prime Minister and knowingly take a cruel and entirely unnecessary approach towards immigration.,3
"If we listened to the Government, we would think the immigration process straightforward, but many people are unable simply to leave, as the Government might lead us to think.",3
"What will that five-year-old boy carry with him into the future The plight of Ms A is the plight of many refugees and asylum seekers throughout the country, and that has been further affected by the Government’s policy move to end automatic settlement for refugees after five years, deliberately leaving asylum seekers uncertain about whether they will eventually be deported.",3
"My constituency office in Renfrew deals with many cases like that of Ms A, and it is difficult to see how the climate of insecurity can be maintained if Scotland wants to continue to attract people from overseas in an attempt to combat the ageing of our population Recently, the UK Government also imposed changes for tier 5 entry visas, including, notably, the removal of ministers of religion from the eligibility criteria.",3
"If we take the example of Catholic communities, that change will have a significant impact on priests coming into the UK because most Catholic dioceses regularly use the tier 5 religious worker visa route for them to come here on supply placements while parish priests are away for short periods.",3
"The supply placements are imperative as they enable people to continue attending mass and receiving sacraments, while keeping parish activities running smoothly—activities that are of benefit to the entire community, not just to Catholics Under the new Home Office guidance, priests on supply placements will now be required to use the tier 2 minister of religion visa route, which will double the costs incurred by parishes and make supply cover effectively unaffordable in some of the poorer communities.",3
"Friend the Member for Glasgow East (David Linden) and touch on some of the representations that I have received from faith leaders across Renfrewshire, including from Bishop John Keenan I could go on about immigration detention policies, asylum seekers being denied the right to work, the denial of access to public funds and the ending of freedom of movement—which is one of the best intergovernmental policies ever drafted and something that my generation and the generation after have taken for granted because who in their right mind would want to end it?",3
"I could go on about Home Office incompetence, refugee family reunion rules, Windrush and sending LGBTQ people back to countries where homophobic persecution is rife The indifferent, iniquitous and incompetent Home Office’s roll of dishonour is, like immigration detention, limitless.",3
"If, instead of producing “Controls on immigration” mugs, Labour had joined the SNP and others in talking up the real and tangible benefits of immigration, the Brexit vote might not have come to pass Remarkably, the Labour Party has failed to stand up for freedom of movement, despite the enormous benefits it has brought to the UK.",3
"He wrote in The Guardian: “If freedom of movement means the freedom to exploit cheap labour in a race to the bottom, it will never be accepted in any future relationship with Europe.” That is completely wrong and risks scapegoating migrants for weak labour regulation.",3
"The Labour party failed to show proper opposition to the toxic rhetoric on immigration coming from UKIP and the Tories, out of fear of being seen as weak on immigration.",3
"The Labour party should ashamed of its infamous “Controls on immigration” mugs, to which my hon.",3
"The recent decrease in net migration has been driven by fewer people moving to Scotland from overseas and more people moving overseas, out of Scotland.",3
"I am not entirely surprised by that, given the immigration rhetoric over the past couple of years and the Brexit decision.",3
"Natural change—births minus deaths—did not contribute to population growth: over the same one-year period, there were 7,000 more deaths than births in Scotland We want the Scottish Parliament to have the powers to establish a less restrictive immigration policy.",3
"It is increasingly clear that the UK Government’s immigration policy does not address our economic, demographic or social needs.",3
There is cross-party support for the reintroduction of a proper post-study work visa that suits Scotland’s needs.,3
"I cannot quite manage it, but I really should be grateful, because by both their words and their actions, more people in Scotland now realise that the only way that Scotland will have policies in place to suit Scottish needs, whether on immigration or any other issue, is through independence.",3
"I am left with a puzzled question in my mind as to what Labour’s position on immigration is, but it is a bit similar to the puzzled question in my mind as to what Labour’s position on Brexit is.",3
"Those immigration policies, aided and abetted by the Labour party and Liberal Democrats, are not only a failure across the UK but a perfect example of this Parliament’s failure to address Scotland-specific solutions on reserved matters Our nationalism in the SNP is simply a desire to right that wrong by self-determination.",3
We do not blame foreigners or immigrants for the things that are wrong in our society.,2
All the evidence shows that the Scottish economy benefits from immigration.,3
"It is time for immigration policy to be made in Scotland, so that the Scottish Parliament can ensure that migration works to the benefit of the Scottish economy, to stimulate population growth and to enrich our society and our culture.",3
"Member for Glasgow North West (Carol Monaghan) might not have heard the announcement made earlier this week on the MAC’s commission with respect to salary thresholds, because she emphasised that point a great deal, but I reiterate to her that the visit visas are granted at a rate of about 88%, of which 97% are processed within 15 working days.",3
"That point has been put to me during the different stages of consideration of the immigration Bill, and I have no doubt that this is something that we really must resolve The hon.",3
Member for Glasgow Central (Alison Thewliss) spoke of immigration detention and described it as arbitrary.,3
"We are committed to improving the borders, immigration and citizenship system.",3
"Resolved, That this House regrets that the outgoing Prime Minister’s legacy will be her hostile environment policy and her unrealistic and damaging net migration target; calls for a fundamental change in the Government’s approach to immigration, refugee and asylum policy to one based on evidence, respect for human rights and fairness; welcomes the contribution made by migrants to the UK’s economy, society and culture; rejects regressive Government proposals to extinguish European free movement rights and to require EU nationals in the UK to apply for settled and pre-settled status; and recognises that a migration policy that works for the whole of the UK will require different policy solutions for different parts of the UK, particularly given Scotland’s demographic and economic profile.",3
"Communities such as Ebbw Vale, with very few immigrants, voted overwhelmingly for Brexit because of their fear of immigration.",3
"These were targeted at those who were most vulnerable to believing them, using the illegal hack of personal data from tens of millions of users The online harm to individuals, as other noble Lords have talked about, is profound, but there can be no greater harm to a nation state than the catastrophe of Brexit, brought about by referendum won by illegal campaigning—and we allow Nigel Farage to start another party to dupe the nation once more.",3
"Last year it came to light that our Home Office had deported potentially thousands of students, using a contractor analysing voice recordings with a machine.",3
"They asked the Educational Testing Service to analyse voice files to work out if students were using proxies to sit the English tests for them, and an immigration appeal tribunal in 2016 heard that when ETS’s voice analysis was checked with a human follow-up, the computer had been correct in only 80% of cases—meaning that some 7,000 students had their visas revoked in error Given what we know about algorithmic bias, and the growing use of algorithms for public service delivery, it is critical that public bodies are also subject to the measures set out in the White Paper.",3
"The charges are manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.",3
"The other investigations, under which three people have been released on bail, one of whom is being investigated by the Gardai, are not sub judice, nor are the wider policy issues of trafficking, port security et cetera.",3
"The Statement is as follows: “Mr Speaker, I would like to update the House on the investigation into the tragic deaths of the 39 migrants discovered last week in Essex.",3
They were the victims of brutal and unscrupulous criminal gangs and they paid the ultimate price We have been confronted with a stark reminder of the evils of people smuggling and human trafficking.,3
"It will, as I heard from Essex police last week and today, involve working with partners overseas and with foreign law enforcement agencies, to unravel a threat of criminality that could stretch half way across the world.",3
"This morning, he appeared at Chelmsford magistrates’ court via video link, charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.",3
"The Home Office will also accelerate its joint intelligence-led operation between the police, the National Crime Agency and immigration enforcement, which aims to disrupt and deter organised crime gangs that use refrigerated and hard-sided lorries to smuggle clandestine immigrants I stress once again that the nationalities of the victims have not been confirmed at this stage.",3
"I can confirm to the House that, as of today, I have received agreement from the Belgian authorities to deploy extra UK immigration enforcement officers to Zeebrugge.",3
"I have also been in contact with other international partners to offer assistance to any foreign nationals who may have been affected by this tragedy Last week’s tragedy was the culmination of a broad, more general rise in global migration, but also of organised criminality.",3
The motivations that lead people to try to cross borders illegally are also broad and complex.,2
"It is clear that we and all our partners must enhance our response All areas of government have a role to play, whether it is in strengthening our borders and eliminating the pull factors in this country, or in addressing the root causes to suppress demand for illegal immigration.",3
"We already have an illegal migration strategy in place, but as the tragic event in Essex last week has shown, there is much to do—much, much more to do I will be working across government this week to plan how we can strengthen and co-ordinate our response to the wider migration crisis that led these victims to try and enter the UK.",3
"That is a good argument for thinking again about the whole thing There is a way out: to have a customs union and for us to be in it; then, the Northern Ireland border would not be a problem and everything would be fairly straightforward.",3
"Nevertheless, immigration was pretty well the only issue that came up—I suspect that “take back control” was interpreted by people as meaning immigration.",3
I was talking to a woman who said she was not going to vote remain because of immigration.,3
"I was there for one day, and all the people who treated me—the doctor, nurses and so on—were immigrants.",3
"That was Project Fear, if there ever was I believe the referendum showed a strong alienation in this country between people in the north and those in the south, and between people in towns and the countryside and those in cities.",3
It is an alienation for which all political parties are responsible and which we have done very little to tackle.,2
"The debate will enable us to explore some of the key themes of the gracious Speech, including laying the foundations for a fair, modern and global immigration system by seizing the opportunities of Brexit, doing more to redress the balance in the criminal justice system, and ensuring that victims receive the support they need and the justice they deserve.",3
This Bill will be a step towards doing that The Government are determined to seize the opportunities of Brexit and bring an end to free movement to ensure that the UK can deliver a new points-based immigration system which will prioritise people’s skills and contributions to our society.,3
We will ensure that we can continue to have clear and effective legal rules in place for resolving cross-border disputes.,3
"If a UK business is contesting a contract with an overseas party, an international framework will be available for resolving it.",3
"The availability of agreed international rules will give UK businesses, citizens and families the confidence to work, live and trade across borders and will help the UK to flourish as a trading nation as we leave the European Union I know that the House will want to join me in paying tribute to the brave police officers up and down the country who do so much to keep us safe.",3
"This Bill is about making clear that, where a person is wanted for a serious crime in a country such as Canada or America and may be a danger to the public, we will get them off our streets faster and in front of a judge within 24 hours to allow extradition proceedings to commence We will also introduce measures to improve the justice system’s response to foreign nationals who abuse the system by committing crimes.",3
Anyone coming to our country seeking to do so should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them.,2
"The Government are already working hard to improve the efficient and effective removal of foreign-national offenders from the UK, but tougher action is needed to stop abuse of the system, speed up the process for deporting foreign-national offenders and deter foreign criminals from coming to the UK.",3
This Bill will significantly increase—from six months to five years—the maximum penalty for those who return to the UK in breach of a deportation order.,3
"We are committed to invest in every area of the UK to boost jobs, productivity and living standards and, once the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, we will have a unique opportunity to devolve and empower regions across the country The measures outlined in the gracious Speech set out a clear direction for the future of Britain: a country with safer streets where punishments fit crimes but criminals are supported to overcome the causes of their behaviour; one where victims are supported throughout the justice process and after, so that they can move on and rebuild their lives; a society that values marriage but accepts the modern realities of divorce and has no tolerance when it comes to domestic abuse; one that gives the most legal protection possible to brave police officers who risk life and limb to keep us safe; a nation that values immigration and has enough control of its borders to welcome the skills it really needs and reject foreign criminals from our shores; one that addresses serious violence at its root causes to keep our young people safe from harm; a United Kingdom where every constituent part and region has the necessary political will, the right infrastructure and the ability to make decisions in its own best interest; one where opportunity is levelled up and every single person can thrive.",3
The proposed immigration Bill will be the third such Bill before your Lordships’ House since I joined it.,3
"Indeed, talk of deportation has fuelled fears that many EU citizens could become embroiled in it if they fail to apply for settled status in time—Windrush revisited.",3
"There are a number of asylum and refugee issues that also need to be addressed, in particular the right to work, family reunion and the destitution faced by too many who fall through the bureaucratic cracks when granted refugee status because they are not allowed enough time to move from asylum support to mainstream social security.",3
"Further, although these are not strictly speaking immigration issues, the Bill would provide an opportunity to put right a couple of injustices raised recently by the Joint Committee on Human Rights.",3
One is the denial of citizenship to the offspring of fathers from British Overseas Territories who were not married to their mothers.,3
"Can she confirm today that it will be remedied in this Bill The other issue is the exorbitant fee of £11,002, of which only £372 represents the administrative costs, charged for children born here or who have spent most of their lives here who are entitled to British citizenship but who have to register that entitlement because of their parents’ status.",3
"It benefited greatly from pre-legislative scrutiny, and it is important that the changes proposed by the committee should not be watered down and be properly resourced The proposed new points-based immigration system was considered by my noble friends Lord Paddick and Lady Smith and the noble Lords, Lord Horam and Lord Green.",3
"They have suffered reputational damage, immigration problems and stops at international ports, with no means of defending themselves or their families, who are of course also affected.",3
"Will the Government implement a durable solution to their immigration status and direct a new judge-led inquiry into the UK’s actions We note that the police are to be, “awarded the power to arrest individuals who are wanted by trusted international partners”, in an extradition and provisional arrest Bill.",3
"It is principally directed to mitigating its loss I regard the measures to, “improve the justice system’s response to foreign national offenders”, as largely a red herring.",3
"Deportation is already available in respect of serious offenders, but the Home Office’s record of deporting offenders is abysmal.",3
"It is far more important to implement existing deportation orders effectively than to rely on new measures to deter the return of those who have been deported We are promised a new regulator to scrutinise environmental policy and law, investigate complaints and take enforcement action.",3
"We have Europol, which is a massive improvement over Interpol in terms of efficient co-operation and speed; Eurojust, which allows co-operation between judges and courts; and access to the Schengen database of information to protect national security, border control and law enforcement The answer the noble Lord, Lord Callanan, gave to the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, on these points was wholly inadequate.",3
"Brexit poses a massive threat to the union, yet the Government ignore the threat of Scottish independence and the fact that the form of Brexit that might be implemented could be the most inimical possible to Scotland’s economic interests The Government seem prepared to threaten the union with Northern Ireland in their desperation to get Brexit done against an artificial and politically imposed deadline, seeking to reconcile the clearly conflicting goals of leaving the customs union, honouring the Good Friday agreement with no border between the Republic and Northern Ireland, and treating Northern Ireland as an intrinsic part of the UK.",3
"It seems that rehabilitation and measures to reduce the incidence of offending in the first place are going to take a relative back seat, even though that is potentially where the big savings lie and where the greatest benefits for achieving a safer society can be realised The Domestic Abuse Bill, which we welcome, is an opportunity to change domestic abuse from a criminal justice issue to one that is everyone’s business, tackled by health and social care, housing, education and employers, but insecure immigration status is often a tool of control used by perpetrators to abuse their partners and threaten them with deportation.",3
"We need safe reporting mechanisms, ensuring immigration enforcement is kept separate from the response to domestic abuse Domestic violence follows women into the workplace.",3
"I hope that the Government can respond The Government’s immigration Bill seeks to repeal EU free movement laws, so that the UK can bring in a more restrictive immigration and social security system for EU citizens after Brexit.",3
"The immigration Bill would undermine the UK’s ability to get a good Brexit outcome, as it would end the free movement rules which are a requirement of the single market membership that many feel is crucial to protect rights and jobs.",3
"This Bill also increases the risk of exploitation, as it paves the way for the Government to introduce their plans for low-skill visas for EU workers that allow workers to stay for only a short period in the UK.",3
Workers on such visas are likely to be employed in sectors where there is a low coverage of collective agreements and thus more likely to be subject to poorer conditions and low pay.,3
"Bad employers may be tempted to use workers’ insecure immigration status to force them to accept poor conditions A number of noble Lords spoke about immigration, including the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington.",3
"In my view, the Government have always sought to back both horses on immigration.",3
"On the other hand, the same Government continue to agree to as many people from outside the EU, whose number they can control, coming into the country as from within the EU, in respect of whom they say they need withdrawal from the EU to regain control of our borders.",3
"The Government could under EU law, within the general principles of freedom of movement, have registered migrant workers as they arrive or imposed a time limit on any stay without work.",3
"I suspect that those who believe that, following Brexit, the Government will reduce net migration will be disappointed, even though the Government will no doubt continue to try to give the impression that that is the objective that they are pursuing The noble Lord, Lord Horam, spoke about Brexit enabling us to reset policies on immigration and mentioned the policy—or was it an aspiration?—of reducing net migration to tens of thousands a year.",3
"Certainly, the Government’s proposals for speeding up and shortening the planning application process, which will put more pressure on understaffed local authorities, do not suggest that they think we need to keep a close watch on and control over future building development My noble friend Lady Lister of Burtersett raised concerns over the position of EU citizens, settled status, asylum seekers and fees in respect of children.",3
"Gentleman will understand the distinction between deportation, which happens to foreign national offenders, and removal, which happens to those who are immigration offenders.",3
"That is an important principle, which the Government support, because we want people to have an adequate level of income that will enable them to integrate into society.",3
"It is difficult to see how the wrongs of unlawful deportation, where some of those affected have died in poverty overseas, can be made right.",3
"As Liberal Democrats, we argued when the scheme was being discussed in this House that, as a recent High Court case has found, forcing landlords to carry out immigration checks on potential tenants is likely to be discriminatory, not just against immigrants but against black and minority ethnic Britons.",3
"Why are the Government appealing against that finding when they say that they are dismantling the hostile environment Can the Minister also explain why Windrush generation individuals who received settled status without being given the ability to prove it are now being asked to prove that they are of “good character” and that, if they fail to do so, they could be refused right of abode, settlement or citizenship?",3
"My Lords, this Bill was intended to do everything necessary at present to counter terrorism and protect our borders.",3
"On border control, I will make three points.",3
"First, the list published in Hansard, in response to Written Questions I have put down periodically since 2012, of Home Office immigration officials who have been sentenced to often long periods of imprisonment, up to eight or nine years, for misconduct in public office—that is what Hansard describes their offence as being, in most cases—now includes over 50 such cases.",3
"Secondly, there is still no record, for online access at entry and departure points, of other passports held by UK passport holders.",3
"Thirdly, the Home Office seems to have been caught by surprise, with the Home Secretary having had to hurry back from holiday, by the sudden increase in the number of illegal immigrants who have sought to travel to the UK across the Channel in small boats.",3
"In some ways, it seemed a very odd occasion, with a Government that do not have a majority bringing forward a programme that does not seem to be implementable and a Government, moreover, which have been at odds with Parliament over the illegal Prorogation as well as over one of the central aspects of their Brexit policy.",3
"We are all grateful in particular to the noble Baroness, Lady Helic, for bringing in so many important foreign policy issues on which we ought to be concentrating, and I certainly hope we have that opportunity in the future.",3
"If there is a deal, what do the Government envisage as a transition period?",3
What do the Government now envisage?,3
"Do they envisage a 20-month transition or, say, just 14 months, which would go on to the end of December 2020?",3
"He gave a wildly optimistic picture of striking new trade arrangements, helping UK businesses to expand into new markets and maintaining the UK’s leading position as, “the number one destination in Europe for foreign direct investment”.—[Official Report, 15/10/19; col.37.]",3
"When we talk about foreign direct investment, we know that a lot of that investment is linked to the fact that we are part of the European single market.",3
Some people have said that it means re-erecting a border in the Irish Sea.,3
"For example, how would the immigration Bill announced in the Queen’s Speech that aims to end freedom of movement affect the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic?",3
"I campaigned ardently for Better Together in the referendum campaign and I live in Northumberland, not far from the border.",3
The thought of that becoming an international border in the future fills me with absolute dismay.,2
"Again, if there were an independent Scotland with its own immigration policy, I do not see how you could avoid some sort of border control in that circumstance, which would be tragic given the history of our union and the fact that so many people, like me, have mixed heritage and therefore a British loyalty rather than simply a loyalty to a country of the UK I would like to see the choice given back to the people.",4
"Once free movement has ended, transitional immigration arrangements will be in place until the new skills-based immigration system is introduced from January 2021.",3
"The intention is to minimise disruption at the border and avoid a cliff edge, providing initial continuity for EEA and Swiss citizens and for businesses.",3
"Such citizens will be granted leave to enter for a period of three months, automatically, upon arrival at the border.",3
"This means that they will be able to cross the border much as now, including using e-passport gates.",3
They will not be questioned routinely or have their passport stamped.,3
"This leave will allow them to work, study or visit for short periods as we transition to the new skills-based immigration system to be introduced from 2021 For many individuals, a single three-month period of leave will be sufficient.",3
"Those who are the subject of exclusion or deportation orders or other specified decisions will not benefit from the automatic leave provisions, and Border Force officers will be able to cancel automatic leave where an individual’s presence in the UK is deemed to be non-conducive.",3
"These arrangements are a contingency plan, necessary only in a no-deal scenario, to allow us to transition smoothly from the end of free movement to the future skills-based immigration system The order also makes changes to support the EU settlement scheme in both a deal and a no-deal scenario.",3
"It also ensures that scheme leave granted to a Crown servant, to a permanent member of the British Council who is an EEA or Swiss national or to a member of Her Majesty’s forces will not lapse as a result of an overseas posting.",3
The order facilitates overseas applications to the scheme and clarifies that scheme applicants will not need to pay the immigration health charge These are important measures to support the delivery of the EU settlement scheme and our no-deal contingency plan.,3
"In addition to the questions raised by the sub-committee as to whether immigration officials conducting exit checks in foreign countries to establish whether someone has the right to enter the UK before they depart will be notified of such a change, and whether confusion will be created by deviating from the standard EU format, would a potential delay to the UK’s departure from the EU for 12 months or more require the UK to adopt the new EU design despite what is contained in this instrument The other issue is the withdrawal of the UK not only from the Dublin regulation but from the Eurodac regulation.",3
"Currently, under the Dublin regulation, an asylum seeker must seek asylum in the first safe country arrived in.",3
"The Eurodac regulation covers the use and operation of the Eurodac biometric database, which notifies participating member states of a match if a person has been fingerprinted as an asylum seeker in connection with an illegal crossing into a country participating in the Dublin regulation.",3
"My understanding is that this instrument makes the necessary legislative changes to acknowledge that the UK will no longer be party either to the Dublin regulation or the Eurodac regulation, as the UK will no longer have access to the mechanism for returning asylum seekers to the first country they arrived in; nor will they be able to establish by fingerprints that they sought asylum in another safe country, as the UK will no longer have access to that database.",3
Will the Minister explain the practical implications of the Home Office’s response to the sub- committee that asylum claims may still be deemed inadmissible to the UK if the claimants have already been recognised as a refugee or could have claimed asylum elsewhere?,3
"How, in the absence of the Eurodac database, will the UK establish this If EU member states are no longer obliged to accept transfers from the UK under the Dublin regulation, what is the Home Office going to do with those asylum seekers?",3
"If by some other means the Home Office determines that an asylum seeker could have claimed asylum elsewhere, or has already been recognised as a refugee elsewhere, they are presumably genuine refugees and so cannot be returned to their country of origin.",3
"As the UK will no longer be a member of the Dublin regulation, presumably they cannot be transferred to the EU member state where they first sought asylum either.",4
"As a signatory to the 1951 UN refugee convention and the ECHR, we are committed to continuing to fulfil our responsibility.",4
Our attitude is not changing towards asylum seekers because of Brexit.,3
"She will know, because I have said it before, that in 2017, the UK received the fifth highest number of asylum claims in the EU, and since 2016, we have accepted more Dublin transfers than we have returned, as I referred to earlier.",3
"In the year ending June 2017, we resettled more than 16,000 refugees from outside the EU, more than any other EU member state and more than a fifth of all resettlement to the EU.",3
"Since the start of 2010, the UK has granted more than 51,000 children resettlement, refugee status or alternative forms of protection The noble Lord, Lord Paddick, definitely asked about admissibility, and I think the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, referred to it as well.",3
"Asylum should always be claimed in the first country that a migrant reaches, as the noble Baroness said.",3
"It is vital that our new system does not encourage asylum-seekers who have already reached a safe country to choose to move elsewhere, so we will continue to assess each asylum claim on its individual merits, as set out in the Home Secretary’s Statement to the House on 7 January If an individual has travelled through a safe third country and failed to claim asylum, that will be taken into account in assessing the credibility of their claim.",3
"This is a widely held principle accepted by the UNHCR, and it is important to send a clear message to smugglers and traffickers and discourage secondary movements.",3
"The standards for protection and assistance will in no way be diminished by the UK’s exit from the EU On returning asylum-seekers, the UK is attempting to negotiate an ongoing EU-UK readmission agreement which will replace the current Dublin return capability, and this would ideally be underpinned by a biometric system like Eurodac, although clearly it will not be identical to Eurodac.",3
"How much more difficult must it be if you are a migrant with insecure status, or if you believe your status is insecure, which might be part of the issue?",2
"In my view, curtailing a spousal visa when a partner claims the marriage has ended amounts to complicity in control and coercion.",3
It is restricted to immigrants on a spousal visa and is too short.,3
It does not apply to asylum seekers and there is no means through the asylum system to access specialist women’s services.,3
"It seems that some police forces share the details of victims with the Home Office for the purposes of immigration control, which is shocking.",3
"We now face, within Britain as well as elsewhere, a surge of “illiberal democracy”, as Prime Minister Orbán of Hungary has labelled it, founded on the exploitation of popular fears, antagonism to foreigners and international institutions, the denigration of domestic opponents and a sweeping disregard for consistency or evidence.",3
"After all, one of his campaign promises was that Mexico would pay to build a wall along the United States’ southern border.",3
"We were also assured that leaving the European Union would resolve the problem of immigration, even though in no year did the majority of immigrants arriving come from inside the EU.",3
"The leave campaign promised groups within the Asian community that closing off European immigration would leave more space for others to arrive Now we are warned that the will of the people—a phrase that authoritarian and anti-democratic Governments have long been fond of—requires a much harder, nastier and domestically damaging Brexit, because there can be no reconsideration or turning back.",3
"I will come to that later The priority remains to help all those facing asylum destitution, especially those due to receive the 14-day notice-to-quit letter followed by the seven-day lock change notice.",3
"The process of submitting new evidence for a refused asylum claim is lengthy and complicated for most, and they might not have an option to return because of fear of persecution.",3
I am going to mention a number of cases that have been presented to me by asylum charities.,3
The Conservative Government have none the less retained their basic inhumanity in the asylum process.,3
"Since last week, they have been ruthlessly rolling out their privatised hostile environment in Scotland’s largest city Courageous women like Mariam, who has fled abuse in Eritrea but been refused refugee protection by the asylum system, should never have received a notice to quit.",3
"Do we leave people like Mariam on the streets, with their mental health going through the floor, to be a sitting target for traffickers or exploiters, when the outgoing Prime Minister said that tackling trafficking was a top priority?",3
"For a woman who has fled her country to seek shelter and asylum in the UK, two men in uniform visiting the house with letters will mean something completely different from what it would perhaps mean to us.",3
Her hopes were raised that she had got refugee status.,3
"This time, the letter wrongly stated that her asylum claim was refused and that she must leave her accommodation.",3
"In fact, she has an ongoing asylum claim and is due to attend a further submissions appointment in Liverpool on 4 October 2019.",3
"This woman’s claim for asylum is based on her nationality and the fact that, as a Pentecostal Christian, she would be at risk of persecution should she return Another case presented to me is a 72-year-old gentleman who is an Iraqi national but has lived most of his life in Syria.",4
"As a landlord, Serco is ill-equipped to pass judgment on someone’s asylum status.",3
Walking unannounced into someone’s accommodation and rummaging through their private belongings does not make that person an immigration officer.,3
The people Serco is attempting to evict are not subject to deportation orders.,3
"I have a letter, which I will place in the Library, from Susan Aitken, the leader of Glasgow City Council, and a note of the meeting of local authorities passing on their concerns about asylum accommodation contracts and processes.",3
"It is my concern that Serco is advertising the fact that the reason why it needs to remove asylum seekers from their accommodation is so that it can hand back the keys to the original landlords, which does not seem to me to be an acceptable reason There is very real concern from local government that the transition deadline will not be met in some areas and that contingency accommodation may have to be used.",3
"The distribution of asylum seekers across the country is very uneven, with some areas of high concentration, including Glasgow.",3
"In their view, the Home Office is failing to address issues for which it has responsibility and seems unable to provide up-to-date data on the number and locations of asylum seekers.",3
"Friend the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East, the fact that asylum seeker lock-change evictions are going ahead has resulted in some local authorities suggesting that they would not want to participate in that sort of process.",3
"Local authorities participating in the dispersal programme are still waiting for the Home Office response to their request for funding, and they see no evidence that that has been taken to Her Majesty’s Treasury I think it would be fair to say that we have a number of questions about what is going on in relation both to the contracts, and to this inhumane move to subject asylum seekers to lock-change evictions and make them homeless.",3
When is she next coming to Glasgow to discuss the asylum accommodation contract with asylum charities and the council?,3
Will she confirm whether refused case management and immigration enforcement teams are planning to start working through the over-staying list?,3
"Can the Minister provide an assurance that no one in the over-staying group will be visited by immigration enforcement in their asylum accommodation, purely because they are classed as an over-stayer As a result of what has been put forward, the Home Office is required to make a decision.",3
"I will come to that issue in a moment As leader of his party, that person excelled at pointing the finger at migrants, intentionally misleading the British public about EU citizens, who include the 1.3 million British people exercising their freedom to live and work across the EU, and conflating them with refugees seeking sanctuary in fear for their lives.",3
That person and his kind—I include the current incumbent of the White House in that—repeatedly use inflammatory and demonising language about refugees and migrants that is meant to instil fear.,3
"I would argue that large swathes of the print media have enabled that, which is compounded by social media I am proud that, in the wake of the second world war, the UK helped to draft, and was one of the first signatories to, the UN convention on refugees, so that anyone, anywhere, could claim refuge from persecution.",4
"We must make sure that communities with migrant populations are appropriately resourced and supported, so that the pressure on services is mitigated, migrant and indigenous communities get to know each other, and employers are prohibited from undercutting wages.",3
"I would like to talk about a couple of refugees, Samia and Marzia, and say why they came to the UK and how I got to know them.",4
Samia is a refugee from Syria.,3
"Although she had been granted refugee status fairly quickly, which is not everyone’s experience—I would like to raise that point with the Minister—she was no longer eligible for temporary accommodation because of issues with her residence permit.",3
"My office deals with a number of immigration and asylum claims, and I cannot speak highly enough of what they do.",3
We do not hear enough about those kinds of stories or how refugees are a net benefit to this country I first met Marzia at an International Women’s Day event in Oldham five years ago.,3
"The asylum system is harsh.” Now Marzia is a British citizen, and I was delighted to be invited to her citizenship ceremony.",3
Her views on the asylum system are scathing.,2
She says: “We have had some refugees who have waited 15 years for a decision about their status.,3
"She has even written a book about not just her life in Afghanistan and the circumstances that led her to leave, but her experience of the asylum system.",3
She wants people to understand the propaganda in the tabloids and increasingly online We must remember why the refugee convention exists and think about what we would want if our families were affected.,3
"That is why I am calling on the Government to ensure compassion, dignity and humanity in the asylum system; not to let people languish for years in no man’s land without determining their status; to ensure there are funded English classes to help people integrate in their new homes and communities; to enable people to work while they await their status; to support local authorities through a new migrant impact fund to ensure asylum seekers and refugees are properly supported and integrated into their new communities; and especially to fast-track the process of reuniting children with their families.",3
"As Marzia says, “I am a refugee but I am a human being, like you.”",3
"Gentleman that we need to see progress On 9 February, I visited some of the refugee camps just over the channel with Care4Calais—a charity that distributes clothes, sleeping bags, tents and other necessities.",3
"I cannot forget the harsh conditions in which the refugees there find themselves, with little electricity or hot food, no hot water, no heating, no privacy and the constant background of cold and damp.",2
I heard at first hand from refugees in Calais about the life-threatening situations they had fled.,3
Many of the refugees were young—still in their early teens—but already they had experienced horrors in their lives that many of us would find difficult to imagine.,3
The terrifying steps these refugees will take to escape torture and persecution are telling.,3
I met a family who had crossed the sea in winter in a tiny dinghy the size of one of the rowing boats in St James’s Park We must ask ourselves what prompts people to take such extreme actions.,3
"In 2018, the UK received five asylum applications for every 10,000 people living in the UK, while the European average is 14.",3
"In this context, it seems nothing less than cruel to block the reunion of refugee children with their families.",3
"This right already exists for adult refugees in the UK, who are able to bring their families over to join them having been successful in their asylum application.",4
It is therefore perverse that the same right is not given to child refugees One of my own team in Parliament is part of a family who fled torture in Algeria in the 1960s.,3
"Her family are proud of their integration and achievements in this country: proud to be British, proud to contribute economically and socially, and proud to have done well in their chosen professions.",3
"Although the need for family reunion has greatly increased, the Ministry of Justice has been prevented from bringing justice to refugee children.",3
"Refugee family reunion has been described by the Government as a straightforward immigration matter, but there is clear evidence to show that this is not the case In its report, “Not so straightforward”, the British Red Cross argues that a substantial percentage of refugee family reunion case are highly complex.",3
"Yet because of the removal of legal aid, refugees wishing to reunite with their families must apply without legal help or must themselves pay to hire legal advisers.",3
"Of course, refugees are rarely able to hire solicitors or legal advisers on their own due to financial insecurity.",3
"Instead, they are left to navigate a fiendishly complicated system that sometimes requires DNA evidence and documents that have been long since destroyed in the rush to escape war or torture If we are to be the open, civilised and tolerant country that we aspire to be, we urgently need to make refugee family reunion possible.",3
Part of this would include the Ministry of Justice committing to a statutory funding regime for legal assistance for refugee family reunion cases.,3
"It is a week during which we celebrate the rights enshrined in the refugee convention—as has been pointed out, we helped to draft it—and also commit to defending the principle that states should provide shelter for those fleeing persecution from other countries.",3
"Members have pointed out, it is also a week during which we celebrate the huge benefits that refugees can bring to their new homes if they are given the chance to flourish.",3
"It is often said in this Chamber, and it has been said again today, that we have a strong track record of offering sanctuary to refugees, and I agree, although the hon.",3
"Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams) was quite right to point out some of the challenges posed by certain political and tabloid voices, and the need for all of us to be leaders in defending the rights of refugees.",3
We must also say thank you to our refugee community for the massive contribution they make in all walks of life World Refugee Day is also a good time to thank all the organisations and individuals up and down the UK that work relentlessly to support refugees and campaign on their behalf.,3
"It is a source of lots of information and ideas for me, and I wish it well as it launches its own refugee festival today Finally on the subject of Refugee Week, like the hon.",3
"Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon), I am pleased to see the Minister for Immigration here today because—and this may cause shockwaves in the Chamber—I too want to commend her and the Home Office for what they have announced this week about refugee resettlement.",3
"Just yesterday, the UNHCR reported that the population of displaced citizens has now reached 70.8 million people, and 25.9 million of them are refugees, which is almost double the number from a decade ago.",3
"The UNHCR estimates that 1.4 million refugees need to be resettled, but last year only 81,300 places were offered by 29 states—a gap of 90% that is getting bigger rather than smaller.",3
"Members have said that we can, and should, do more with the Dubs amendment, with relocations from Europe, and with the asylum system, and I agree The key part of my hon.",3
"Many of those who apply to come to the UK under the refugee family reunion rules—and those who would apply under the expanded rules that we seek through the Bill—are themselves refugees, and it makes sense for them to be alongside their refugee families in the UK, rather than isolated in refugee camps.",3
"More fundamentally, however, family reunion is about the rights of those refugees who are already here.",3
"The convention relating to the status of refugees ensures that refugees can work, study, and access housing and social security on the same basis as the host country’s citizens What could be more essential for someone trying to rebuild their life than the presence of their family?",4
"Member for Strangford said, the Government do allow family reunion, and last year there were 5,806 cases of partners and children who were able to join refugees here.",3
"We welcome that, but our refugee family reunion rules remain more restrictive than international best practice, and more restrictive than leading refugee organisations would wish As the hon.",3
"How can it ever be right that someone’s 18-year-old daughter cannot join her refugee parents here, but her 17 and 15-year-old siblings can?",3
"How can we say to refugee children living among us in the UK that even though they know where their parents are, we will not allow them to come here In response to such questions, the Government generally point to alternative routes in the immigration rules, but as everyone knows, those alternatives are more complicated, much more restrictive, and they come with far fewer rights than refugee family reunion.",3
"Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Gill Furniss) said, it is great that now and again there are exceptional cases and exceptional results are granted, but we want all refugees in the circumstances set out in the Bill to be able to access refugee family reunion rules in a straightforward manner In response to what the Home Affairs Committee called the “perverse” rule that stops children sponsoring their parents to come in under family reunion rules, the Home Office plays the “pull factor” card—an argument I hate.",3
"Member for Bromley and Chislehurst said, that argument is not founded on evidence, and it runs contrary to everything that leading international refugee organisations tell us.",3
"To my mind, it is also totally immoral because when looked at from a different angle, it essentially makes an example of refugee children who are already here.",2
"It says to refugee children, “We must ensure that you live separately from your parents so as to discourage others from coming here”, which is a brutal way for any Department to operate Such reasoning is also deeply flawed.",3
"If I had fled my country of origin and discovered that my child had ended up as a refugee in a third country, I would move heaven and earth to join them there.",4
"If I could not do it through family reunion rules, I would pay people smugglers or buy a dinghy to do it myself.",3
"Refusing to recognise the right of child refugees to sponsor their parents does not stop people using unsafe illegal routes—on the contrary, it forces more people to use them—and my hon.",3
I know from my experience as an immigration solicitor how complicated those applications can sometimes be.,3
"The issue is set out in an excellent report entitled “Not so straightforward” by the British Red Cross, which notes “the need for qualified legal support in refugee family reunion” People can still get that support in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and they should have it in England and Wales as well My hon.",4
Members that the Scottish National party has called an Opposition day debate on immigration next week and some other Scottish colleagues will see me return to Westminster Hall the week after—I am not quite gone yet The hon.,3
"In Lambeth this week, I saw a number of resettled refugees, including one young Muslim woman from Syria who had been resettled in an apartment in the synagogue.",3
"Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough cited a particular case, but over the past five years we have granted over 26,000 family reunion visas to family members of refugees in the UK.",3
"Where there are serious and compelling circumstances, refugees can sponsor adult dependent relatives living overseas to join them when, owing to age, illness or disability, that person requires long-term personal care that can be provided only by relatives in the UK Child sponsors is an incredibly controversial issue and I am sure that it will provoke Members into seeking to intervene on me.",3
We know that those people have fallen prey to organised crime gangs and people smugglers and that they have paid enormous sums of money to have their lives put at risk.,2
"I hope that the Government will come forward with a strategy that will not just improve the environment, but create green jobs, and improve health and wellbeing and children’s development As others have said, the climate emergency will set up huge population displacement across the world, and the immigration Bill needs to set the foundations for how our response includes a system that affords people rights and dignity, and that meets the needs of business and employers.",3
"After all, we have already tried a points-based system for tier 1 and tier 2 visas, but it was abandoned, so what will be different this time The Australian points-based system supports a young mobile labour force.",3
"We need to support the reunion of families and give them the opportunity to integrate, and we need them to be able to avoid destitution, including by affording asylum seekers the right to work.",3
I conclude by asking Ministers to report to the House urgently on what is happening to the asylum and migration integration fund.,3
The report provides a stark insight into how the current immigration system is impacting on the lives of children and forcing them into poverty and towards destitution.,3
"People seeking asylum in the UK are effectively prohibited from working and, until recently, the Home Office’s target time for decisions on asylum cases was six months.",3
Yet immigration statistics released in May revealed that the number of main applicants waiting over six months for a decision on their claim had reached 46%.,3
"The system is certainly not working—at least, not for asylum seekers A large number have good qualifications but are banned from working, making it all but impossible to provide adequate care for their families.",2
"The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recognised this failing, stating that allowing asylum seekers in the UK greater access to the labour market would not only increase individuals’ self-reliance but help to provide skills that the economy needs The UK has the lengthiest restrictions in Europe on people seeking asylum gaining the right to work.",3
"Spain, the Netherlands and even the USA allow work after six months; in Germany and Switzerland, it is three months; in Canada, asylum seekers can find work from day one.",4
"In this country, asylum seekers must wait a minimum of 12 months before they are given the right to work.",3
There is public support for looking at asylum seekers’ right to work more holistically and in a way that better respects their human dignity.,3
"Will the Minister commit to a review of government policy and allow all people seeking asylum and their adult dependants the right to find a job and support themselves The Not Seen, Not Heard report illustrates the effects on women of being left in poverty.",3
"A significant longer-term barrier to work for many people seeking asylum, and another which disproportionately affects women, is a dearth of free and accessible classes in English for speakers of other languages, commonly referred to as ESOL provision.",3
How can we expect people to integrate if we fail to support them to learn English?,2
"It is entirely unacceptable for the quality of English language teaching for refugees and asylum seekers to depend on what part of the UK they happen to be in The Government’s 2018 Integrated Communities Strategy Green Paper contained welcome proposals and acknowledged the vital importance of English for integration, while last year’s immigration White Paper committed to, “an ambitious and well-funded English language strategy to ensure that everyone in this country, especially those with newly recognised refugee status, are supported to speak the same language” Someone should tell that to Boris Johnson who, only three days ago, demanded that immigrants should learn English to integrate better.",3
"As that report makes clear, because families are offered insufficient financial support due to their immigration status, children are bearing the brunt, too often living in abject levels of poverty.",3
"By their inaction, the Government are flouting their commitments to children under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child I have highlighted two areas that could improve the lives of many people: granting asylum seekers the right to work and increased and accessible provision of ESOL and childcare.",3
Urgent action is needed from the Government to reform our inhumane immigration system.,2
"In the same area, unregistered migrants in Turkey have been rounded up and many have been returned to areas where death is a great possibility.",3
"On the other side of the Atlantic, on the Mexico-United States border, we have pictures of a little girl drowning in her father’s arms and we read of the President’s intention to round up unregistered immigrants.",3
We must be in contact with the United States authorities to bring an end to such terrible conditions But would the UK treat its asylum seekers any better?,4
"How will Brexit affect the work of the churches, especially the Catholic Church, and their pan-European activity to help refugees?",3
"They know no borders, but the UK is now guilty, with the whole attitude of the hostile environment, of digging ditches instead of building bridges.",3
"We must look at the Home Office, and the decisions that create heartache when families are threatened with deportation.",3
"It is made up of refugees and friends: there are about 40 or 50 refugees there, from about 26 countries.",3
"We need a change in immigration regulations, a change that would transform lives.",2
We could remove the threat of deportation on reaching 18 years of age.,3
"My Lords, I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham for this debate and for the contributions of other noble Lords this evening—and to Project 17 for highlighting the implications for children of the Government’s immigration policy I appreciate that this is a difficult situation for the Home Office and for local authorities.",3
"I have to take issue with Project 17’s report, which refers to: “The government’s commitment to creating a ‘hostile environment’ for migrants” It was supposed to be about creating a hostile environment for illegal migrants, not all migrants.",3
"However, the reality is that the Government have created a hostile environment for all undocumented migrants I do not know whether the Minister will repeat what she has said on previous occasions.",3
"As anyone who has studied business management will tell you, culture is the most difficult aspect of any organisation to change, and the evidence suggests that the culture at the Home Office continues to be one of deporting given the slightest discrepancy in an undocumented migrant’s application, and of imposing no recourse to public funds where the Home Office is unable to deport them.",3
"As my noble friend Lord Roberts of Llandudno said, one piece of evidence that the culture still exists is the fact that more than 50% of appeals against Home Office immigration decisions are successful I fully accept that the Government cannot allow unfettered access to the UK to all who want to come here, and that there must be rules on immigration and thorough investigations into whether an undocumented migrant meets those rules.",3
"This is about providing a fair system that allows equality of arms to the applicant and the Home Office and does not lean on the applicant, the applicant’s family and, most of all, the children in the hope that they will give up and leave As the report clearly shows, the in many cases devastating consequences for the children caught up in these cases are a result of the Government’s approach and the Home Office’s culture of, “If in doubt, deport—or, if you can’t deport yet, make it so difficult that they’ll want to leave”.",3
This report is about the symptoms of immigration policy.,2
"In the equation of, “How many votes will this policy win us and how many will it lose us?”, the cost-benefit analysis of supporting and being decent to undocumented migrants may well come out as a negative.",3
It is therefore not just the children who are not seen and not heard but the undocumented migrants as well who have no voice That may be one reason why the Liberal Democrats are not the most popular party.,2
"That is why we believe that asylum seekers should be able to work if the Home Office has been unable to resolve their case within six months, so that they can support themselves and their family without having to rely on the state, as the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Invergowrie, and my noble friend Lord Roberts said.",3
"All children should have access to the support that they need to keep them safe and well, regardless of their immigration status.",3
"In particular, it focuses on those families who are destitute because they cannot claim benefits, or access social housing, due to their immigration status.",3
"Quite often local authorities are supporting children at a time when things in their parents’ lives are not as they should be, including the parents’ immigration status.",3
"I note the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Russell, about the LGA’s next campaign The Government’s position on no recourse to public funds is simply that those seeking to establish their family life in the UK must do so on a basis that prevents burdens on the taxpayer and promotes integration.",3
"To address the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Invergowrie, successive Governments have adopted the general position that persons subject to immigration control should not be entitled to access public funds until they have obtained indefinite leave to remain, reflecting the strength of their connection to the UK.",3
"There are, of course, exceptions for certain groups, such as refugees granted temporary leave to remain for a period before they qualify for settlement On that basis, no recourse to public funds is a standard condition applied to those staying here with a temporary immigration status.",3
"This is an obvious and essential requirement of immigration control However, there are sometimes barriers to individuals leaving the UK; for instance, the difficulty of obtaining documentation from their own national authorities.",3
"Therefore, families with no recourse to public funds due to the lawful operation of immigration control can still be supported by local authorities when their individual circumstances and the needs of their children require this.",3
"First, asylum-seeking families with children can receive support under Section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 if they cannot provide for their own needs.",3
Eligibility can include those granted refugee status and children of immigrants and refugees who are receiving support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.,3
"All three and four year-olds, regardless of their or their parents’ immigration status, are entitled to 15 hours a week of free early education for 38 weeks of the year until they reach compulsory school age.",3
"If I can, I will write to him on the Green Paper I also note, and support, the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Invergowrie, about the importance of the English language for integration; it is vital.",3
"Most noble Lords, including the noble Lords, Lord Roberts, Lord Paddick and Lord Watson, talked about asylum seekers not being able to work.",3
Successful asylum seekers are of course entitled to work.,3
"Local authorities keep data on the number of migrant families they support, and this includes the number of children.",3
"Friend for his sterling personal contribution to securing the full Brexit of our dreams, but may I remind him that there is an organisation still frustrating our power to control our own borders and laws?",3
That is a case where we deported a foreign national offender who had been sentenced to five and a half years’ imprisonment for very serious immigration offences—facilitating other people to break our immigration laws.,3
The Court has said that deportation was unlawful.,3
"Also very disturbing is the gradual increase in numbers coming across the channel in rickety boats and tiny inflatables, dodging the big ships, whenever the weather allows.",3
"As I said in Committee at the beginning of this month, 416 migrants exploited fine weather to make the crossing in one day, arriving all along the south coast.",3
"Migrants are risking, and in some cases losing, their lives because the authorities are known to be useless at enforcing the law, and the biggest beneficiaries are the traffickers Late legal challenges are also undermining efforts to remove migrants who have no right to remain, with flights that are cancelled and then bad headlines that encourage yet more attempts to enter the UK illegally.",3
"We need to have the facts before us and have a light shone upon them, giving the Government every opportunity to explain regularly how they are making the progress that most of the country wants Of course, we all have individual cases where we want to see generous Immigration Rules and enforcement—staff for our businesses or domestic workers, attracting lower wages than we might pay to British equivalents; reliable-looking tenants; or daughters-in-law awaiting visas—but the aggregate is very damaging to the public trust, as we have seen in the north of England.",3
"They come because we make people from everywhere welcome in our society; have strong, well-enforced laws on equality and modern slavery; and provide generous education, healthcare and housing for migrants as well as to natives.",4
"It does not have, and does not see itself as having, a brief to advise on the scale of illegal immigration; nor are its members experts on the level of compliance with Immigration Rules, the effectiveness across the agencies involved, value for money or overall expenditure and resourcing in this important area.",3
"Indeed, the Minister might want to consider the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, in Committee and ask the MAC, from its expert perspective, to recommend improvements to the policing of the immigration system Given the awkward history of enforcement, which I have to say goes back to my own time in home affairs at Downing Street in the 1990s, I can well believe that our proposal for a report six months after the passage of the Bill might seem unpalatable to Ministers and their civil servants, who are all trying to do their best.",3
I too am sceptical about the Government’s ability to enforce immigration law in general and the end of free movement in particular.,3
"Indeed, as I have previously argued, there is evidence that, rather than “taking back control”, the Government have made the UK border more porous At previous stages of this Bill, I have raised the issue of EEA and Swiss nationals, who will continue to be able to enter the UK using airport e-passport gates and who will benefit from visa-free entry to the UK, officially for six months at the end of the transition period, along with the nationals of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and the USA—the so-called B5JSSK countries I am very grateful to the Minister for meeting me face to face—a rare treat—along with several officials, who joined us virtually.",3
"The point of raising this issue now is to have on the record the fact that the Government’s approach to immigration contains significant loopholes, which are as follows First, there will be no digital record of the immigration status of EEA and Swiss nationals, or those of the other B5JSSK countries that I have listed, visiting the UK under the six-month visa-free arrangements.",3
"This can be checked—for example, by landlords, in order to fulfil their right-to-rent obligations to ensure that they do not rent property to those who are in the UK illegally.",3
"The Government have no plans to change this situation other than an ambition that this will happen at some time in the future Secondly, there will be no way of tracking EEA, Swiss or other B5JSSK nationals once they have arrived in the UK, as no information will be recorded as to where they are going to be staying, there will be no stamp in their passport and there will be no way of establishing whether they have left the UK when or before the six-month limit has been reached Thirdly, in order to comply with the law—even though there is no way of enforcing it—all an EEA or Swiss national, or a national of one of the other B5JSSK countries, needs to do is take a day trip on the Eurostar to Lille, for example, in order to be legally eligible to stay for another six months.",3
"At the end of that period, the landlord can continue to rent the property to the EEA or Swiss national, or to one of these other nationals, provided they produce another ticket, boarding pass, travel booking or “Any other documentary evidence which establishes the date of arrival in the UK in the last six months.” Fifthly, the Government cannot provide any details of the electronic travel authorisations, or ETAs, mentioned in the Government’s immigration plans under the heading “The border of the future”, or of how that system will operate.",3
"The Government claim that it will “allow security checks to be conducted and more informed decisions taken on information obtained at an earlier stage, as to whether individuals should be allowed to travel to the UK.” In the meantime, and for the foreseeable future, the UK could be vulnerable to such individuals entering the UK—without checks or a visa—through the e-passport gates Every national of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea or the USA used to hand in a landing card and be questioned by a Border Force officer at the UK border to establish where they were going to stay, how long they were staying and whether they had the means to sustain themselves without working illegally.",3
"I am told that about 3,000 US nationals a year used to be turned away at the border, but these individuals can now use the e-passport gates, almost always unchallenged.",3
I understand that the reason the B5JSSK nationals were added to those who could use the e-passport gates was to better manage the queues at the UK border.,3
"Allowing people through the UK border more quickly by not checking whether they are entering the UK legitimately does not seem to be “taking back control” of our borders From 1 January, EEA and Swiss nationals will be able to enter the UK in the same way, even though free movement is supposed to be at an end.",3
"She will understand that I cannot pre-empt these, but I am sure they will become clear in due course The guidance will make it clear to immigration enforcement officers that no enforcement action should be taken in respect of those EEA citizens who can apply for the EU settlement scheme until the deadline of 30 June 2021.",3
I hope I can provide at least some assurances in these areas Enforcing the UK’s immigration laws is critical to a functioning immigration system and effectively implementing the Government’s policies.,3
"Tackling illegal working, targeting those in the country illegally and removing dangerous foreign criminals is an absolute priority.",2
"In some cases, this has constrained its ability to return individuals, and this has been coupled with a noticeable increase in levels of abuse designed to delay and frustrate our processes, reducing the removals achieved In term of performance on deporting foreign criminals, more than 55,000 have been returned since 2010.",3
"To pick up on my noble friend Lord Hodgson’s point about returns from the EU, of the 3,791 foreign national offenders—FNOs—returned from the UK in the year ending June 2020, two-thirds were EU nationals.",3
"Despite logistical issues with flights in the current pandemic, the Home Office will continue to take these forward with routes currently available, and as further routes return The noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, made suggestions in Committee about illegal migrants destroying their documents and linking the issuing of visas to countries readmitting their own citizens.",3
Visas are a border and national security tool.,2
The UK keeps its visa system under regular review.,3
"On his point about restoring the detained fast-track system for some asylum claims, unfortunately this process had to be suspended following a finding by the courts that the fast-track procedure rules were unlawful.",3
"However, we continue to explore options on tightening up key elements of our immigration system, including around asylum, appeals and enforcement Finally, the noble Lord mentioned the difficulty of preventing EU visitors and non-visa nationals working while in this country.",3
"Illegal working, as noble Lords will know, is a key driver of illegal migration; it encourages people to break our immigration laws and provides the practical means for migrants to remain in the UK unlawfully.",2
This encourages people to take risks by putting their lives in the hands of unscrupulous people smugglers; it leaves them vulnerable to exploitative employers and results in businesses that are not playing by the rules undercutting legitimate businesses that are.,2
"It also negatively impacts on the wages of lawful workers and is linked to other labour market abuses such as tax evasion, breach of the national minimum wage and exploitative working conditions—including, of course, modern slavery in the most serious cases Immigration enforcement teams take the threat of illegal working extremely seriously and work with employers to deny illegal workers access to jobs by making it straightforward to check a worker’s status and entitlement as well as providing a range of charged-for training and advisory services.",3
"Any EEA national arriving to work or study will need to apply under our new system and obtain prior permission, just like any other non-visa nationals.",4
"For a number of reasons, I cannot do that, not least because I am not an immigration lawyer.",3
But it is not the case that UK nationals who wish to return to the UK from living in the EEA after 29 March 2022 will be required to abandon family members overseas.,3
"The Supreme Court has also endorsed our approach in setting an income requirement for family migration which prevents burdens on the taxpayer and ensures that migrant families can integrate into our communities The noble Baroness, Lady Lister of Burtersett, referred to something that I mentioned in Committee.",3
"It does not exist as noble Lords described, as the minimum income requirement is generally to be met from the UK national partner rather than from the foreign national partner I know that I shall not have reassured noble Lords, because many of them tell me that they are going to vote on this, but that is my explanation of the logic of what the Government are doing.",3
"The Canadian agreement, to which the Prime Minister refers glowingly, has, by the Government’s own admission, more than 400 restraints on free trade in services, and we see that reflected in this treaty—whether it is ending mutual recognition of most professional qualifications or the end of passporting for financial services.",3
"Not India, unless we allow many more Indian immigrants —ask Priti Patel of the likelihood of that.",3
And ask any small business about the relative costs of exporting to the EU and to the Far East and you will find that there is only one answer—and it does not support the Government’s argument On maintaining the unity of the United Kingdom—the third test for any Government—it is to me almost incredible that the Conservative and Unionist Party has erected a border down the Irish Sea and allowed the EU to dictate what goods we can trade across it.,3
"As of today, the UK has no foreign policy and no capacity to influence international events, or even standards-setting, as part of a single EU response.",3
"They had gathered to pay tribute to Alex Chow Tsz-lok, who died last November during the protest In the light of this continued crackdown, can the Minister confirm what steps the Government are taking to ensure that British national (overseas) passport holders can gain consular access in the British embassy should mistreatment of protesters continue?",3
"They are British nationals, even if they happen to be overseas.",4
"We have an absolute responsibility Previously, the Government claimed that the extension of the rights of BNO passport holders would contravene the joint declaration.",3
"As we have heard, they cited an immigration report by my noble and learned friend Lord Goldsmith, the former Attorney-General, as proof that it would be illegal.",3
"However, as my noble friend Lord Pendry and other noble Lords have referred to, in a recent letter to both the Home Secretary and the Foreign Secretary, my noble and learned friend Lord Goldsmith disputed the misrepresentation of this view and published fresh legal advice, stating that the UK Government would not “be in breach of any obligation undertaken in the joint declaration were it to resolve to extend full right of abode to BN(O) passport holders while continuing to honour their side of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.” I would like to hear from the Minister today whether the Government have given any consideration to extending the rights of BNO passport holders to include: working visas; or, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said, the minor act of extending the length of time that Hong Kong students can stay in the United Kingdom after completing their studies; or, more importantly—because this is about the security of these people—offering them full right of abode in the United Kingdom I hope that the Minister will also respond to the long-outstanding issue raised by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, of servicemen who have served this country.",3
"These have been backed up by a strong societal response conditioned by personal experiences of the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003 After the first confirmed case in late January, over the course of February and March the Hong Kong Government introduced a number of significant measures, including: the suspension or scaling back of flights, trains, ferries and buses between Hong Kong and mainland China; the closure of most border crossings with mainland China; and from 19 March—as the noble Lord, Lord Collins, specifically mentioned—a compulsory 14-day quarantine for all travellers entering Hong Kong.",3
"For Hong Kong residents, including foreign nationals who live in Hong Kong, this quarantine can take place at home.",3
Let me say from the outset that the obligations of the UK Government towards Hong Kong residents with British national (overseas) status is something we take very seriously.,4
"As noble Lords will recall, British national (overseas) status was created in 1985 for people in Hong Kong who would lose their British dependent territory citizenship in 1997 when sovereignty was handed to China.",3
"As of February 2020, there were 349,881 British national (overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong, out of an estimated 2.9 million people eligible for such status.",4
"As my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has said, the British national (overseas) status was part of the delicate balance and negotiations conducted and concluded at the time of the joint declaration.",3
"As my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary made clear in the other place towards the end of last year, we are not at this stage seeking to alter any one part of the package, including the consular status of British nationals (overseas) The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, asked about the 64 members of the Hong Kong police who have the right of abode in the UK.",3
It sets out that immigration decisions are the sole responsibility of the Hong Kong special administrative region.,3
"There is, of course, a marked disparity between the speed with which this review has been published and the lack of speed with which the report on—for example —Russian interference in elections has appeared, a marked disparity for which there is no obvious explanation We cannot overstate how damning this review has been of the Government’s “institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race” The way in which individuals and families were wrongly deported and deprived of their livelihoods caused enormous suffering.",3
"Can the Government say how they will ensure that further victims receive the compensation they deserve, and receive it speedily On the wider issue of the hostile environment, can the Government today mark a change in direction and agree to put an end to this policy, beginning by ending deportation flights for foreign national offenders who have lived here since childhood, committing that the historic case review will include those who have committed offences, and keeping open the compensation scheme for as long as necessary One of the more damning lines of the report was that the scandal was “foreseeable and avoidable”.",3
"Even the executive summary of the report—I am sure that the Minister will not be entirely surprised if I say that I have not read all 275 pages of it—says that “the Home Office … must change its culture to recognise that migration and wider Home Office policy is about people and, whatever its objective, should be rooted in humanity.” It is a fairly damning statement on the present state of affairs for that to appear as a part of this review We do not want similar issues arising over citizenship rights in the light of our withdrawal from the EU, and neither will a future immigration policy based on devaluing the value and skills of many people help the situation, particularly when some of those so-called low-skilled and insufficiently paid personnel are now deemed to be vital key workers in the present crisis when it comes to continuing school provision for their children I hope that the Government will take very seriously the recommendations in this report and the three elements into which they have been broken down in the last paragraph of the executive summary.",3
"It has cross-party support, and in due course I shall seek the opinion of the House on its merits The new clause aims to ensure that rights under UK law to family reunion, at present covered by Dublin III, will continue after the transition period, and that unaccompanied child refugees in Europe have a legal route to sanctuary in the UK.",3
Our attitude to child refugees will help to define the sort of country that we are.,3
"That is the focus of this amendment, although I am sure that her conclusions will differ from mine Child refugees are the most vulnerable of all refugees.",3
One of our concerns must be to tackle trafficking and give child refugees legal routes to safety.,3
"Despite all the arguments that are going on, I believe that if the arguments regarding child refugees were put to the British people, they would still basically be supported—not unanimously, of course, but I believe that there is a broad measure of public support for us being humanitarian and supporting child refugees I will develop some of these points.",3
Family reunion under Dublin III is currently the only legal pathway to reach the UK from the EU for the purposes of claiming asylum.,4
"It will no longer apply after the transition period, so child refugees have only two and a half months to access a safe alternative to a lorry or a dinghy for crossing It is true that Her Majesty’s Government has a draft proposal for family reunion, but I contend that it is inadequate.",3
"However, in contrast to the vagueness and imprecision regarding their approach to family reunion, the Government have proposed very firm measures indeed to return failed asylum seekers, and there is a real contrast between what we do to remove people and what we do to accept people who have a legitimate right to seek asylum here Given the deficiency in the Government’s proposal, this amendment gives Parliament a chance to ensure the basic principle of family reunion.",3
"Last year, some 3,000 unaccompanied children claimed asylum in the UK.",3
Most of them came illegally.,3
"In 2020, some 12,000 unaccompanied children have been granted asylum in this country, but more than 10,000 came via dangerous and illegal routes.",3
"Contrast that with Germany, which took 35% of child asylum claims; indeed, according to the UNHCR, it took 71,000 children in 2019.",3
"I have mentioned a few of them already but I will mention some of the others: Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Croatia, Finland, Germany—which I have mentioned—Ireland, Portugal, Luxembourg, Lithuania and Slovenia have all committed to welcoming unaccompanied child refugees.",4
"That is the proper way forward I turn to Section 67, the provision that enables unaccompanied child refugees who do not have family here to come here.",3
"A week or so ago, 21 council leaders urged the Prime Minister to support legal protection for refugees.",3
That means that we will encourage trafficking because we will be blocking a legal route.,3
"It is right that local authorities should be asked to play a part in the national transfer scheme but it is also right that local authorities play a part in taking children from northern France, the Greek islands and elsewhere Some time ago, 25 councils pledged more than 1,400 places for child refugees in Europe if the Government provided a safe and legal route for these children to come.",3
"In the last sentence of her letter, she said: “We stand ready to play our part again and urge you to take a humane and welcoming approach to the resettlement of these refugees on the Aegean Islands.” We have commitments from a number of councils.",3
"Support for child refugees—and the willingness to support them—comes from councillors of different political complexions, including Conservative ones.",3
"Councils prefer children to come via the legal route, of course, because then arrangements can be planned, the proper provisions can be made and it is not done in haste, as Kent must do if a dinghy arrives; it means that it can be done properly, which makes much more sense for local authorities We know that local councils have faced enormous financial pressures over the years—particularly recently—but as long as they are funded and supported adequately by central government, they are willing to welcome refugee children from Europe.",3
"My Lords, unless action is taken now, the arrival of 2021 will see child refugees in Europe lose safe and legal routes to the UK since neither a right to family reunion nor access to the Dubs scheme, under which lone children had a legal route to sanctuary in the UK, will then be available.",3
Family reunion under Dublin III regulations is currently the only available legal pathway to reach the UK from the EU for the purposes of claiming asylum.,4
"As my noble friend Lord Dubs said, the figures also suggest that the numbers involved under a mandatory requirement are very small, certainly compared with the hundreds of thousands of people whom this Government, without any free movement requirement to do so, do not have any issues with freely allowing to come to this country each year from outside the EU As my noble friend Lady Lister of Burtersett said, research has shown that of the 12,000 unaccompanied children granted asylum by the UK over the past decade, some 10,000 came to the UK by dangerous routes on lorries and small boats, probably via people smugglers, because they could not access a legal route.",3
"My Lords, I had not originally intended to return to the question of children’s right to citizenship on Report, as I had simply wanted to register our continuing concern in the context of this Bill, which will mean that many more children stand to be affected in future, adding a new urgency to the issue.",3
"Once again, I thank the Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens, of which I am a patron, and Amnesty International UK, for their help with the amendment and the work they do Colleagues pursuing this issue have now taken the name of “Terriers United”—united in our determination to achieve justice for a group of children in vulnerable circumstances: a group of children born in this country or who have spent most of their lives here and who have the right to British citizenship under the British Nationality Act 1981, but who have to register that right because of their parents’ immigration status.",3
"I shall not go into all the details, as noble Lords can read them; nor do I expect the Minister to do so—she might be relieved to hear—but it covers all the issues addressed in Committee: the role of local authorities, particularly with regard to looked-after children; awareness and information, with reference to which I ask whether the Minister is able to report back to us yet on her welcome commitment in Committee to raise with the Home Secretary our calls to raise awareness of citizenship; and, of course, the level of the fee, which was our main focus The amendment also covers other barriers such as the “good character” test, a discretionary test which can be used to prevent children aged 10 and over registering their right to citizenship even where they have had minimal contact with the criminal justice system, such as receiving a caution.",3
"Again without going into detail, I note that proposed new subsection (3)(a), which covers those with protected characteristics under the Equality Act, would include Roma children, who, according to the European Children’s Rights Unit, are more likely than other EU children in this country to be entitled to British citizenship and to be economically disadvantaged I am aware that the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration published a report on fees last year, but this ranged much more widely and did not cover other barriers to citizenship registration.",3
"That said, the inspector raised a number of concerns about children’s citizenship fees, reflecting the volume of evidence received from stakeholders.",3
"It was premised on the importance of citizenship to belonging, security, identity, inclusion and integration.",3
"The judgment underlined why citizenship is important and how the inability of many children to exercise their right to register as citizens because of the fee causes many children born in the UK to “feel alienated, excluded, isolated, second best, insecure and not fully assimilated into the culture and social fabric of the UK” It is a matter of regret that the Home Office is appealing that judgment, to be heard next week.",3
"I have two responses to that: first, a right conferred by Parliament to ensure that children and young people connected to the UK should have the security of citizenship should not be undermined in the interests of the wider finances of the overall BICS; and, secondly, in conflating the cost of registering citizenship with that of the costs of the borders and immigration system, and at an aggregate level, the Minister evaded the key question of the mark-up for citizenship registration at the level of the individual.",3
She glossed over how that money is being used to cross-subsidise borders and immigration operations that have nothing to do with citizenship registration.,3
"In doing so, the Home Office is once more committing the fundamental category error of treating the right to British citizenship as being part of the immigration system.",3
It is this category error that lies at the heart of why so many British young people continue to grow up effectively excluded from the citizenship that is theirs by right under the British Nationality Act The third plank rests on another category error—that leave to remain represents the equivalence of citizenship.,3
"So while it was welcome that the Minister did not try to argue that citizenship is not important, it was in fact implicit in her response to the attempt to exempt looked-after children from the registration fee.",3
Access to limited and indefinite leave to remain is no substitute for the security of citizenship.,3
"Deployment of resources in respect of non-criminal incidents, whether involving hate or fraud, should be treated as non-core activities Another area of criminal impunity is in relation to illegal immigrants.",3
"Best estimates are that there are more than 1 million illegal immigrants in the United Kingdom, many of whom are engaged in illegal working and other clandestine criminal activities.",4
"The number of deportations is also pitifully few The scope of this Bill, however, goes far beyond fraud and illegal immigration.",3
"This ineffectual regulation is driving good private landlords out of the market without deterring or penalising the rogues Many colleagues will be aware of constituents’ anger due to double standards relating to illegal activities by Gypsies and Travellers compared with the actions of law-abiding residents, as well as due to local authorities’ failure to enforce trading standards laws against the rogue operators of park home sites.",3
"In the last month alone, I have received complaints from constituents about the police’s failure to pursue a blatant case of threatened unlawful eviction, their refusal to act against the dealers of illegal drugs, and their failure to enforce the Highways Act 1980 against a pavement obstruction.",3
"Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Catherine West) set out her views on a foreign policy underpinned by security, trade and human rights and the risks of our leaving some of the security arrangements within the EU.",3
"Will we stand alongside people across the globe who are fighting for a more just world, to end global poverty, inequality, conflict and climate catastrophe In recent years, I am afraid that this Government have too often put this country on the wrong side of that divide, selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, building friendships with controversial nationalists such as Viktor Orbán, conducting trade talks with the US to sell off our NHS, funding the fossil fuel industry overseas through export finance and UK aid, and failing to condemn President Trump’s dangerous foreign policy decisions—instead inviting him for state visits, with little to say about his Muslim ban, detaining child migrants, threats of nuclear Armageddon, and military interventionism by tweet.",3
"Let us remember that it is this US President who turned his back on the Kurds after they fought ISIS in Syria; cut United Nations Relief and Works Agency funding, which supports 5.5 million Palestinian refugees; and is withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement.",3
"Those concerned with the fight against global poverty have spent too much precious time trying to get a simple answer to a simple question, so let me ask it: are this Government committed to an independent Department for International Development with its own Secretary of State and maintaining the UK’s 0.7% commitment on overseas aid?",3
"In the Queen’s Speech, we heard about plans to carry out an integrated security, defence and foreign policy review, which will “reassess the nation’s place in the world, covering....defence to diplomacy and development.” Can the Minister enlighten us as to when this review will happen, and crucially, will he assure us that a broad range of stakeholders will be involved in the review, including civil society organisations in the UK and those overseas who are impacted by the UK’s international policies The UK will host COP26 in Glasgow later this year.",3
"She was a hard-working constituency MP, who supported many constituents with immigration cases and prevented deportations, and she was a long-serving member of the Transport Committee.",3
"I grew up in an ordinary working-class family, the granddaughter of immigrants from West Africa and Dublin.",3
"Some victims were subject to immigration enforcement, including the serious trauma of immigration detention.",3
Some were removed or deported.,3
"The Department was warned via inspectorate reports, by the 2014 “Chasing Status” report by the Legal Action Group, by high commissioners, by analysis of the right to rent carried out by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, and by others.",3
"The Department had a duty of care to ensure that people’s rights and entitlements were recognised...We do not consider that the Department adequately considered that duty in the way that it introduced immigration policy.” In short, it seems that all the warning signs were ignored or deemed acceptable collateral damage.",3
"In the light of the history, I think it has already been accepted that there is little doubt that Windrush victims will have no trust in the immigration and nationality system or in the Home Office.",3
Many are poor or not well off; hence there was no need for passports for foreign trips.,3
"The application form declares that the Home Office does not think that people will need an immigration lawyer to complete it, yet question 1 alone asks about lapsed status, settled status, whether people were ordinarily resident, and the right of abode.",3
"Ministers do have discretion, but I suppose that I am going even further than that: this should not be discretionary, because somebody either is and was a British citizen when they came, and therefore their descendants were, and their right to be here, to remain and to have citizenship is outwith any discretionary decision about their good character, their moral conduct or whether they have a conviction.",4
"The same principle needs to apply: if somebody’s parents were British citizens when they arrived here in 1969 or 1970, with their British passport that they came over with from Jamaica, their children are also British citizens regardless.",4
"It is all very well to paint people as terrible criminals, which is why they have to be deported, but that still gets the moral argument wrong because they are British citizens—[Interruption.]",3
"If they are a descendant of a member of the Windrush generation, or are themselves a member, they had a right to British citizenship from the day that they were born and therefore, they are British citizens.",4
The Government are applying retrospectively their moral judgments on that to try to appease some test of being tough on deportations and foreign criminals.,3
"Until then, he and I will continue to argue about whether the deportations are necessary.",3
"Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell), who made some very important points I welcome the Bill and the Government’s recognition that the Windrush compensation scheme is a critical step in rectifying mistakes made and the losses faced by individuals wrongly deported from their own country.",3
"I do not have many ethnic minorities on the Isle of Wight, but this is about humanity and the rule of law, and therefore I make no apology for speaking in this debate The negative impacts suffered by members of the Windrush generation resulted from their being unable to demonstrate their lawful immigration status.",3
"There is a darker implication, however, in that the approach to investigations has involved the systematic targeting of specific groups combined with a failure to handle immigration law with integrity.",3
"As someone who is partially an immigrant to this country myself, I am all for having a strict immigration system, but it needs to be fair and, as my hon.",2
"Even if that is happening in only a handful of cases, it is a handful too many One purpose of the Bill is to restore confidence in our immigration system, and I hope it does, but cases are still being reported of British families being divided.",3
"I would welcome Ministers’ comments on what can be done proactively to help citizens while they are in the UK, rather than their having to wait until they face deportation or are being deported before they can start to fight their case.",3
I understand that people are still receiving eviction letters and being booked on to deportation flights.,3
"To my mind, the ways in which this Conservative Government have treated the immigrants of the Windrush generation are among the most scandalous actions ever undertaken by the British state.",2
"Thousands of people have been denied their lawful right to housing, employment and healthcare by a Government who prioritise their political rhetoric on immigration over the safety and welfare of their citizens.",3
"Elderly people were deported—forced to leave the country where there had been educated, worked to raise their families and hoped to retire peacefully, living off the benefits to which they had spent a life- time contributing—for no better reason than that they had spent a short part of their childhood in a different country.",3
"There is no doubt that the Home Office hoped to meet its deportation targets, set by its political masters, by targeting a highly vulnerable group, and let us be absolutely clear about why this group were targeted.",3
There is no evidence that the Government have changed their fundamental attitude or approach towards deportations.,3
They continue to deprive lawful citizens of their rights and their citizenship.,2
"We continue to hear the same political rhetoric from the Conservative Government that led to these shameful deportations, and there is no let-up in the other manifestations of the hostile environment policies.",3
"That is what they were being told when they were denied healthcare, when they were denied jobs, when they were forced on to the streets and when they were detained and deported The pervasive apparatus of the hostile environment sent one message, that these British citizens did not really belong.",3
"It was the result of long-entrenched ideas that scapegoat minorities and migrants, and it goes back decades While the Windrush generation was busy rebuilding the country, the likes of Enoch Powell were blaming migrants for the country’s faltering economy.",3
"It was Thatcher who changed the law to stop people who were born in the UK automatically acquiring citizenship, a change that led to some children of the Windrush generation being denied their rights.",3
"Ever since, leading politicians have continued to scapegoat: blaming falling wages on migrants, not on greedy bosses; blaming growing housing waiting lists on asylum seekers, not on the sell-off of council homes; blaming overcrowded classrooms on refugees, not on the Government who slashed education funding; and blaming violent crime on “black culture,” not on decades of state neglect Those attacks—that scapegoating—were so successful that the last Prime Minister boasted about creating a hostile environment and spoke with pride as she sent “go home” vans around London boroughs.",3
"Every step of the way, the Government have dragged their feet: the compensation scheme has only given out payments to 3% of claimants; the lessons learned review has still not been published; and charter flights are still deporting people, even before the review is published, even before its recommendations are implemented, and even before it has been established that none of those waiting to be deported has a Windrush claim.",3
"It will pave the way for the ending of freedom of movement for EU citizens and the introduction of a single, fairer points-based immigration system which treats people in the same way, regardless of their nationality It is now over four years since the British people voted in a referendum to leave the European Union.",3
"I know that not all noble Lords were happy with that result, but it was the clearly and democratically expressed will of the people of the United Kingdom, and I do not think that anyone can doubt that concerns about immigration played a part in the referendum.",3
"It does that by repealing EU immigration legislation that is retained by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020.",3
"By ending free movement, EEA citizens, including both EU citizens and those from EFTA countries, and their family members will become subject to UK immigration law and will require the same permission to enter and remain in this country as people from the rest of the world.",3
"This will pave the way for the introduction of our new points-based immigration system from 1 January 2021, as we pledged to do in the general election manifesto that my party put before the people last December.",3
"There will remain limited exceptions to this, as is the case now; namely, where an Irish citizen is subject to deportation orders, exclusion decisions or an international travel ban The wider rights enjoyed by Irish citizens in the UK that flow from the common travel area arrangements remain, as reaffirmed in the memorandum of understanding signed by the UK and Ireland last year.",3
"It could include arrangements that provide healthcare cover for tourists, short-term business visitors and service providers; arrangements that allow workers to rely on contributions made in two or more countries to access their state pension, including uprating; and arrangements that prevent dual social security contribution liabilities As I have indicated, once free movement ends, we will introduce a single immigration system that encompasses citizens of the whole world.",3
We do not believe that any part of this nation would be well served by operating different immigration systems in different regions.,2
Prospective migrants will be able to score additional points if they have particular skills or based on the nature of the job they are coming to do.,3
"This will ensure that it really is an immigration system that enables us to attract the very best migrants from around the world We are seizing the opportunity to change the entire system for the better, with simpler, clear and transparent routes.",3
This is in addition to extensive stakeholder events held in 2019 Our engagement has focused on those sectors most impacted and those who have previously had little interaction with the immigration system due to reliance on EU labour.,3
"We recently announced the introduction of the health and care visa from this summer, which will offer fast-tracked entry to the UK for eligible health and care professionals, reduced application fees and dedicated support through the application process.",3
"Those eligible will also be exempt from paying the immigration health surcharge In addition to this new visa, we have introduced a number of unprecedented measures to support health workers from overseas.",3
"These include: supporting NHS workers with a free, automatic one-year visa extension for those with six months or less left to stay on their visas; exempting all NHS workers, wider health professionals and social care workers from the requirement to pay the health surcharge; and, as we have clarified, refunding payments made since 31 March.",3
"DHSC is also providing councils with access to an additional £1.5 billion for adults’ and children’s social care in 2020-21 As the MAC identified in its own report, published earlier this year, the immigration system is not the sole solution to the employment issues in the social care sector.",3
It would be a very poor reward for all of those who have worked heroically in the care sector if we were to set up an immigration route which had the effect of keeping wages in the sector at or near minimum wage—a point that the chairman of the MAC has made.,3
"As we implement the new immigration system, we want employers to focus on investing in our domestic workforce.",3
"This includes a widespread focus on training, increasing the prestige of our domestic workforce, and introducing a proper career structure to provide opportunities for those in the sector while making it an attractive profession for prospective carers In conclusion, there are many across this House who care passionately about immigration issues.",3
"It enables the Government to deliver an immigration system that is firm, fair and fit for the future, supporting economic recovery and prioritising jobs for people here in the UK, while continuing to attract the brightest and the best global talent.",3
"EEA nationals will become subject to United Kingdom immigration laws after the Brexit transition period, and thus be covered by the Government’s points-based immigration system, to be introduced next year.",3
"Progress in the Lords will not be so rapid as in the Commons, although it remains to be seen whether that will be due solely to the August Recess The Bill does not itself create a new immigration system.",3
"However, the Bill gives Henry VIII powers to the Government which are so wide-ranging in the way they are worded that they would enable the Government to modify, by unamendable statutory instrument, both primary immigration legislation and retained direct EU legislation.",3
"The Government maintain that the Henry VIII powers in Clause 4 are only to address necessary technical legislative changes to primary legislation, arising from the ending of free movement The same powers in Clause 5, say the Government, are there to enable, first, consequential modifications to be made to primary legislation and other retained EU law if areas of the retained EU social security co-ordination regulations, co-ordinating access to social security for individuals moving between EEA states, have to be repealed because they are not covered in a reciprocal agreement with the EU following the end of the transition period; and, secondly, if consequential technical amendments are needed to legislation arising from any new reciprocal agreement with the EU The Lords Delegated Powers Committee said of the previous Bill, however, that Clause 4 presents “a very significant delegation of power from Parliament to the Executive”, and on Clause 5 it said that “Parliament is being asked to scrutinise a clause so lacking in any substance whatsoever that it cannot even be described as a skeleton.” Parliament is going to be denied any proper say and involvement in determining even the basic principles of our future immigration policy post Brexit, and the ending of free movement.",3
"Yet the Government admit in their fact sheet 3 on the Bill that: “By ending free movement, the Bill makes a substantial change to the UK’s immigration laws.” This is not about the merits or otherwise of Brexit; that decision has been made.",3
"It is about the Government’s attitude towards Parliament and its major law-making process in scrutinising and then deciding which Government legislative proposals should, or should not, be passed, rejected or amended While the Bill seeks to deny an opportunity to address issues of concern about our immigration system, that does not mean they were not raised in the Commons and will not be raised in the Lords.",3
"Issues that have had cross-party support include a time limit on immigration detention for the purpose of deportation, the granting of automatic indefinite leave to remain to eligible EEA and Swiss national children who are in care, or are care leavers, and the need for the continuation of the existing EU arrangements on unaccompanied child refugees and family reunification Further issues include, but are not confined to: the application of the “no recourse to public funds” rules, in the light of an apparent promise of a review made by the Prime Minister on 27 May; the progress being made on the Government’s commitment to abolish the immigration health charge for all migrants working in the NHS and social care; exemption from the immigration skills charge for NHS employers in the light of the reality that some hospitals are now paying nearly £1 million a year; clarity on the rights and status of EU nationals in the UK following the end of the transition period, including proof of settled status; and limitations on the duration of the Henry VIII powers The end of free movement and the move to the points-based immigration system, with its general salary threshold of £25,600 per annum for coming to work in the UK, seeks to equate low pay with low skills and low value.",3
"This sends a clear negative message that, in today’s sometimes distorted view of the value of different jobs to society, we do not appreciate the contribution they make and the skills they bring In the Commons last week, a Home Office Minister said that the reason that care workers had been excluded from the qualifying list for the health and care visa was because the Government had a “vision” for the social care sector that it should no longer carry on looking abroad to recruit at or near the minimum wage, and that the Government’s priority was that, in future, care sector jobs will be “valued, rewarded and trained for, and that immigration should not be an alternative.”—[Official Report, Commons, 13/7/20; col. 1250] If that means significantly better rates of pay in the underpaid social care sector, I am sure it will have widespread support.",3
"However, yesterday the Government said that with the vast majority of social care workers employed in the private sector their “ability to influence pay rates there is limited” Since there are already 100,000 vacancies in England’s care sector alone, and the current flow of people from abroad to fill low-paid care sector jobs is about to dry up, how have the Government been able to satisfy themselves not only that UK-based workers will immediately step in to fill that gap but that they can lower vacancy levels in the social care sector If higher pay rates materialise in the social care sector, as a result of the points-based immigration system, there will presumably be an increase in the cost of providing social care.",3
Perhaps the Government could provide an answer to that question in their response at the end of this debate The Government have said that ending free movement from the EU plus the future points-based immigration system should reduce net migration.,3
"We understand where we are with Brexit, but we deplore so much of UK immigration policy, we do not support the Bill and we deeply regret the loss of free movement and our membership of what we regarded as a union which was more than political Ironically, in the context, the Bill denies parliamentary sovereignty.",3
"In its report on the same Bill in a previous Parliament, our Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, to which the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, referred, made that quite clear The Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, which lives its name, lists the issues of the Bill: legal uncertainty; lack of detail; the power of the Secretary of State to remove unspecified rights; the power to thwart the will of Parliament; the power to amend Acts of Parliament and secondary legislation, which there is an awful lot of; the power to set immigration fees, the size of which can restrict the exercise of rights; diminishing scrutiny; and no clarity on how changes in relation to Irish citizens will affect the rights of Northern Irish citizens under the Good Friday agreement Preliminary research by the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association has identified three important legal protections which are not in any way addressed in the Bill.",3
"These are: protections for victims of trafficking in the anti-trafficking directive; protections for asylum seekers in the receptions conditions directive; and protections for victims of crime in the victims’ rights directive Our immigration law is, in the words of the Law Commission, “overly complex and unworkable”.",3
"Ask anyone faced with the need for a spouse visa, who becomes part of a Skype family.",4
"I hope that I have not contributed to my noble friend Lady Ludford’s ill health by suggesting that she deals with Clause 5 It is not beyond the bounds of the possible that, as values diverge, asylum may be sought in the UK from countries where discrimination becomes persecution—I am thinking of Hungary and Poland—so it is entirely right that, in an EU Bill, we address whether, how and for how long we use detention in immigration removal centres.",3
"We will have more time to debate that in Committee, as we will have more time to discuss family reunion for refugees and ensuring safe and legal routes for unaccompanied children—something that member states have mandated the EU to deal with, so there are no bilateral agreements there; all that is on the table is a very inadequate draft text from the UK The immigration system is much more than the points-based system, but the PBS is currently in the spotlight.",3
"It is to be preceded by the health and social care visa and a belated nod to the health charge levied on health workers who pay tax, but hands-on “care workers won’t be able to apply for a visa dedicated to care.” That neat summary comes courtesy of the BBC’s Dominic Casciani.",3
The link is the lack of provision for migrant women suffering abuse Let one sector in the PBS stand proxy for many.,3
Immigration and asylum issues are fairly emotive.,2
"Despite the nature and effect of various pieces of immigration and asylum legislation, the circumstances surrounding them remain contentious.",3
The present immigration and social security co-ordination Bill is a clear example of the failure of the Government’s strategy to make migration work for Britain.,3
"All the promises about controlling numbers—fewer than 100,000 a year—have not worked for Britain Economic migrants have helped to make Britain one of the richer countries in the world, both economically and culturally.",3
"There remains a positive economic benefit from managed immigration, filling the demand for skills and labour that are in short supply.",3
"There is a very high error rate in the initial decision-making process, which results in a culture of rejection We have seen race and immigration issues being exploited during both general and local elections.",3
The attempts by politicians to appease a certain section of the public and the media shamefully made a political football of the immigration issue.,3
We were told that millions of Turkish migrants were ready to enter this country after the referendum.,3
One does not need Home Office vans touring the streets of London telling illegal immigrants to go home: this is not the way to run our country Immigration policies have played a crucial role in successive Governments over the past few years.,3
"The Labour Government in the 1950s, at the time of Windrush, set up an interdepartmental committee to consider the possibility of legislation and administrative methods to deal with the matter of immigrants.",3
"We are refusing to give proper documentation to settled migrants from the EU, despite the concern expressed on this by EU ambassadors and others Finally, there are many issues in the present legislation that we intend to probe; many of them have been highlighted by other speakers.",3
Key among these is that the Bill leaves the immigration system to secondary legislation.,3
"We need to give more consideration to the care sector’s value and to work to keep its workforce; otherwise they will continue to be an afterthought in immigration, as well as other areas.",3
"As others have said, part of the new points-based immigration system disadvantages them.",3
They will be excluded from the new health and care visa.,3
"As a Scots Peer, I think that immigration must remain principally a UK-wide competence, as the noble Lord, Lord Morrow, said.",3
I strongly disagree with the SNP’s proposal for an alternative immigration system for Scotland.,3
Scotland’s immigration needs are not significantly different from other parts of the United Kingdom.,3
"Anyway, how could we prevent immigrants moving around the UK without border controls?",3
The Deputy Speaker will know and I am sure that he would agree that the last thing we need are border controls at Gretna and Berwick.,3
The dénouement came when his citizenship ceremony took place.,3
"Other new migrants had been given crib cards showing the words of the national anthem, but they were unable to sing it when the audio system broke down in the town hall in the middle of their rendering of “God Save the Queen”.",3
"However, the number of EU migrants who have applied to stay after Brexit already exceeds the official estimate.",3
"When the deadline for applications comes on 30 June 2021, there are likely to be people who will lose their legal status overnight and face wrongful deportation.",3
"That further opportunity is bound not to be taken up if people do not know about it In Committee, I will press for an improvement in the granting of visa for the tech industry.",3
"Half of the UK’s fastest growing companies have at least one foreign-born co-founder, according to studies.",3
"My Lords, I want to talk about unaccompanied migrant children.",3
"On the basis of that declaration, the Commission was given a negotiation mandate, but there is no mention in it of asylum, refugees or unaccompanied children.",3
"We need to amend this immigration Bill to ensure that, in taking back control, as the Government say repeatedly, unaccompanied children are not forgotten.",3
"Without safe legal routes to sanctuary, they will be easy prey for trafficking and smuggling gangs The Government’s position is to weaken these children’s rights.",3
"Therefore, it is only right that we design and shift to a system which is sovereign and based on skills—that is what this country needs I hope that, as we make this transition over the coming 12 months or so, we send a message to the world that we are still open to migrants and that we are not closing the shop or raising the drawbridge.",3
"In fact, I hope we can see migrants—such as me and my own family, who came here from Hong Kong in my father’s generation—as people who want to come and contribute to Britain, be a bridge to the rest of the world once they are here and be part of helping to level up the country, which I know is a government priority I will not dwell on the Henry VIII clauses, because it is important that the Government have the flexibility they need over the coming months.",3
"However, it is important that Parliament is involved in this process and in the evolution of our immigration system, and that the Government do not create policy on the fly, which there is a risk of given the scope of the powers the Bill might give I have a couple of questions for the Minister.",3
"For example, areas that are already wealthy may get some of the more skilled, talented and wealthier migrants, whereas there are parts of the country which really need an influx of talent from overseas.",3
"Do the Government have plans, particularly around free ports, that are envisaged to encourage that kind of shift Secondly, I am worried about capacity: what preparations have been made in the Home Office and the Border Force to cope with the change and the demand that may come?",3
"Is reform coming to the Home Office to enable it to handle this demand, given that is has such a backlog of regular passports to process currently Could we one day shift to a system where we can match the demand from different industries in closer to real time?",3
"There is such a delay between knowing where the skills are needed and whether you can match them through local skills coming through the pipeline, or if you need to import labour from overseas.",3
"My Lords, I start, as did the noble Lord, Lord Purvis of Tweed, by paying tribute to all the immigrants who have come to our country and worked in essential services and elsewhere.",3
"That is a tragedy and, working with colleagues across the House, I will work to improve the Bill and send it back to the other place in a better state than it arrived in here As we have heard, the Bill repeals retained EU law on free movement and brings nations which benefited from that status into a single immigration system.",3
We need to look carefully at the powers of the Secretary of State to make immigration policy by way of the Immigration Rules.,3
"We must improve the position of workers coming from abroad to work in the health and social care sectors—they are vital to the proper functioning of our society and to ensure that people are looked after properly in old age and when they are ill—along with an affordable, simple, effective and clear route to residency and citizenship if they want to take that The Minister referred to the long-term plan for social care in her opening remarks.",3
"The real risk, of course, is that people do not realise they need to take advantage of this scheme and potentially end up in our country illegally.",2
"The Government have a responsibility to ensure that these children’s immigration status is resolved properly and that the path to residency and citizenship is mapped out for them The noble Lord, Lord Balfe, asked me about our attitude to voting on Bills in this House.",3
The links between our two countries are to be treasured A number of noble Lords raised the issue of immigration detention.,3
"That demonstrates to me the importance attached to many immigration issues, and rightly so.",2
"I guess that there is a further irony, in that a first-generation Irish immigrant Front-Bencher is winding up the debate with a second-generation Irish immigrant; such is the importance that we attach to Irish immigrants My noble friends Lord Hodgson and Lord Lilley reflected on the trends of the last couple of decades—which are very important in the context of immigration —and the consequences that immigration has had for those trends, whether they be in housing or infrastructure or indeed in attitudes among society.",3
"In fact, the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, outlined—quite openly, I thought—the problems and consequences of immigration in the early 2000s Many noble Lords expressed concern about the detailed policies proposed under the points-based immigration system and the immigration delegated power set out in the Bill.",3
"It is a short, technical Bill that does just that and it does not deal with wider immigration issues I must also make it clear that the delegated power in the Bill will not be used to make wide-ranging policy reforms; it will merely switch off the free movement rights that EU citizens currently enjoy so that we can align the immigration treatment for EU and non-EU citizens.",3
"The Immigration Rules will continue to be used to set out the detailed requirements that a person must meet in order to live, work and study in the UK under the new points-based immigration system The Immigration Rules are well established and their use is based on the powers in the Immigration Act 1971.",3
"The Immigration Rules are subject to parliamentary scrutiny and enable flexibility, so that policies can be adapted to respond to changing circumstances—for example, as we have done during the coronavirus pandemic The Bill does not legislate on the details of the points-based system, nor does it legislate on detention, asylum or compliant environment policies.",3
"They should be valued more than they are The Home Secretary has introduced a free one-year automatic visa extension to approximately 3,000 key front-line health workers, including an exemption to the immigration health surcharge.",3
"The Home Secretary has also expanded the bereavement scheme to all NHS health and social care workers to include offering indefinite leave to remain for immediate family members and bereaved hospital support workers and social care workers On 29 April, we announced that we will extend the visas of NHS front-line workers and their families whose visas expire between 31 March and 1 October.",3
The extension to NHS visas will be automatic.,3
There will be no fee attached and it will be exempt from the immigration health surcharge.,3
"Social care workers who are employed by NHS trusts, or independent health and care providers, and working in one of the defined occupations, will benefit from the automatic visa extensions offer where visas are due to expire between 31 March and 1 October 2020 There has been much discussion about the ability of migrant workers to undercut UK workers.",3
"However, there is a challenge to employers across this country around the easy option of migrant labour, which has undercut our own home-grown workforce for far too long.",3
That is a challenge for employers in this country I come next to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and family reunion.,2
I have said it before and I will say it again: the UK has a long and proud tradition of providing safety to those who claim asylum and it will not be affected by our exit from the EU.,4
"During the transition period, the UK will continue to reunite unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in Europe with family members in the UK under the Dublin regulation.",3
We will continue to process all those transfer requests We have now presented a genuine and sincere offer to the EU on a new reciprocal arrangement for the family reunion of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.,3
"Additionally, children with immediate family members in the UK will still be able to join them under the refugee family reunion rules and part 8 and appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.",3
"Across government, we are working to ensure that all eligible children obtain the UK immigration status they are due.",3
We will not establish different visa arrangements for different nations or regions of the UK.,3
"The MAC has repeatedly said that the economic situations in different parts of the UK are not sufficiently different to warrant different immigration arrangements The noble Baroness, Lady Ritchie of Downpatrick, referred to Northern Irish citizens and the Good Friday agreement.",3
"A person of Northern Ireland, as defined in the Belfast agreement, has the right to hold British and Irish citizenship, and the right to identify as British, Irish or both, as they may so choose.",4
"On the face of it they seem high, particularly when we are talking about children, but application fees for border, immigration and citizenship services play a vital role in our ability to run a sustainable system.",3
"The income helps to deliver the funding requirements to run the border, immigration and citizenship service and substantially reduces the burden on UK taxpayers.",3
"Modern slavery and human trafficking have no place in this society, and we are committed to fortifying our immigration system against these crimes while ensuring that victims are protected and offenders prosecuted.",2
Decisions made through the national referral mechanism regarding whether someone is in fact a victim of modern slavery are not affected by their nationality or their immigration status.,3
The noble Lord asked about the creative industries and the noble Baroness asked about modern foreign language teachers.,3
"We greatly value the contribution that migrants make to faith communities in this country, and that is why there are two routes for religious workers within the current immigration system which will be continued under the future points-based system.",3
We do not agree that Home Office data on immigration is poor.,3
"It may be criticised, but we publish some of the most comprehensive immigration statistics of any country and their quality is overseen by the UK Statistics Authority which has been clear that the data is good.",3
"We are developing a broader immigration system that, going forward, will be digital by default.",3
"As I told the noble Lord on a previous occasion, individuals will receive notification of their immigration status by email or letter.",3
"Friend the Member for Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine) stated that, as a result of the work of the Scottish Affairs Committee, it was clear that the immigration needs of Scotland would be best met on a sectoral, rather than geographical, basis.",3
The Scottish Affairs Committee was told that the UK can vary visas for different areas and sectors under existing laws.,3
"I therefore urge the Government to use these powers in consultation with the Scottish Government Agriculture is a key sector in my constituency of North East Fife that relies on a migrant workforce throughout the year, particularly at peak harvest times.",3
"The need for visas for non-EEA nationals to crew fishing boats is acute in Cornwall, as it is in East Neuk and elsewhere in Scotland The Scottish Government’s migration report states: “The current UK immigration system is complex and consists of a number of different routes and visas for work and study in an unclear system of tiers alongside a restrictive approach to family migration.” I agree.",4
"After her travel visa expired, she should have been eligible for a family reunification visa, for she had no surviving spouse.",3
"She applied for the visa through a law firm based in Dundee, with the family making the assumption that it would be granted.",3
"Andriya sadly lost his job in 2015 but is now close to qualifying as a student teacher, thanks to Valentyna’s help But following errors in her initial application, and a failed appeal, Valentyna faces deportation back to Ukraine.",3
"Clearly, it is totally unacceptable to deport Valentyna, sending her somewhere where she has no family, has not lived for a decade, has no prospect of finding a job, and has her health put at risk.",3
"We are failing Valentyna and many others like her As a newly elected MP, it is incredibly worrying to see the clockwork regularity of constituents contacting my office because they or their family face deportation because their visas have not been processed or their settled status has not been granted.",3
"You do not have to be a Member of Parliament for long for it to be clear, if it was not already, that our immigration system is not working.",3
"We will look carefully at the recommendation of an immigration pilot for remote communities, and how that could potentially assist in this area.",3
"The best example is where I was on the day the Scottish Government produced their plans—at Glasgow University, talking specifically about the changes to tier 1 to create an uncapped global talent route that will allow universities to put together research teams based not on passports, but on the skills they need to deliver accredited projects.",3
I heard the excitement when they saw the opportunity for Scottish interests and Scottish stakeholders to be at the heart of designing the UK’s immigration policy in a way that assists them.,3
"SNP Members should ask themselves whether the failings in education that Nicola Sturgeon has presided over have anything to do with Scottish companies seeking talent from elsewhere, or whether any number of overseas medical professionals will deal with the issues in the Scottish health service.",3
"This Government will create an in-response-to-demand NHS visa system that makes it easy to recruit health workers, but again, that will not necessarily tackle the core issues of the failure of domestic policy set by the Scottish National party As pointed out in this debate, immigration has brought a vast wealth of experience, expertise and diversity to the United Kingdom, and we have heard some great examples in this debate of where that has taken place, but that cannot be used as a stopgap or to make up for the failings of nationalist policies elsewhere.",3
"Above all, those who choose to come and make their lives in the United Kingdom should be welcomed across all four nations, not used to stoke constitutional grievances or in an attempt to set up a border at Berwick The United Kingdom Government have looked at the proposals, which talk of settlement.",3
"The idea, for example, that Torbay’s economy is instantly comparable to London’s because it happens to be in England, or that the appropriate solution for the Scottish highlands would be to have the same visa as in Edinburgh, misses some of the key ways our economy works.",3
"Glasgow University’s Student Action for Refugees recently hosted the Museum Without A Home exhibition, displaying everyday objects in solidarity with migrants and refugees around the world.",3
"At the same time, it collected more than 600 signatures for the Families Together petition, calling for refugee children to have the right to be reunited with their parents in their home.",3
"A smaller number have signed the petition that I am now presenting in the House of Commons style, which makes the same demand The petition states: The petition of residents of Glasgow North, Declares that under current family reunion rules adult refugees can only sponsor their partners and children under 18 years old to join them in the UK; further that child refugees in the UK have no family reunion rights so they can’t bring their parents to join them; further that the lack of opportunities for refugees to reunite with family members forces people to turn to smugglers and exacerbates the humanitarian crises in Southern Europe; and further that, for refugees already living safely in the UK, the enforced separation from their families and constant anxiety about their wellbeing can be devastating, preventing them from rebuilding their lives and undermining their successful integration into their new communities.",3
"The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Government to expand the criteria of who qualifies as a family member for the purposes of refugee family reunion, including by allowing adult refugees in the UK to sponsor their adult children, their siblings that are under the age of 25, and their parents; further to give unaccompanied refugee children in the UK the right to sponsor their parents and siblings that are under the age of 25 to join them under the refugee family reunion rules; and further to reintroduce legal aid for refugee family reunion cases And the petitioners remain, etc [P002555]",3
"The Home Office continues to provide extensive support to local authorities, which have relevant statutory responsibilities for this cohort, to ensure that these children and young people, like other vulnerable groups, get UK immigration status under the EU settlement scheme.",3
"The central point of the Bill is a commitment to a global immigration system, and equal treatment of immigrants from all nationalities as we exit the transition period.",3
"We need an immigration system which encourages compliance but, where people refuse to leave voluntarily, we must have the ability to enforce that removal.",2
"Under these amendments, any person in scope who is detained for 28 days will automatically be released, regardless of the facts of their case, including some foreign national offenders who present a genuine threat to public safety The Home Office operates a number of safeguards to review detention and prevent anyone entering detention who would otherwise comply with a removal from the community.",3
"Where detention is deemed necessary, there is judicial oversight through bail applications to the tribunal, and the continuing detention of any individual remains under regular review by the Home Office Everyone in immigration detention is protected by these safeguards, which entitle them to apply for bail hearings at any point, to appeal against any refusal of asylum and to have access to legal representation.",3
"If we accept a 28-day time limit, it will enable these people to exploit the immigration system, making unmeritorious claims to avoid their removal.",3
"In the current immigration system, it is only in the most complex cases that detention exceeds 29 days.",3
"They have always been where I aim to be: on the side of the oppressed, not the oppressor, and always on the right side of history I am proud to be the daughter of Ghanaian migrants, and they are even prouder that myself and my hon.",3
Most immigrants.,2
"They are the same immigrants who are vilified as the Government enforce their hostile environment and the 3 million EU nationals, many of whom live in my constituency—another Windrush scandal in the making I recently discovered that after the slave trade, this country—our country, my country—took out a loan of the equivalent of £300 billion to pay off slave owners.",3
"For their troubles, some lost their homes and their jobs, were separated from their families, detained, deported and dehumanised, and are now being denied the dignity of a proper civil compensation scheme Let us not forget the people of Grenfell Tower: 72 people dead and many more traumatised by the loss of their loved ones and the loss of their homes, a community scarred for generations.",3
"We live in a world where, across the pond, there is a leader who cages migrant children.",3
"To our shame, our Government this month voted down refugee children’s rights.",3
I was energised as a student activist to stop the fascist BNP and to help stop the deportation of one of my fellow students.,3
So I am very proud to have been appointed shadow immigration Minister and continue that fight today.,3
We heard the figures earlier for the quota that is held: 29% of the UK fishing quota is owned or controlled by just five families; 49% of the English quota is held by companies based overseas; and the majority of UK fishing boats—79% of which are small-scale—hold only 20% of the UK quota.,3
One of the most shocking things that we discovered was that some of the boats and quotas were owned not just by foreigners but by non-active fishermen.,3
The committee was particularly concerned that the power under Clause 27 to distribute extra quota envisages fishing opportunities for British fishing boats that will take effect when the UK takes back control.,3
The original Bill’s Explanatory Notes say in that paragraph: “The scheme would only be used in relation to the portion of UK quota which may be allocated by the MMO or the Secretary of State to English fishing boats.,3
"My Lords, I want to draw attention to the difficulty that some children of migrant families brought up in the UK are facing, which has the potential to become another Windrush-style scandal.",3
Those over the age of 18 could face the threat of deportation.,3
"This is because they came to the UK as young children on their parents’ passport, and grew up and went to school here, but when they try to fulfil their dream of going to university, they realise they do not have the necessary papers They are not British citizens or refugees and do not have indefinite leave to remain, so before filling out their UCAS forms, they have to apply for limited leave to remain—an immigration status that allows them to legally stay in the UK for a period.",4
"I can give the noble Lord a general figure, which is that just over £2 billion was generated from visa, immigration and nationality income and passport fees in 2019-20.",3
"The cost of BICS, the borders, immigration and citizenship system, was £3.18 billion.",3
"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the United Kingdom’s new points-based immigration system Last week, I announced our plans for a radical new approach that works in the interests of the British people.",4
"It will be a fair, firm and fundamentally different system in the control of the British Government that prioritises those who come to our country based on the skills they have to offer, not on the country they come from, and it will enable the UK to become a magnet for the brightest and the best, with special immigration routes for those who will make the biggest contribution.",3
"We will create new arrangements for new migrants who will fill shortages in our NHS, build the companies and innovations of the future and benefit the UK for years to come As this Government restore our status as an independent sovereign nation, we will set our own immigration standards and controls as an open, democratic and free country.",3
"That includes ending free movement through the introduction of a single global immigration system that prioritises the skills that people have to offer, not where they come from, and restoring public trust in our immigration system with a system that truly works for this country.",3
"Our country and our people will prosper through one system and an approach that is in the control of the British Government—one that will also deliver an overall reduction in low-skilled immigration, as the public asked for Many of the values that define our great country originated in the huge benefits immigration has brought to our nation throughout its history.",3
"People from every corner of the globe have made an enormous contribution to the fabric of our society, which is why at the heart of this new single global immigration system will be a focus on attracting talented people from around the world and on the contribution they and their families will make, irrespective of their country of origin Last Wednesday, I published a policy statement setting out the new UK points-based immigration system, which will start operating from 1 January 2021 and will work in the interests of the whole United Kingdom.",3
"Additional points will be awarded for occupations that struggle to fill vacancies, and I am asking the Migration Advisory Committee to keep its list under regular review to ensure that it reflects the needs of the labour market The Government will ensure that talented employees from overseas on whom our great NHS relies can come here to work and provide high-quality, compassionate care.",3
"The new NHS visa system will provide a work visa with a fast-track decision, a larger dedicated advice service for applicants, and reduced fees Like many other Members, I represent a partly rural constituency.",3
"Let me also take this opportunity to reassure the House that the immigration arrangements for members of the armed forces, musicians and other performers are completely unchanged, and those routes will operate as they do now In line with the ending of free movement, there will be no immigration route for lower-skilled workers.",3
"Those changes are vital if we are to deliver a high-skill, high-wage and highly productive economy, and because we have provided certainty in respect of the new immigration system, the economy and businesses have had time to adjust.",3
The proposals set out in our policy statement are just the start of our phased approach to delivering a new immigration system.,3
"We will continue to refine our immigration system, and will build in flexibility where it is needed.",3
"Alongside the employer-led system, we will create a points-based unsponsored route to allow a limited number of the world’s most highly skilled people to come here without a job offer as part of the phased approach, if they can secure enough points Our new fair and firm immigration system will send a message to the whole world that Britain is open for business as we continue to attract the brightest and best from around the world, but with a system that the British Government have control over.",3
"Our new independence will strengthen border security, allowing us to reject insecure identity documents from newly arriving migrants.",3
I will shortly be bringing forward an immigration Bill and radically overhauling and simplifying the complex immigration rules that have really dominated the system over a number of decades.,3
"For the first time in decades, the UK will have control over who comes here and how our immigration system works.",3
"She and the Government call this a points-based immigration system, but Professor Alan Manning, the departing chair of the Migration Advisory Committee, has derided this and called it a “soundbite”—that is, meaningless phraseology.",3
"In trying to exclude their overseas recruitment, Ministers run the risk of doing even greater damage to our public services than they have done already Ministers must surely be aware that a key problem for the NHS is, as its leaders tell us, that the exit door is closed.",3
Blocking the overseas recruitment of social care workers who are generally paid well below the threshold will cause major problems with social care.,3
I must mention the need for the new NHS-specific visa.,3
"This is certainly not a singular global immigration system, and it has already been proved that a number of exemptions will be needed to make it work Social care and the NHS are not the only areas that will be hit.",3
"The Government tell us that the unemployment rate is currently close to its lowest, but that completely contradicts Ministers’ suggestions that immigration causes unemployment or creates slack conditions in the labour market, leading to low pay.",3
Will the new work visas allow that right?,3
We cannot accept that work visas are tied to specific employers and want reassurances that that will not be the case.,3
"Otherwise, the Government will be creating conditions of bonded employment, where the threat of dismissal implies the threat of deportation.",3
That would be disastrous for migrant workers and their families and detrimental to the interests of the entire workforce.,2
The number of migrants seeking ever more novel ways to get into the UK illegally is growing.,3
"Last week, it was reported that a record 416 migrants exploited fine weather to make the crossing from France to England in one day, arriving on beaches all along the south coast.",3
"Immigration law can be enforced by tightening border controls or by deporting those without a right to remain in our country, yet we see repeated reports of the failure of government steps to remove migrants who have already sought asylum elsewhere or have no right to remain for other reasons.",3
"Last week, a charter flight took off for Spain that was meant to carry 20 such migrants; in the event, only 11 boarded the plane, after late legal challenges.",3
"The week before, the Government abandoned a similar flight with 23 migrants on board, after last-minute legal action.",3
Yet immigration continues to increase.,2
"There are large numbers here illegally, both putting pressure on our public services and housing and risking ill treatment and exploitation—for example, in modern slavery or in dangerous low-paid working environments The Bill focuses on the EEA and Switzerland, and migrants arriving from those countries are not exempt from the problems that I highlighted.",3
"There is never-ending pressure on the EU’s southern and eastern borders, and the growth of hotspots of deprivation in EU urban centres.",2
"For example, the UK points-based immigration system, set out in CP 258 and at the useful briefing arranged by my noble friend the Minister, requires a huge new administrative structure post Brexit and an ESTA-style system involving millions of individuals every week.",3
"Add to that the pressure on our authorities of the illegal attempts I described earlier, the complications of Covid and post-Brexit trade, and you have a case for much more resource Fifthly, what scope is there for the use of technology to ease the obvious pressures on our enforcement?",3
"Finally, will the Minister take another look at the economics of deportation flights?",3
"Given the failure rate and the apparent ability of lawyers to delay deportation on flimsy grounds, I am sure it would be cheaper, in the longer term, than charter flights.",3
"My understanding at present is that for travel from 1 January 2021 no visa, or visa equivalents such as an ESTA, will be required for what are defined as short trips to the EU.",4
"However, I quote from the Government website on changes from 1 January: “You may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel.” Therefore, under the current withdrawal agreement—that said, almost everyone is concerned that this could all be thrown up in the air—is there agreement that visas will not be imposed on EU citizens coming here, or vice versa for short, tourist-related trips, but it is entirely open as to what will happen about visas or permits required for longer stays or for work, study or business travel?",3
My understanding is that short trips will definitely not be covered by visas or ESTAs.,3
"Also, what is the situation for other forms of travel, work and study, including business travel It may seem an unlikely alliance but I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Green, and the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Rolfe, about the integrity of the immigration system.",3
"In principle, their concern about the implementation of Clause 1 is well-founded, and it does not apply to policing and monitoring of the immigration system just for EU countries, but for other countries.",3
"This amendment, which is just a probing amendment, asks for a report after 90 days on what progress Government are making and their policy on security As our legislative stages are a process of mutual learning, I wonder whether I could put the debate back to the noble Broness, Lady Neville-Rolfe, and the noble Lord, Lord Green—particularly to the noble Lord, who is probably one of the greatest experts in the country on the detailed working of the immigration system.",3
"It would be useful for us to know, if they want to retable this amendment on Report, what specific changes and improvement to the policing of the immigration system they think Parliament should be considering.",3
The noble Lord referred to recent changes to the policing and detaining of asylum seekers and illegal migrants.,3
That might get a more fine-grained debate on Report on what further steps we should take to police the immigration system.,3
This Bill illustrates that the pandemic has revealed fundamental flaws in the present United Kingdom non-EU immigration system and the Government’s post-Brexit plans for immigration.,3
"The promise to take back control of borders may have appealed to nationalistic jingoism, but it was never rooted in the reality of modern Britain, where EU and non-EU migrants of all skills levels and income brackets keep the economic and social wheels turning.",3
"EU and other migrant workers were always, in fact, net contributors, through tax and national insurance, to the National Health Service, social care and other public services.",3
"Despite the Government’s intention to equate low pay with low skills and low value, the pandemic has abruptly brought migrants’ significant front-line roles as key workers in keeping the country afloat to the attention of the public, among whom it is now widely recognised, whereas perhaps it was not in 2016.",3
"As the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants has stated, the Bill “will deny our communities the care and professionalism contributed by migrants in these areas, to our own detriment.” The Bill does not set out in detail what the future points-based UK system will look like.",3
"Despite the Government’s claims that these powers are usual, they will diminish the role of Parliament in an area of policy where many, including the Lords’ Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in its 2019 46th report, have concluded that greater scrutiny is already required In the social care sector, on which millions of extremely vulnerable British people depend—many of them our relatives, in care homes and in their own homes—the vast majority of social care roles do not meet the planned immigration system’s salary threshold of £25,600.",3
"It also estimated that 5% of the 1.65 million workforce, or more than 80,000 staff, are at risk of losing their employment rights at the end of the transition period, in a sector where nearly half of employers are already struggling to fill existing vacancies because of low pay, anti-social hours and the demanding nature of care work The Government, in their wisdom, have decided that front-line social care staff will be excluded from their fast-track health and care visa, with the Home Secretary stating that this will encourage employers to invest in workers from the UK.",3
"In 2018, the Local Government Association estimated that adult social care services faced a £1.5 billion funding gap by 2019/20 and £3.5 billion gap by 2024/25.” While the points-based system is a fundamental change, other aspects of the non-EU immigration system such as enforcement, the right to bring dependants, settlement criteria, asylum, no access to public funds and more will remain unchanged when EU citizens without settled status become subject to them in 2021—next year.",3
"The pandemic has demonstrated that because of these policies, many such migrants are at significant risk of exposure to the virus, fear accessing healthcare, lack access to safe housing and are unable to stop working or to self-isolate because they are on poverty wages.",3
"This is not only detrimental to the health of migrant communities; the health of the wider public is also put at risk The Bill is a missed opportunity to deal with many more important questions, on which I support contributions and amendments from noble colleagues, including measures to combat modern slavery and indefinite detention, and to address family reunion for refugees and safe routes for unaccompanied children.",3
These unresolved issues mean that the existing UK immigration regime for non-EU immigration is already a stain on our national reputation.,3
"I should start by declaring that I am a vice-chairman of trustees of the Human Trafficking Foundation, a position I share with the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, who with her legal background is more able to discuss these matters I share the concerns of my noble friend Lord McColl that the anti-trafficking directive from the EU will not necessarily be implemented into domestic law; he has explained clearly the exact position.",3
"There has always been a conflict between the victims of modern slavery and the people who find them, who are often the same officers who check on illegal immigration.",2
"Many of the victims, certainly those not from the EU, could well be illegal immigrants.",2
"When they were EU citizens who had free movement, even if they were brought here under duress or false pretences they would not have been illegal immigrants.",3
"In theory, the fact that we are supposed to be taking control of our borders might well mean that we should be in a position to stop more people coming in who are actually victims, and particularly to try to stop the evil purveyors—the traffickers themselves I am proud that when the Modern Slavery Act was brought in, I was still in the other place and able to be part of that.",3
"My Lords, Amendment 8 concerns protections against deportation for Irish citizens.",3
"It might seem a little counterintuitive to noble Lords that it is necessary to provide protection at all because it is inherent, as it were, given our relationship with Ireland, the common travel area and so on Since 2007, the Government’s policy position has been to deport Irish citizens only where a court has recommended it in sentencing or where the Secretary of State concludes, due to exceptional circumstances, that the public interest requires it.",3
"It currently permits the deportation of Irish citizens in a range of circumstances, circumscribed by EU law relating to free movement.",3
"The position is particularly confusing, given that the Government have taken steps to remove Irish citizens from the automatic deportation regime.",3
"The legal position is not corrected by the Bill, and in fact Clause 2(2) weakens the protection because it does not put in place a replacement for the safety net that EU law has provided The Good Friday agreement envisages that Irish citizens from Northern Ireland should not, as a matter of law, be able to be excluded or deported from the UK, but that is not currently reflected in UK immigration law.",3
"Because British citizens cannot be excluded or deported from the UK there is a risk that, when an Irish citizen from Northern Ireland is threatened with deportation, they will have to assert British citizenship in order to continue to live in Northern Ireland.",4
"One of the categories of people that I am concerned about are non-documented—essentially, illegal—immigrants.",2
The idea that they might have Covid-19 but not seek medical help because they are fearful of what might happen with regard to their immigration status should be a matter of concern to us.,2
"I hope that the Government will make a statement to say that nobody will face detriment to their position by seeking help, and that deportation will not meet them at the end of recovery.",3
This Bill has been an affront to those migrant workers working on the frontline in social care.,3
"That would be particularly difficult to understand at a time when so many care occupations are central to the covid-19 pandemic frontline response These remarks should unsettle the Government and spur them into action, and I fully expect that if the Government do not listen, on the day that the new points-based immigration system is implemented we will still be deeply entrenched in the battle against coronavirus.",3
"If we do not do our due diligence by adopting this amendment, the Bill is set to undermine social care recklessly at a time when we can least afford it, so we urge the Government to reconsider their position, commission the impact assessment and understand the impact of the Bill on the social care workforce, on visas and on the consequences for recruitment, training and staff terms and conditions Amendment 4 would ensure there are safe refugee family reunion routes after Dublin III ceases to be available in the UK following the end of the UK-EU transition period.",3
I want to place on record my thanks to the brilliant and inspirational Lord Dubs for his tireless work and leadership on this amendment in the other place A great deal has been said about immigration over the summer and we on the Labour Benches want in the strongest possible terms to distance ourselves from the Home Secretary’s dangerous rhetoric and to thank those lawyers who play such an important role in ensuring that the UK is upholding its international and legal obligations.,3
Family reunion under Dublin III is currently the only legal pathway to reach the UK from the EU for the purposes of claiming asylum.,4
"Existing immigration rules also fail to cover this specific area, and therefore this amendment gives Parliament a chance to enshrine in law the basic principle of family reunion This issue is incredibly salient and our thoughts are still fixed on the suffering and horrors caused by the fire at the Moria refugee camp in Lesbos.",3
"We hear about the Government’s proposed fairer borders Bill on asylum, but those children cannot wait.",3
"The recent report, “It still happens here: Fighting UK Slavery in the 2020s” states: “For many, having no recourse to public funds poses further barriers to moving people on safely, putting victims at risk of homelessness and destitution, and making it more likely that they will fall back into exploitation and trafficking.” The one thing that we can learn from recent events in places such as Leicester, where we have uncovered the most appalling abuse of individuals who have been victims of slavery, working for a pittance and living in terrible accommodation, is that we really do not want to see that repeated in the UK.",3
They are not in the same boat as pure asylum seekers.,3
"I recognise that, perhaps today, this Bill is not the right way to try to press this matter forward, but I do say to the Government that there is another way I recognise also that the problem on that score is that a confirmed refugee can get five years’ leave to remain, but a confirmed—I repeat “confirmed”—victim of modern slavery gets no leave to remain at all.",3
"I understand the position in respect of failed immigration and people on asylum, but this is a very peculiar group that needs our care.",2
"The fact is that in the UK we have some of the most restrictive family visa immigration rules in the world, splitting up tens of thousands of British citizens and children from their spouses and parents.",4
"It is about protecting some of the most vulnerable people out there: people, including unaccompanied children, seeking asylum.",2
It is not just common sense but common decency that says that this is the right place for an asylum claim to be considered if the applicant has a family connection here or if it is in the best interests of a child.,4
"The Dublin system is far from perfect, but so many families have benefited from it, and indeed the UK has benefited from the system as well through the contribution that those asylum seekers and refugees have made.",3
"Alternative options in immigration rules, such as the exception route, are way too limited in scope and just will not do as an alternative.",3
"Having said that, I echo what Lord Dubs said when moving the amendment, which was that local authorities and the Home Office must also make sure that children entitled to British citizenship have full access to that without unnecessary fees and barriers.",3
"I pay tribute to Lord McColl and various other members of the all-party group on human trafficking and modern slavery, including the right hon.",3
"Our party will always support immigration leave being granted where that is required for such victims to put their lives back together, and that is exactly what Lord McColl’s amendment seeks to do.",3
"There are rights being lost for the victims of modern slavery from the European economic area, and we have not got ourselves into a place yet where those rights are being adequately replaced On the detention amendments, too many victims of modern slavery, far from being given a short grant of leave to remain to help rebuild their lives, end up instead in our hideous immigration detention estate, along with scores of others who should never be there.",3
"As we have heard, Lords amendment 1 flags up the huge danger that an end to free movement and the design of the future immigration system pose to the care sector.",3
"Some 7,400 family reunion visas were issued in the year to March, and there is also the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme and the hugely successful Dubs scheme, under which 480 children have come here.",3
"From 1 January, there will be no effective mandatory family reunion scheme either, and there will be no safe and legal route for these children to come to the UK I am tough on the illegal migrant channel crossings.",3
"I think many of those people who can afford to pay people smugglers are effectively jumping the queue ahead of those who are in refugee camps, who are going through due process and who are abiding by the rules.",3
"If we are going to be tough—and, gosh, we need to be tougher on those routes, which line the pockets of people smugglers—we need to make sure we have alternative safe and legal routes for those genuine vulnerable refugees, particularly children, to whom we have a duty of care and can offer a safe haven in this country Of course, this has come at the worst time, as we heard from the Labour Front Bencher, after the fires in Lesbos at the beginning of September, in camps that were already five times over capacity, with over 13,000 people residing in a centre built for 2,757.",3
"They should be rewarded with a pay rise, not threatened with deportation.",3
The purpose of the Bill is to close our borders with Europe.,3
It is not foreigners taking away jobs; it is this Government refusing to extend the furlough scheme.,2
It is not migrants running the NHS into the ground; they are keeping it going.,2
"It is not the place for broader changes to immigration policy in the areas of detention, asylum and care.",3
"As the Migration Advisory Committee and the Minister have said, immigration is not the solution to the challenges of the social care system.",3
"But our desire to change the immigration system in the future is not to denigrate those who have come here already and served this country so well, particularly during the pandemic.",3
"There should not be discrimination based on citizenship, and therefore EU citizens should meet the same requirements set out by our immigration rules— the points-based system that we will introduce—as non-EU citizens Lords amendment 2 would provide preferential family reunion rights under EU free movement law indefinitely.",3
The result would be that family members of such UK nationals could forever bypass the immigration rules that would otherwise apply to family members of other UK nationals.,3
"The British people voted to ensure the creation of a new immigration system built on fairness, not on nationality.",3
The creation of a lifetime right for one group of nationals would undoubtedly be unfair on other UK citizens living overseas who have family members from other parts of the world.,4
"It is absolutely clear that delivering control of our borders, both in terms of the total numbers who come here and the skills that people bring with them, was what the British people—and my constituents in Newcastle-under-Lyme—voted for, and that is what the Bill will let us do.",3
"I am proud to come from Liverpool, a city built on immigration from all corners of the world, which has contributed to the diversity and vibrancy of our culture and history and is what makes Liverpool great and the best city in the world.",3
"As a black woman, I am appalled by this Government’s treatment of asylum seekers, refugees and many migrants who seek to come here to contribute to our society.",2
"We took their service, their contributions and their taxes; then, towards the end of their lives, we took away their citizenship I know from first-hand experience the contribution that so many of our migrants—especially those in the care sector, in our NHS, in care homes and in the domiciliary care sector—have made to our society, but their reward is to be undervalued and poorly paid.",3
The Home Secretary’s proposed immigration system does not even count workers in the social care sector as skilled.,3
I urge the Government to rework the shortage occupation list to include these jobs I want to live in a country that welcomes immigrants and the contribution that they make and that offers a refuge to those who need it.,3
"Now that we have left the European Union, with the transition period and free movement coming to an end, whatever settlement we have in future—there is a debate to be had in this House about our asylum system, and we will have it at more length in the near future—it does not make sense to have a distinction between someone whose position is in the EEA and someone whose position is, for example, in Turkey, unless there are reciprocal arrangements that justify that difference of treatment The issue of children in care has rightly been a subject of some debate.",3
Let me be clear: EUSS does not require a passport or an ID card; alternative measures can be used to prove entitlement through documentation.,4
"We have to have a lawful basis for doing so, and that can only be where there is a reasonable prospect of removal or a threat to the public—although I accept that only a very small number of people are serious foreign national offenders On physical documentation, we are moving towards more digital statuses.",3
"As touched on, it will not just be EEA nationals with status under EUSS who will be using digital status—we also intend the route for British nationals overseas, who will also be moving to digital.",3
Member for Bath (Wera Hobhouse) talk about the idea of digital passports.,3
We are starting to look to the future where people may well travel on their biometrics and with digital identities rather than travelling purely on passports—although that is probably a few years away given that it would require technology being reciprocated in other nations I particularly enjoyed some of the speeches.,3
"It is not there to have the whole range of debate around immigration, but I respect the fact that people took the chance to do that.",3
"With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: New clause 2—Children in care and children entitled to care leaving support: Entitlement to remain— ‘(1) Any child who has their right of free movement removed by the provisions contained in this Act, and who are in the care of a local authority, or entitled to care leaving support, shall, by virtue of this provision, be deemed to have and be granted automatic Indefinite Leave to Remain within the United Kingdom under the EU Settlement Scheme (2) The Secretary of State must, for purposes of subsection (1), issue guidance to local authorities in England, Scotland, Wales and Norther Ireland setting out their duty to identify the children of EEA and Swiss nationals in their care or entitled to care leaving support (3) Before issuing guidance under this section the Secretary of State must consult— (a) the relevant Scottish Minister; (b) the relevant Welsh Minister; and (c) the relevant Northern Ireland Minister (4) The Secretary of State must make arrangements to ensure that personal data relating to nationality processed by local authorities for purposes of identification under subsection (1) is used solely for this purpose and no further immigration control purpose (5) Any child subject to subsection (1) who is identified and granted status after the deadline of the EU Settlement Scheme (“the Scheme”) will be deemed to have had such status and all rights associated with the status from the time of the Scheme deadline (6) This section comes into force upon the commencement of this Act and remains in effect for 5 years after the deadline of the EU Settlement Scheme (7) For purposes of this section, “children in the care of the local authority” are defined as children receiving care under any of the following— (a) section 20 of the Children Act 1989 (Provision of accommodation for children: general); (b) section 31 of the Children Act 1989 (Care and Supervision); (c) section 75 Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 (General duty of local authority to secure sufficient accommodation for looked after children); (d) section 25 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 (Provision of accommodation for children); (e) Article 25 of the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (Interpretation); and (f) Article 50 Children of the (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (Care orders and supervision orders) (8) For the purposes of this section, “children entitled to care leaving support” means a child receiving support under any of the following— (a) paragraph 19B of Schedule 2 Children Act 1989 (Preparation for ceasing to be looked after); (b) s.23A(2) Children Act 1989 (The responsible authority and relevant children); (c) s.23C(1) Children Act 1989 (Continuing functions in respect of former relevant children); (d) section 104 of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 (Young people entitled to support under sections 105 to 115); (e) sections 29-30 Children (Scotland) Act 1995 (Advice and assistance for young persons formerly looked after by local authorities) as amended by s.66 Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014 (Provision of aftercare to young people); and (f) Article 35(2) Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (Persons qualifying for advice and assistance.",3

"(8) Any person or their agent who is allowed under subsection (7) to require proof of registration has discretion to establish by way of other means than proof of registration that the eligibility requirements for settled status under the provisions of this section have been met (9) When a person within the scope of this section is requested to provide proof of registration of settled status as a condition to retain social security benefits, housing assistance, access to public services or entitlements under a private contract, that person shall be given a reasonable period of at least three months to initiate the registration procedure set out in this section if that person has not already registered (10) During the reasonable period under subsection (9), and subsequently on the provision of proof of commencement of the registration procedure and until a final decision on registration on which no further administrative or judicial recourse is possible, a person cannot be deprived of existing social security benefits, housing assistance, access to public services or private contract entitlements on the grounds of not having proof of registration (11) The regulations adopted under subsection (7) must apply to all persons defined in subsection (1) (12) A statutory instrument containing regulations under this section may not be made unless a draft instrument has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament (13) In this section— “EEA EFTA separation agreement” means (as modified from time to time in accordance with any provision of it) the Agreement on arrangements between Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the EEA Agreement and other agreements applicable between the United Kingdom and the EEA EFTA States by virtue of the United Kingdom’s membership of the European Union; “residence scheme immigration rules” has the meaning defined in section 17 of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020; “Swiss citizens’ rights agreement” means (as modified from time to time in accordance with any provision of it) the Agreement signed at Bern on 25 February 2019 between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Swiss Confederation on citizens’ rights following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from— (a) the European Union, and (b) the free movement of persons agreement; “withdrawal agreement” means the agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union which sets out the arrangements for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (as that agreement is modified from time to time in accordance with any provision of it).’ This new clause will ensure that all EU citizens have settled status (whether they’ve applied or not) and to require the Government to make available physical proof of settled status.",3
"Amendment 36, page 3, line 8, at end insert— ‘(5A) Regulations under subsection (1) must provide that EEA and Swiss nationals, and adult dependants of EEA and Swiss nationals, who are applying for asylum in the United Kingdom, may apply to the Secretary of State for permission to take up employment if a decision at first instance has not been taken on the applicant’s asylum application within 3 months of the date on which it was recorded.’ This amendment would require the Secretary of State to make regulations enabling asylum seekers to work once they have been waiting for a decision on their claim for 3 months or more.",3
"Amendment 32, page 3, line 28, at end insert— ‘(11) Subject to subsection (13), regulations made under subsection (1) must make provision for ensuring that all qualifying persons have within the United Kingdom the rights set out in Title II of Part 2 of the Withdrawal Agreement, the EEA EFTA separation agreement and the Swiss citizens’ rights agreement and implementing the following provisions— (a) Article 18(4) of the Withdrawal Agreement (Issuance of residence documents); (b) Article 17(4) of the EEA EFTA separation agreement (Issuance of residence documents); and (c) Article 16(4) of the Swiss citizens’ rights agreement (Issuance of residence documents) (12) In this section, “qualifying persons” means— (a) those persons falling within the scope of the agreements referred to; and (b) those eligible under the residence scheme immigration rules, as defined by section 17(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (13) Notwithstanding subsection (11), regulations must confer a right of permanent, rather than temporary, residence on all qualifying persons residing in the UK prior to such date as the Secretary of State deems appropriate, being no earlier than 23rd June 2016.’ This amendment would mean that EEA and Swiss citizens residing in the UK would automatically have rights under Article 18(4) of the Withdrawal Agreement (and equivalent provisions in the EEA EFTA and Swiss citizens rights agreements) rather than having to apply for them, and ensure that for the overwhelming majority, that status is permanent.",3
"Meanwhile, we have seen the Home Office move from disinterest in specific solutions for devolved nations to disdain bordering sometimes on contempt.",3
"Our amendments give Parliament a last chance to remedy these defects, and we will support other amendments that seek to find a silver lining to this Bill, such as amendments on putting a time limit on immigration detention, protecting care leavers, and protecting family reunion rights Turning first to the issue of family, sadly, this Bill will destroy more families by extending the scope of some of the most anti-family migration rules on earth.",3
"Five years ago, just three years after the rules were introduced, England’s Children’s Commissioner estimated there were nearly 15,000 Skype families in the UK—kids separated from a parent overseas because of these ludicrous financial thresholds.",3
"The Government’s stance is a boon for traffickers and people smugglers and a disaster for children and families, and that is why we must support new clause 29 This Bill is not just anti-family; it is anti-business.",3
"I have spoken enough at previous stages about the huge problems that salary and skills thresholds will cause when the new system is brought into force, but today I want to focus briefly on the problems that the Bill will cause even if a job qualifies for a visa under the tier 2 system.",3
"Figures from the international immigration law firm Fragomen show that under the future immigration system a tier 2 worker who enters the UK to work for five years with a partner and three kids could potentially involve a total payment to the Home Office of £27,000 upfront from October, once costs such as sponsorship licence fees and the immigration health surcharge are included.",3
"That is over 12 times as much as the equivalent for Canada and over 17 times as much as Germany, and it is similarly uncompetitive for other family arrangements Of course, skilled workers from the EEA are able to work in any other EEA country without paying a penny and with no need for the stress and uncertainty of a visa application.",4
"So if there is a skilled and sought-after French worker, that person can go to Dublin without paying a penny, no questions asked, but to get to Belfast they will need to pay many thousands of pounds and endure a Home Office visa process.",3
"That is why we have tabled new clause 17, so that the Government have to be upfront and open with Parliament about the costs they are imposing on businesses and unskilled workers It is also why we have introduced new clause 16, a first step to removing the ridiculous immigration health surcharge, which makes up most of these humungous fees—a nonsensical double poll tax on workers, which is set to increase to £624 per person per year, all of which needs to be paid upfront So this Bill risks making it very hard to attract European workers to come to the UK in future, but what of the EU workers who are already here and other EU nationals?",3
"Assuming, with regret, that the Government are not about to do that, they need to tell us much more about how they will respond when we wake up on 1 July next year to find an extra few hundred thousand undocumented EU migrants, without rights and potentially subject to removal.",3
"I didn’t think I needed to apply, but now the DVLA have refused my driving licence and they say I’m here illegally.” What is the Home Office going to do in such circumstances The Government say that they will be “reasonable”, but what exactly does that mean?",3
"For some reason known only to itself, the Home Office has now decided to insist on that when it comes to applications for citizenship.",3
"In law they have just as much right to British citizenship as you, Madam Deputy Speaker, or me; the only difference is that they have to register.",4
"When Parliament passed the relevant careful laws, the fee for the process was set simply at the cost of processing, but it has now rocketed to over £1,000—just to access British citizenship.",3
"New clause 24 would restore that provision, and I certainly hope that MPs from all parties who represent constituencies with remote areas will insist that the Home Office thinks again It is clearer than ever that the only way we will have an immigration system that remotely reflects our needs and circumstances and fixes the injustices that it contains is if we design one ourselves but, given the Home Office intransigence, I have no problem making the case that control over migration will be a key advantage of independence.",3
"However, the Minister knows that the draft text represents a major downgrade in support and rights for lone child and teen refugees.",3
All it does is allow EU member states to request the transfer of an asylum claim.,3
"Whatever other countries decide, we in Britain should continue our support for child and teen refugees who are alone and need support.",3
"No child should be abandoned alone in a dilapidated refugee camp or shelter when they have close relatives here who would welcome them with open arms, care for them, get them back into education and reclaim a future for them Some child and teen refugees have fled war or escaped being child soldiers.",4
"Without safe legal routes to sanctuary, they will be easy prey to trafficking and smuggler gangs, and we know quite how perilous that can be.",2
"That is why I urge the Minister to support new clause 29 New clause 30 is intended to ensure that the new immigration system helps rather than harms our economy and public services by calling for a proper assessment of its impact on social care, similar to that in new clause 1, which I support.",3
"Friend the Member for Halifax (Holly Lynch) on the Front Bench—about supporting the contribution made by many of those workers during the covid crisis, I also urge the Minister to accept the spirit behind one of the other clauses that we tabled which is not in scope today, but which urges the Government to extend the free visa extension to social care workers, as well as to the NHS, doctors and medics.",3
"The housing provisions do not benefit the immigration system, but they do lead to discrimination for legal residents and British citizens, including discrimination based on the colour of their skin.",3
"Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald) Immigrants have always played an integral part in the vitality of our communities, but we have been told, of course, that covid-19 changes everything.",3
That prompts the question: does it change how we handle immigration as much as it does our approach to health and the economy?,2
"There has been some interesting mention of the value of the high-skilled jobs that we will expect from this immigration policy, but it is worth taking a step back and considering how things have changed under covid.",3
I understand that 70% of people believe that the crisis has shown the key role of immigrants in running our essential services—the essential services that we have been clapping on the streets for many Thursdays; I think there is another clap here on Sunday—while 64% of people say that they now value so-called low-skilled overseas workers.,3
"We are now looking at who provides our services, and how, in a different way Surely what we have here is a hostile, inhumane immigration environment, and that is exactly what we should be questioning.",3
Does such an immigration policy reflect the sort of society that we hope to be after covid-19?,3
"Plaid Cymru’s proposal in new clause 11 challenges how this Bill presents a radical change in UK immigration policy without allowing a thorough debate about the details of its replacement or the implications—although, as can be seen from the nature of the amendments, there is much concern about those implications.",3
"Before we legislate, we should have a proper comprehension of the following: the impact of discriminatory “no recourse to public funds” conditions; the impact of NHS charging; the merits of removing all fees for visas and citizenship applications; and the merits of devolving powers over immigration to our nations, recognising the different needs of the different nations.",3
"Finally—crucially, in the current context—our new clause calls on the Government to investigate the possibility of granting citizenship to all health and social care workers who have given so much during this crisis.",3
A former Government did the right thing and granted citizenship to the Gurkhas.,3
Health and social care immigrant workers have been fighting heroically on two fronts.,3
They have fought on our behalf against the virus; they are now facing having to fight a hostile environment in the Government’s immigration policy.,3
The Office for National Statistics estimates that Scotland attracted only 8% of immigrants to the United Kingdom between 2016 and 2018.,3
Member for Argyll and Bute was right to draw attention to the effects that the changes to our immigration system will have on the health and social care sector.,3
"Although I do not support new clause 1, I urge the Government here and the Government in Edinburgh to work together to find imaginative and creative solutions to the issue, and to work with all stakeholders to see what can be done through the UK-wide immigration system to support and continue to grow the Scottish population, particularly with regard to the health and social care sector on which we rely so much.",3
"Before I move on, it would be remiss of me not to use the opportunity of a debate on immigration to talk about seasonal agricultural workers.",3
"Although I welcome the quadrupling of the seasonal agricultural workers scheme from 2,500 to 10,000 workers—a very welcome first step in this direction of travel—the needs of Scottish agriculture for seasonal labour are, in fact, considerably higher Numerous amendments and new clauses have been tabled to the Bill, and no doubt they all have a good intention behind them: Members want to create an immigration system that is fair, humane and understandable.",3
"We have presented an offer to the EU on the future reunion of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, where it is in the child’s best interests.",3
"For the UK to act unilaterally now—as the amendments seek us to do—would undermine the negotiations and make it less likely that we would secure a reciprocal arrangement, which might mean that the number of children we could help would be reduced We in this country are rightly proud of the steps that we have taken over the years to provide shelter to refugees fleeing war and persecution from around the world.",3
"We are rightly proud that so many people across the world seek to call the United Kingdom—this country—their home, and I am proud that in moving the Bill forward today we will be taking one more step towards making our immigration system fairer, non-discriminatory and fit for the 21st century.",3
"If they speak in public, they claim that it will introduce a points-based immigration system, which is not true.",3
"A plan that will exacerbate the crisis in the NHS and social care is one of the last things that this country needs The Bill in its current form is a disaster, so I am pleased to support the new clauses that would impose a strict 28-day limit on immigration detention; end the immigration surcharge, which should be ended for all; reform deportation law and citizenship fees for those who are brought to the UK as young children; and ensure that our moral obligation to child refugees for family reunion remains a legal one.",3
Such provisions would address the glaring issues of our immigration system There is a further issue that I want to raise.,3
The entire spirit and some parts of the letter of that review run completely counter to the whole thrust of this Government’s immigration policies.,3
"Back in 2014, I was pleased to serve as vice-chair of a cross-party inquiry into immigration detention.",3
"That was endorsed by the House of Commons in September 2014, so it is disappointing that we are still discussing the issue—but it is important that we are, because, contrary to some suggestions, it is not a particularly controversial proposal The truth is that we have become too dependent on detention, which takes place in immigration removal centres.",3
"One young man from a disputed territory on the border between Nigeria and Cameroon told us that he was trafficked to Hungary as a 16-year-old, where he was beaten, raped and tortured.",3
"He managed to escape and eventually made his way to Heathrow, using a false passport, which was discovered on arrival, and he was detained.",3
"There are more people like him than there are so-called foreign national offenders, which the Home Office briefers urged Members to refer to.",3
"No one tells you anything about how long you will stay or if you are going to get deported.” A medical expert told us that the sense of being in limbo, of hopelessness and despair is what leads to deteriorating mental health, and that “those who were detained for over 30 days had significantly higher mental health problems” It is not simply the impact on detainees that demands change.",3
"Removing indefinite immigration detention would make a significant contribution to achieving that culture change, because with no time limits, it has simply become too easy for people to be detained, for too long, with no meaningful way of challenging that detention.",2
"Our report gave a number of examples of alternatives to detention, which are being used by countries often held up as hard on immigration, such as Australia.",3
"For too long, we have seen uncontrolled immigration and a failure to remove those who have accepted our hospitality but sought to do us harm.",2
We have indeed seen lower rates of deportation.,3
"The Government have rightly agreed to extend the visas of frontline NHS workers, so I am mindful of new clause 35.",3
"They have rightly introduced a new NHS visa, offering fast-track entry to the UK for qualified overseas doctors and nurses under more generous terms.",3
"The contribution of all public sector employees, public servants and low-paid staff is the stuff of legend, and we will always be grateful For the avoidance of doubt, immigration is a good thing, and we have built a proud nation on the back of our history, shared values and unrivalled diaspora.",3
"I have been honoured to serve alongside so many brilliant foreign and Commonwealth soldiers, but there is a problem here, too.",3
"Once we have done this, we should then review the crippling visa fees, which remain beyond the reach of most servicemen and women and their young families Let us disincentivise those who come here via illegal means, remove those who commit serious crime and place the ruthless people traffickers behind bars, but the quid pro quo is to provide those whom we willingly invite to serve in our armed forces with the security they deserve.",3
"It is time that we did the right thing for all of our Commonwealth veterans and fully recognise the sacrifices that they too have made for our great nation As for the future of this Bill, I expect it to become law, but inasmuch as it promises a points-based immigration system that mirrors those of other countries in the free world, we need to be careful that it does not become a blunt instrument.",3
"To be worthy of its pre-eminence, the UK must take back control of its borders.",3
"I pay particular tribute to the migrant workers who are there, including too many who have lost their lives—consultants from Sudan, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Uganda and Pakistan, a hospital porter from the Philippines, doctors from Germany and Iraq, nurses from Zimbabwe, Trinidad and South Africa, support workers from India and Ghana, and many, many more.",3
"We should have had a Bill setting out a comprehensive and generous system of visa extensions for those frontline workers and their families, not the piecemeal, back-of-the-envelope scheme that the Home Office has so far cobbled together We need a Bill that scraps the minimum income requirements for family visas and suspends other financial thresholds, acknowledging that migrant families and workers have had their incomes slashed, just like too many others.",3
"There is absolutely nothing fair about that We need a Bill that uprates the pitiful sums of money that we are providing to asylum seekers in this time of crisis and which ensures that, whatever stage of their asylum journey they are at, they can be properly protected.",3
We need a Bill that ensures that all migrants have at least some form of temporary status and which ends the no recourse to public funds rules that deprive people of the support and accommodation they need to get through this crisis.,3
"It is impossible for someone to self-isolate if they do not have a roof over their head or food to eat We need a Bill that automatically protects all who are at risk of accidental overstaying until coronavirus is over, that gets people out of immigration detention, and that ends data sharing with the Home Office so that the NHS and other vital services are not places that people in need are afraid to attend.",3
"We need a Bill that postpones any new immigration system until this pandemic is over and we know the reality of the huge economic challenges ahead Employers are justifiably aghast at the fact that the Home Office is attempting to foist a whole new bureaucracy on them now, in the middle of a public health and economic crisis.",3
"The Government took four years to finalise their immigration proposals, yet they are giving employers little more than four months to adapt—four of the most difficult months imaginable.",3
"Just as before, the Government seem to be ignoring the warnings; instead, the Bill seeks to give Ministers a blank cheque on future immigration policies.",3
"The last thing we should do is give the Home Office any more powers until the lessons of Windrush are properly learned There are so many other areas of immigration, asylum and nationality laws that need fixing.",3
"There is nothing in the Bill to address the injustices of nationality law, such as the disgraceful fees charged to children who simply want to register their British citizenship, to which they are entitled.",3
"There is nothing to fix our broken asylum system —the poverty support rates, the chaotic accommodation contracts, the shambolic move-on period, the ban on work, the restricted family reunion rights, and the loss of Dublin III participation.",3
There is nothing here to address our addiction to immigration detention and the shame of being the only country in Europe without a time limit on detention.,2
"More and more people will be asking, “Why did we leave immigration policy to the Home Office at all?” Of course, on the question of who should make migration policy, with every single day of Home Office incompetence and injustice, the case for migration policy for Scotland being made in Scotland grows stronger.",3
Parliament has an opportunity to seek a broader consensus on what immigration and citizenship means for our country.,3
"However, we must recognise that immigration is a question of balance.",2
"However, a country’s having a sovereign say over its borders should not be confused with its being anti-immigration; as my party’s manifesto set out, it is more about offering a balanced package of measures that are fair, firm and compassionate The importance of the new immigration system is to identify and welcome the skills our country needs.",3
The proposed NHS visa is a good case in point.,3
"The ongoing health crisis has underscored the tremendous contribution and commitment that many healthcare workers from overseas make to our care; without them, our nation and our brilliant NHS could not cope Further, we have a commitment to the 3 million-plus EEA nationals who call Britain home.",3
"Only a few days ago, my friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster wrote to the European Commission to highlight the issues some of our fellow British citizens are encountering in seeking to guarantee their rights—issues that I reasonably foresaw and gave prior repeated warnings on to both successive UK Governments and the EU, for example during my meeting with Michel Barnier last July The immigration debate today also focuses on the new points-based system and visas for work immigration.",3
"That is, of course, a central and key part of the new immigration policy, but it is not the only aspect that warrants and deserves our attention.",2
"Just as the Government’s points-based system draws on the experience of Australia and Canada, there is much to be learned from their respective approaches to citizenship.",3
"It is estimated that the cost to the Home Office to process a citizenship application is about £370, yet the fee charged to an applicant is £1,330-odd, the highest amount in the western world.",3
"The combined cost for citizenship in Australia, Canada, France, Denmark and the United States is still less than the cost of an application for one British citizenship.",4
"This serves to highlight the huge disparity between our nation’s costs and those of nations such as Canada and Australia, whose immigration systems we are about to emulate I am currently chairing an inquiry involving colleagues from across the House and experts outside it, with the highly respected non-partisan think-tank British Future.",3
"The inquiry seeks to promote a new, proactive, measured approach and making citizenship fully part of our new perspective on immigration, and some of the practical ideas that could make that a reality.",3
"Therefore, in supporting this Bill today, I make this very modest request of the Government: to conduct a review of citizenship policy, to assess the current policies and processes from the perspective of the value of integration and shared identity that can be gained by encouraging the uptake of British citizenship.",3
"It is always a privilege to follow the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, and I will pick up on one or two of the things she said The core purpose of the Bill is to deliver on the 2016 mandate of taking back control of our borders, so it is no surprise that I wholeheartedly approve of that policy, although I say to those on both Front Benches that I have always presumed that control of our own borders allows us to create policies that protect the interests of sectors such as care homes and their dedicated workers, and I trust we will do that The House should also use this opportunity to put right some deep and long-standing injustices at the heart of our immigration system.",3
"As it stands, illegal migrants can be held and detained indefinitely in psychologically inhumane conditions.",2
"Detention is meant to facilitate deportation, but we routinely detain people for extraordinary lengths of time without deporting them.",2
"This flies in the face of centuries of British civil liberties and the rule of law For the most part, these detainees are not hardened criminals—they are frequently the victims of human trafficking, sexual assault and torture—yet we treat them as criminals, with little compassion at all.",3
"After days of travel, when the doors of her vehicle finally opened, she was not in China, but in rural Britain, where she was forced into prostitution and several years of unpaid work—slavery by another name—under threat of being reported to the immigration authorities.",3
"Anna’s story is not an isolated case; as a country, we detain about 25,000 individuals each year for immigration purposes.",3
That is why I intend to table amendments limiting migrant detention to 28 days and providing robust judicial oversight.,3
"For decades, people in this country have talked about immigration.",3
Some suggest that immigration was the main driver in making their decision to leave.,3
"I think that there were several reasons, but without doubt, immigration was clearly a key driver—the control of our borders and the ending of free movement A question was asked; a question was answered.",3
"To me, it is rather simple: a UK immigration system created and developed by the UK’s elected Government; a system devised in our national interest, determined by the needs of our economy; a system that treats immigrants from every corner of the globe on the same basis, which is all about what they are bringing to our country rather than where they are coming from The Bill means that the nurses, doctors, engineers and scientists from the Philippines, Canada, India or the USA will be treated equally to those from Germany, Italy or France.",3
The Bill is not anti-immigration; it is about fair immigration.,3
"At the same time, I am glad that the Government are working to welcome the migrants who make such a valued contribution to our NHS, extending the visas of frontline NHS workers and introducing a new NHS visa with fast-track entry and more generous terms I am happy to be talking about our borders because it is a subject that concerns many people in my constituency, but also because it is crucial at this time to secure our borders.",3
"Let us give the people what they want and what they voted for: a country in control of its own borders, with a fairer, firmer points-based system that will welcome the brightest and the best based on what they can contribute to this country and not on where they come from.",3
"Importantly for this country, which has always welcomed immigrants, the Bill will enable the alignment of treatment of EU and non-EU citizens as part of our future immigration system.",3
"In line with our manifesto commitments, there will be no automatic route into the UK for foreign workers with few formal qualifications.",3
"The new, fair immigration system will be flexible and in line with advice from the Migration Advisory Committee, which will keep the occupation shortage list under regular review to ensure that it reflects the needs of our labour market Immigration will no longer be used as a replacement for investment in the domestic British workforce.",3
"Most of us, except for those who support open borders, believe that countries should have an unalienable right to decide who gets to enter their land for work.",2
To seek and strive for such a right does not make us anti-immigrant—quite the opposite.,3
"It is right that people from all over the world are treated fairly and equally, so far as immigration into this country is concerned, under our rule of law.",4
"We have a rule of law allowing legal immigration from non-EU countries, but it has far too often been exploited by illegal immigrants and people smugglers and traffickers.",2
It is not right that those who have arrived here illegally are seen by some to have a presumptive right.,2
"People who avoid the law are not acting within the law, and are therefore acting illegally I welcome the introduction, from the end of the transition period, of a single, consistent and firmer approach to criminality across the immigration system.",3
"In my constituency of beautiful Hastings and Rye, we have seen hundreds of migrants land on our shores in small boats from France, most recently at Pett Level at the weekend.",3
"They are not refugees, as some insist on calling them.",3
"They are migrants, who move for a variety of reasons but who generally make a conscious choice to leave their country to seek a better life elsewhere.",3
"Their concerns are of safety and human rights, not economic advantage, and as such they seek asylum in the first safe country that they arrive in.",4
"They are not free to return to their homelands unless the situation that forced them to leave improves Worryingly, we have seen unaccompanied children arrive who are thought to be victims of trafficking.",3
"The people who have been landing on our beaches are coming over from France via unauthorised, illegal crossings, having paid thousands of pounds to a criminal—a people smuggler—to do so.",3
I want to be clear: we must press down hard on those exploiting the vulnerable and using them as part of their human trafficking system.,2
We must ensure that those caught up in human trafficking gangs and smuggling rackets are protected and that those orchestrating the journeys are stopped France is a safe country.,2
Under EU law—the Dublin regulation—asylum must be sought in the first country people arrive in.,4
"If we do not emphasise the difference between migrants and those seeking asylum or refuge, it promulgates misconceptions about the most vulnerable—the refugees, for whom we need to provide the best possible sanctuary.",3
"We need to safeguard and expand refugees’ rights and protect them Ultimately, we need to ensure that the British public have trust in our immigration system and remain welcoming of legal immigrants and refugees.",3
"That can be achieved with the new, robust, fair and independent migration system controlled by the United Kingdom, making sure that illegal migrants do not have not a presumptive right to stay—",3
"Last year, about 640,000 immigrants arrived in Britain.",3
"Of course that was about more than immigration, but for many, our inability to control our borders, and the consequent effects of large-scale net migration, was a salient factor in why they voted to leave the European Union and end free movement, which is what the Bill does The problem is exacerbated by the fact that too few people in the political establishment are prepared to face up to the sentiments I just described, which are widely felt by British people.",3
"It has displaced investment in technology, particularly in automation; it has held down wage levels, which has been undesirable both from the migrants’ point of view and for people already here; it has encouraged under-investment in training and skills, and it has built an economy that is increasingly ossified by a dependence on relatively low-cost labour rather than the high-tech, high-skilled economy that we need to compete and thrive.",3
"The reason we have borders is because it is right that the British people and those they elect to represent them should decide who comes to our country, in what number and why.",4
"First, we must deport more illegal immigrants.",2
"It is extraordinary that the recent Governments, the coalition and the Conservatives, are deporting fewer illegal immigrants than previous Labour Governments were.",3
"Secondly, we must be careful about the number of work visas issued.",3
"EU migrants contribute £2,300 more to the public purse each year than the average adult—and that is including the cost of their children being here, too.",3
"We are more likely to meet an EU migrant helping us in our hospitals than standing in front of us in a queue Over the past 20 years, immigration has been on a much larger scale than we have had in the previous 200 years, but, truthfully, however many people have come, this country has never been good at making it work.",2
"Indeed, it was the same with the Huguenots, the wave of refugees that brought both my family and Nigel Farage’s family here.",3
"Now, as we clap for those who are saving our lives with one set of hands, this proposed legislation asks us to abandon them with another The problem here is not immigration; it is politicians talking about what we do not want, rather than what we need.",3
"The only answer the Government are offering us about what replaces it is to expose everyone to the dysfunction that is the current immigration system—the same system that gave us the hostile environment, the Windrush scandal and the legacy system The former Home Secretary and former Member for Blackburn once told me there are two divides in Parliament: left and right; and those who have to deal with the UK Border Agency and those who do not.",3
"It is a system where, unlike in other countries in Europe, when we see refugee children, we do not seek to reunite them with their family members or provide them with safe passage to stop them being targeted by traffickers.",3
"Of the 25,000 people we locked in detention without any limit for how long, only 37% were eventually deported and yet we expect them to deal with this mess without any legal support.",3
It gives the Government Henry VIII powers to write immigration legislation without having to bring them back to this place and force us to address the damage that has been done.,3
"Take, for example, the immigrant who came to us having failed his exams with a patchy work history and no ties to the UK.",3
"Even then, in the 1930s, the UK border authorities misplaced his papers.",3
"Back then, the Daily Mail urged readers to avoid him and boycott his lectures raising money for other refugees from Nazi Europe.",3
"Back then, another MP, Oliver Locker-Lampson, tried to sponsor his British citizenship and help Jews fleeing the Nazis.",3
"Back then, we said no and we lost Einstein to America When it comes to immigration, our policies all too often meet Einstein’s definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting a different result.",3
"The problem is not immigrants, it is us.",2
"For years, the issues of Europe and immigration have stretched Governments and divided parties, but here is a chance to lay those ghosts to rest.",3
"In December, Britain voted for a Government who promised to deliver Brexit and end uncontrolled immigration, so this Bill does exactly what it says on the tin.",3
"Not only does it allow the UK to take back control of its borders, but it also helps our territorial sovereignty in a way that has not been possible for more than four decades.",3
"For a start, I was elected on the Conservative manifesto of 2019, which promised to end free movement across our borders and to restore trust in our immigration system.",3
"To use logistical terminology, it will be on a demand-pull, not a supply-push, basis For the avoidance of any doubt, immigration has been good for the UK, and we have built a proud global nation on the back of our history, shared values and unrivalled diaspora and those who have come here from abroad.",4
I have also been honoured to serve alongside many brilliant foreign and Commonwealth soldiers.,3
"That has nothing to do with racism or xenophobia, and those who are confused about that are wrong The Bill promises a points-based immigration system that mirrors other countries of the free world.",3
"Members will testify, what is happening now in Dover is unsustainable, and we must disincentivise those who seek to exploit the misfortune of others with promises of asylum.",3
"We must also ensure that those entering the UK on student visas do not become lost to the system, and it is right that the legislation further enables changes to social security arrangements and visas As contentious as the Bill might be to some, it is what many in Britain have requested for the past four decades.",3
"Is a pleasure to be back in the Chamber to speak on Second Reading of this Bill, which will end the EU freedom of movement and pave the way for a new points-based immigration system that treats everyone equally.",3
"Taking back control of our borders was one of the central reasons, if not the main reason, why millions of people up and down the country voted to leave the European Union almost four years ago.",3
"The Bill brings us one step closer to finally delivering on that historic verdict The desire to take back control of our borders is not to deny the immense contribution made by many people who have come here from overseas and will continue to do so in future; in fact, ending freedom of movement and building a points-based immigration system based on equality and individual merit will allow us to welcome more people from around the world who have so much to offer this country, On the contrary, taking back control is about ending the uncontrolled mass immigration that has disproportionately affected our working-class communities in recent decades.",3
"These communities have seen the increased pressure on their schools and hospitals, their wages have remained low, and there have been rapid cultural changes in the towns in which they live Although it is undoubtedly clear that the vast majority of those who have moved to our country under EU freedom of movement rules have made a positive contribution and integrated fully, the simple truth is that that has not been the case for everyone who has taken advantage of those rules, and many of our communities have been adversely affected because of that Today’s Bill gives us a power to continue to welcome into our country all those who wish to make a positive contribution to not just our economy but our society, while allowing us to say, “No,” to those whose impact is likely to be more dubious.",3
"Immigration was an issue snatched out of people’s democratic control, undermining their confidence in our political system, as well as in our ability to execute our fundamental responsibility as a nation to decide who enters our country We have an unmissable opportunity to restore the public’s confidence by building an immigration system that welcomes the best and the brightest from around the world while retaining democratic control and the consent of the people.",3
"Despite the clear support in the country for such reforms, the Labour party of today remains wedded to open borders and uncontrolled, mass immigration.",3
"When we debate the future of our immigration system, we need to touch on illegal immigration, although I appreciate that that will be dealt with in a separate Bill.",3
"For public confidence in the system today, tackling illegal immigration must be one of the key issues that we confront.",2
"While thousands of people continue to break our laws by operating outside of our legal immigration system, the public will not have full faith that we have control of our borders.",2
"I urge the Government to build on the important work in this Bill by giving further consideration to how we tackle illegal immigration over the coming weeks and months As I said at the start of my speech, the Bill has my full support because it ends freedom of movement, gets us ready for a new global immigration system and helps to restore public confidence in the integrity of our borders.",3
"There is still more work to be done, and we cannot count on the Labour party’s support in doing it, but the era of uncontrolled and undemocratic mass immigration is certainly coming to an end, and that should be welcomed.",3
"I therefore encourage them, over the weeks to come, to collaborate with Members who share some of their concerns It is also right to recognise that controlling the borders of the United Kingdom was a fundamental reason why the majority of people in our country voted to leave the European Union.",3
We support the principle of ending uncontrolled immigration and treating those wishing to enter the UK from the European economic area and the rest of the world fairly and equally.,3
"Such provision was enshrined in national law well before either country joined the EU and was never going to be threatened by the UK’s exit from the EU We do, however, express concern at the Government’s recent decision to amend the settlement scheme to allow family members of British and British-Irish citizens dual citizenship.",3
"The reality is that citizens born in Northern Ireland under the Belfast agreement have the right to both Irish citizenship and British citizenship, but it is in addition to British citizenship, not instead of it.",4
"Officials should be looking at reasons why status should be granted, as opposed to reasons why it should not be, and clarity is required on the reasonable grounds for missing an application The DUP supports a compassionate and open approach to refugees from communities in other countries affected by terrorism, war or persecution.",3
"We believe that consideration should be given to mitigations for family members of EEA citizens who have been convicted of domestic abuse and whose status in the UK could be linked to their perpetrators In terms of the new points-based system, the intention to implement a single skills-based system of immigration in the UK, treating all migrant workers from anywhere in the world on a fair and equal basis, is a welcome development.",3
"If the British people decide they want a different approach in future to agriculture, trade or immigration, they can now vote for it at a general election.",3
"But we have left the European Union, which means that, for the first time in more than 40 years, we can deliver control of immigration by ending freedom of movement and replacing it with a considered and considerate approach that will command the trust of the British people.",3
I pay tribute to all those NHS workers—immigrants or otherwise—who have gone above and beyond in these last few months in helping to respond to this terrible pandemic.,3
"The new NHS visa will offer fast-track entry to the UK for qualified overseas doctors and nurses and will provide three to five-year work visas with reduced up-front fees, and we have already removed doctors and nurses from the tier 2 visa cap Similarly, as a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I welcome the Government’s intention to make it easier to attract leading scientists, engineers and mathematicians to come and work in the UK.",3
"More generally, I know that the Government are listening to advice to ensure that this new immigration system will be flexible enough to meet the needs of businesses and essential services.",3
"The wider rights enjoyed by Irish citizens in the UK, which flow from the common travel area arrangements, will also be maintained The Bill and the new points-based immigration system obviously represent a significant departure for our country, but one that emphasises and reinforces a positive social change.",3
"We remain one of the most welcoming and tolerant countries in the world, and, as Ipsos MORI recently found, people are more willing than ever to say that immigration has had a positive impact on Britain, a sentiment I have always shared.",3
"It is absolutely clear that delivering control of our borders, with regard to both the total numbers coming and the skills they bring with them, was something that the British people, and my constituents in Newcastle-under-Lyme, were asking for in both the 2016 EU referendum and the 2019 general election.",3
"The Government set out in their manifesto at that election that they would deliver a new points-based immigration system to attract the best talent from all around the world, as the Bill enables.",3
The British people have demonstrated in two historic votes that they want an approach that returns control of our borders to this House—to them.,3
"Under this Government, citizenship rights have been deliberately obscured, and deportation and removal targets have taken precedence, yet the Bill makes no effort to end these hostile environment policies, which were found to be institutionally racist by the official inquiry into the Windrush scandal.",3
"It is not as if there are any planes going anywhere, so why is that happening As MP for one of the most diverse constituencies in the country, I know only too well the hurt that my constituents feel when the Government legitimise the dehumanisation and marginalisation of African, Asian and minority ethnic communities with their deport first, ask questions later approach.",3
"Our health service simply would not function without the sacrifice of people from across the world, yet if a migrant NHS worker tragically dies because of work-related illnesses, it is their belief that the future of their dependent family members living in the UK is not guaranteed.",3
That means that vulnerable individuals could face deportation while grieving for their loved one.,3
Guarantee now the indefinite leave to remain for family dependants of all migrant NHS workers who are keeping our society going.,3
"I have written to the Home Secretary urging her to close this loophole in order to honour the dedication and sacrifice of all NHS workers, no matter their country of birth On that note, let me say how deeply disappointed I was that the Government have refused to reconsider the pernicious immigration health surcharge.",3
"I have also called on the Government to introduce an amnesty for all migrants, including residency rights, for the duration of the pandemic and to end the callous no recourse to public funds policy.",3
"At a time when hate crime has more than doubled since 2013, with more than 100,000 offences in 2018, it has never been more important for the demonisation of migrants to end.",3
"That means repealing the Immigration Act 2014, reversing the hostile environment, and shutting detention centres for good I will conclude with the worrying provision in the Bill that grants sweeping new powers to the Government to change immigration laws without proper scrutiny.",3
"This Government’s systematic mistreatment of migrants over the past decade, from the hostile environment to the Windrush scandal, is the ultimate proof that they are undeserving of this unchecked power.",3
"Let us be absolutely clear that, contrary to what we are being told, this Bill does not set out a blueprint for a new immigration system.",3
"Ministers insist that the Henry VIII powers enshrined in the Bill are standard practice, but since when did any Parliament trust a Government, be it Conservative or Labour, to implement sweeping reforms of the immigration system without parliamentary oversight?",3
"I think most colleagues would agree that immigration is an area of policy where we should be seeking greater scrutiny, not less.",3
"Given what Ministers are asking, we would assume that they had a plan for what their new immigration system will look like, but as far as I can tell—I am happy to be corrected if I am mistaken—they do not have any such plan We are endlessly reminded of the Government’s plan for an Australian points-based system, but are provided with no detail on what this would look like in the British context.",3
"History demonstrates the callous attitude of numerous Conservative Home Secretaries towards immigrants in this country, and the creation of the hostile environment and the ensuing Windrush scandal epitomise this cruelty.",3
"This Bill presents an opportunity to do justice, yet rather than dismantling the hostile environment, this Government have chosen instead to subject a further 3.4 million EU citizens to the inhumanity of their existing policies The unprecedented crisis we are facing at the moment, brought on by coronavirus, has shone a light on the critical role migrants play in our society.",3
"We have seen a new appreciation of so-called low-skilled workers, redefined overnight as key workers, and the people occupying these undervalued and underpaid roles are often migrants.",3
"This crisis has shown that our country needs migrants, our health service needs migrants and our social care system needs migrants.",2
"The Government could and should use this legislation to recognise the service of migrants to our country, and ensure they are treated fairly and humanely by the Home Office.",3
Root-and-branch reforms of our immigration system are long overdue.,3
"It is high time we saw a 28-day time limit on immigration detention, a review of the health surcharge and visa costs, an expansion of refugee family reunion rules, and the protection of vulnerable and unaccompanied children to ensure that they are able to join family.",3
"I welcome this Bill, which brings in a points-based immigration system to ensure that immigration is controlled and that we have the skilled workforce that we need not just from the European Union but from around the world.",3
"Yet, while it is important to gain immigration status for the people with the skills that we need, it is also important that we have effective border security, particularly when freedom of movement comes to an end Last December, I was pleased to accompany the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon.",3
"France is our long-term ally, but it is also our nearest European border.",4
"These illegal entrants can pay the traffickers up to £4,000 to break into our country, knowing that there is little or no chance of being returned once they get in.",3
I strongly welcome the robust work of the Home Secretary in working afresh with France to stop more boats leaving the French shores and seeking to return would-be illegal entrants to France.,3
"However, it is incumbent on us, as Members of this House, to give the Home Secretary the legal tools that will support her and the Government in their clear determination to put a stop to this criminal trade in people, and to ensure that we can attract the skills that our country wants and needs from across the globe This Bill is about restoring the legal powers to control our own borders, to set our own rules, to encourage and welcome those we invite to our country, and to send away those who engage in criminal activity, such as illegal entrants.",3
"In Dover, we know that it is only when people traffickers and migrants alike know that they will not succeed in breaking into Britain that we will bring an end to these small boat crossings—and bring an end to them we must.",3
There has already been loss of life in the English channel through this illegal activity.,3
"Every day longer that the activity continues, it risks further loss of life I welcome the Bill, which brings in a points-based immigration system to ensure that immigration is controlled and that we have the skilled workforce that we need, not just from the EU but from around the world, together with a framework for effective border security, to stop criminal activity and to save lives.",3
"It is a pleasure to formally welcome the new shadow immigration Minister to her post; I have not had the chance to do so before at the Dispatch Box The breadth of views expressed by Members today clearly demonstrates how important an issue this is, not only to our constituents but personally.",3
"Given the unusual circumstances in which we meet, I will not have time to give a detailed response to each point raised, but will seek to respond to the broad themes that have been brought out in the debate The Bill is before the House not only to deliver on our manifesto pledges, but to lay the framework for our new immigration system, which will be fairer because we will treat people from every part of the world equally, while respecting our historic links with Ireland and the Belfast agreement, and firmer, because we will have control of our own borders from 1 January and all migration policy will be in the hands of this Parliament.",3
"It will be skills led, because the system will be based on the skills, talents and qualifications that people can bring to this country, not two radically different systems based on where someone’s passport comes from Let us be clear: this is a framework Bill, not an immigration shopping list.",3
"Imagine our having to pass primary legislation to amend visa end dates, automatically renew NHS workers’ visas, grant waivers to in-country route-swapping conditions or allow tier 4 sponsors to move courses online.",3
"Hence this Bill, in common with those on this subject that came before it, does not replicate the immigration rules in statutory form, and neither should the House regret its not doing so We have already moved to create the first part of our new migration system with the creation of our global talent route.",3
Our immigration system should allow them to do so I hear the frustrations of those who see our migration and humanitarian protection system being abused by those who engage in human trafficking—as highlighted well by my hon.,3
Friends the Members for Dover (Mrs Elphicke) and for Hastings and Rye (Sally-Ann Hart) —and the risks being run by those using small boats to cross the channel.,3
"We accepted its key recommendations: a reduction in the general salary threshold for the key skilled worker visa from £30,000 to £25,600; moving the skills threshold from degree to A-level, to ensure that we include those with significant skills levels, such as senior carers; and tradable points, with a salary floor of £20,480 for jobs on the shortage occupation list or where significant potential is shown by holding a relevant STEM-based PhD.",3
"This will be via not only the points-based system being based on national salary scales for roles such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists, but an NHS visa, which includes discounted fees and fast-track application processes for those with a job offer from our NHS or for those providing services to it.",3
"However, we will not create a minimum wage general migration route Alongside creating our new points-based global migration system, we are also taking the chance to work on a long overdue simplification of the immigration rules.",3
Many will not be headline-grabbers but changes that will make it easier for those who need to use our immigration system to both understand the requirements and to comply with them.,3
The European settlement scheme is the largest documentation of immigration status in UK history.,3
"The European settlement scheme means those entitled can prove their status easily for the rest of their lifetimes, while also ensuring that those who arrive in years to come cannot abuse the scheme’s provisions We recognise that immigration is vital to the social, cultural and economic life of this country.",3
"The Bill is the first step in ending free movement, establishing a fair and equal immigration system and upholding the scientific and commercial excellence of our country.",3
"It is quite clear that they are happy to pile chaos upon chaos Today’s motion and debate are also about nationalism and those who are obsessed by borders—and by that, of course, I mean the British nationalists, who think that the decline of the UK was due to the malign influence of the EU; those nationalists who are obsessed with controlling the UK borders and keeping people out; the very ones who cling to the glory days of the empire and think that the empire will return.",3
"As it stands at the moment, if we remain in a UK that is out of EU, students from the EU who apply to a Scottish university will initially be given only a three-year study visa—a visa that is not even long enough for them to complete their four-year course in Scotland.",4
"That is a simple example of how Scotland does not matter and does not figure when the UK formulates policy, particularly in respect of immigration.",3
"It is always based on what the Tory Government think England wants and how the voters in England will react We know that Scotland relies on immigration for growth, and we actually value those who come and work for the NHS.",3
"Scotland simply cannot afford to be wedded to an immigration system designed for the south-east of England: as well as being inward-looking, it would cost Scotland financially and economically Bizarrely, despite the Tory Government’s obsession with controlling the UK borders, they are not actually in a position to do so if they leave without a deal in December.",3
It certainly will not deal with the problem of the Irish border and the fact that there promises to be no new infrastructure.,3
"There is no IT system available at the moment that can actually do what they claim it can On that, the one aspect the International Trade Secretary understands is the fact that the UK risks being a smugglers’ charter.",3
"It is such a risk that she believes the UK could be subject to a challenge from the World Trade Organisation, basically because of the UK’s desire for no border checks for EU imports to Great Britain for the first six months of 2021.",3
How is that taking control of your borders?,3
"The International Trade Secretary also highlighted that there is a lack of plans and timescales for tariff declaration systems, border controls and necessary infrastructure for ports in the UK.",3
"While 17% of Scottish exports go to the 27 member states of the EU, 60%—over three times more—of Scottish trade goes to the rest of the United Kingdom, and a similar value flows back over the border Fifty years ago, my mum and dad moved to the UK, leaving behind their families and friends, because the UK represented the values that meant so much to them and which mean so much to me as well—indeed, they are referenced in the Scottish document: human dignity, freedom, democracy and equality of opportunity.",3
"Recently, when Hong Kong’s freedoms were threatened, the UK stepped up to the plate, not just by raising concerns with China but by inviting up to 3 million British national overseas passport holders and their dependants with open arms to move to the UK As someone from an immigrant background, I can say that these islands represent hope and opportunity.",3
Lords amendment 4B relates to family reunion and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.,3
"Let me reiterate very firmly that the Government are determined to end these dangerous, illegal and unnecessary crossings to ensure that lives are not lost and that ruthless criminal gangs no longer profit from this criminal activity As my right hon.",3
"Friend the Home Secretary recently announced at the Conservative party conference, we intend to reform our broken asylum system to make it firm but fair.",3
It will also be firm and stand up for the law-abiding majority by stopping the abuse of the system by those who raise no founded claims through protected routes but do so purely to frustrate the implementation of our immigration law and procedure Let me reassure hon.,3
"We have a very proud record of providing safety to those who need it through our asylum system and world-leading resettlement schemes, and we are determined that that continues.",3
"The UK continues to be one of the highest recipients of asylum claims from unaccompanied children across Europe, receiving more claims than any EU member state in 2019, and 20% of all claims made in the EU are in the UK The Government understand the importance of this issue, and it is right that we continue to debate it.",3
Lords amendment 4B is well-intentioned in seeking to ensure that adequate protection is in place for vulnerable asylum-seeking children.,3
"However, we have made a credible and serious offer to the EU on new arrangements for the family reunion of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.",3
"As my noble Friend Baroness Williams announced in the other place on 21 October, in the event of no negotiated outcome, we will pursue bilateral negotiations on post-transition migration issues with mutual interest countries, including on family reunion for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.",3
"Government policy has not changed on this matter However, it is worth noting that the UK already provides safe and legal routes for people to join family members in the UK through our existing immigration rules, all of which are unaffected by our exit from the EU, as they apply globally.",3
"In the year ending June 2020, the Government issued 6,320 refugee family reunion visas and have issued more than 29,000 in the last five years.",3
"This shows that our existing refugee family reunion routes are working well, and these routes will continue to apply, including to people in the EU, after the transition period.",3
"During the debate in the other place on 21 October, the Government committed, as part of this vital work, to conduct a review of safe and legal routes into the UK, including those for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in EU member states to reunite with family members here in the United Kingdom The substantive amendment that the Government have tabled in lieu, amendment (a), makes important statutory commitments, demonstrating the Government’s assurances to review legal routes to the UK for people seeking protection in EU member states or seeking to come to the UK to make a protection claim, including for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children to join their family members here in the United Kingdom; to publicly consult on legal routes for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in the EU seeking to join family members in the UK; to lay a statement before Parliament providing further details of that review and public consultation within three months of the Bill receiving Royal Assent; and to prepare a report on the outcome of the review, publish it and lay it before Parliament.",3
"It is important that we consider these routes, to discourage vulnerable children from making the dangerous and illegal journeys that can result in the kind of tragedy we saw last week.",3
"That is in line with our new global approach to the future immigration system and ensures that there is no advantage to making a dangerous journey across the Mediterranean, often organised by criminal trafficking gangs.",3
"Although we do not have a problem with the Government’s amendments—on the contrary, we welcome the opportunity to review all the safe and legal routes available to those fleeing war, torture or persecution and who have grounds to seek asylum in the UK—the review offered still falls a long way short of the commitment that we have asked for in Lords amendment 4B The review is a welcome addition to the Bill, but the fact that it is to be introduced through an amendment in lieu of ours makes it feel somewhat hollow by comparison.",3
"Friend the Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), through their work on the Home Affairs Committee, have championed the merits of continuing the routes for unaccompanied child refugees We ask the Minister one more time to reflect on why adopting the Dubs amendment in its entirely is not just critical but time-critical.",3
"We debate the amendment today with 56 days to go until the Dublin regulations end, and with them the lifeline they offer, and we fall back on the immigration rules.",3
"The sinking of just one of those insecure boats just last week resulted in the loss of life of four people, two of them children who were just six and nine.",3
"It demonstrates that the morally bankrupt traffickers, who allow children and adults alike to get into their dangerous boats and set off to sea in bad weather, will continue to exploit people in the worst possible ways unless we reopen and continue those safe and legal alternatives, family reunion being one of them The deliberations and ping-pong between the two Houses on the matter of family reunion or the question of accepting unaccompanied child refugees should not be politically contentious.",3
"We are a decent and humanitarian country that takes seriously the requirement, enshrined in international law, to consider asylum claims and offer refuge to those fleeing persecution and destitution, and the Minister has rightly spoken of our country’s proud record on that When the House previously considered Lords amendments to the Bill, the Government rejected Lords amendment 4—the earlier version of this amendment—citing financial privilege, as is so often the parliamentary way.",3
"I heard the Minister’s contribution and read his letter earlier today, and it remains the Government’s goal to seek new arrangements with the EU for the family reunion of unaccompanied child refugees.",3
"The Government’s rhetoric on the anticipated sovereign borders Bill has not given us hope on that front, but if he is serious about finding a way forward and continuing the family reunion co-operation that we are currently committed to, I urge him to support the amendment.",3
"He also talked about how those who relocated from Syria or the region had resettled and been integrated into life in Strangford, with excellent support, I am sure That brings me on to the interesting speech from my hon.",3
"The Government’s view is that now that we have left the European Union and the transition period is coming to an end, we are moving away in our wider immigration system from the idea of a two-tier approach to non-EEA and EEA.",3
"This is one of the reasons why I have had very interesting conversations with the Lord Bishop of Durham about the idea of talent beyond borders, looking at how we can open some of our economic migration routes for those who are skilled migrants—who have skills and abilities—who are currently in camps in the region and have been identified as potentially even having skills that are in shortage in this country That is where the core of the discussion goes.",3
"Local authorities are already caring for over 5,000 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children—146% more than in 2014—and any move in a policy sense has to be balanced in terms of ensuring what offers are made locally.",3
"My local council, not controlled by my party, wrote to me earlier this year saying that we should be doing more for refugees across the world in resettlement, particularly in Europe.",3
Is a police station envisaged or just home?,3
"What about people who, for one reason or another, do not have a home to go to—the street homeless, sofa surfers, victims of domestic abuse, some immigrants and refugees, who get little or no support?",3
I will perhaps have more chance tomorrow to raise concerns about immigration powers as they affect people in immigration detention as well as in prison.,3
"The Minister explained that some of the Government’s coronavirus measures—quite generously, one might say—applied to those with no recourse to public funds, who are the subject of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Bennett I believe that migrants coming into the UK should be able to maintain and support themselves and their families without posing a burden on our hard-pressed benefit system.",3
"I do not know much about the detail of the arrangements for prohibiting access to public funds, but I know that taxpayers already foot large bills for lawyers to prioritise immigrants’ needs and to block the deportation of those who do not have the right to remain We cannot introduce an immigration system, as posited here, that has the effect of attracting migrants—whether from the EU, which is today’s subject, or elsewhere—for welfare benefits and not for work.",3
"In short, those who are, in reality, economic migrants should be contributors to the public purse, as I think many are.",3
"My family came to Britain as refugees from Uganda, so I understand how it feels to leave the only country you have ever known behind.",4
"They saw themselves as British, with their right to citizenship enshrined in law, but the treatment they received from some of their fellow Britons was less than welcoming.",3
Not only the immigrants but their children have been badly treated I therefore wholeheartedly welcome the Government’s efforts to put right these grave injustices through the Windrush compensation scheme.,3
"Many lost their jobs, were evicted, detained in migration centres, denied medical treatment, or may have been deported.",3
"British citizens have been wrongfully detained and deported, lost jobs and been prevented from returning home from abroad.",3
So people are caught between situations as they try to find appropriate evidence and to avoid contact with the authorities for fear of being deported or detained.,3
"This fear has led to great problems in finding enough documentary evidence to support claims More than 12,000 people who were wrongly classified by the Home Office as illegal immigrants have now been given citizenship or some other form of documentation proving that they have, and always had, the right to live in the UK, but there are more than 3,700 outstanding cases with the Windrush taskforce.",3
One can envisage that being a major hurdle for many claimants after so many years have elapsed.,3
"The tariff awards provide for a maximum of £10,000 plus for deportation; awards for detention based on the length of that detention; awards for loss of access to employment up to a maximum of £1,147 of actual monthly net pay; denial of access to child benefit, child tax credit or working tax credit at £1,264, £2,500 and £1,100 respectively; denial of access to housing services at £1,000; denial of access to free NHS care at £500; denial of access to higher education at £500; denial of access to banking services at £200; and homelessness at £250 per month, up to a maximum of £25,000 Then we come to the tariff awards under the heading “Impact on Life”.",3
"These are meant to cover injury to feelings, including anxiety, distress and reputational damage; family separation; immigration difficulties when attempting to return to the UK; and deterioration in physical or mental health.",3
"In practice, it is clear that there are many caps There is provision for discretionary awards under the scheme, but it does not look as though that discretion is going to be exercised too often, since the impact assessment says, under the “Discretionary Award” heading, “Due to lack of data, this loss category has not been included in the analysis.” In the impact assessment, under the heading “Benefits” of compensation, it is revealed that: “The Government will also mitigate the risk of litigation and associated legal costs, which is likely to be more expensive than compensation through the scheme.” Under the heading “Objectives”, the impact assessment says that the scheme “minimises the risk of litigation” and “operates as cost effectively as possible while meeting the above objectives”, one of which is that it “seeks to compensate eligible individuals for certain financial losses they have experienced as a result of difficulty in demonstrating their lawful immigration status.” If the scheme is to compensate only for “certain financial losses” experienced, can the Government spell out the kind of financial losses experienced that are not covered by the scheme The scheme has obviously been drawn up in part with a view to saving money on costly legal proceedings.",3
We do not want a similar situation arising over citizenship rights in the light of our withdrawal from the EU In March the Government said that they would bring forward a detailed formal response to the Williams review recommendations in the next six months.,3
"On the first question, about the asylum track, after somebody arrives—having come, we believe, from a safe country where they could have claimed asylum—and if they are declared inadmissible, we will seek for a short period to get the agreement of that other country to return them there, where their asylum claim can be substantively and properly considered.",3
"If that is not possible, the asylum claim will of course be substantively and properly considered in this country My right hon.",4
Friend asked some questions about our asylum system more generally—I think she was in some way seeking to insinuate that it was not reasonable or fair.,3
"The accommodation that we provide is reasonable and good, and there are 60,000 people currently being accommodated In terms of our system more widely, last year we made 20,000 grants of asylum or other forms of protection—that is a very high number.",3
"We welcomed and received more unaccompanied asylum-seeking children last year than any other European country, including Greece.",3
"In addition to what I have described, last year over 6,000 people came into the UK under the refugee family reunion routes, which of course continue to exist The purpose of these changes is to prepare us for life after Dublin, and it is quite right that we make preparations, but at the heart of this is a desire to dissuade people—indeed, prevent people—from making unnecessary and dangerous journeys, particularly across the English channel, endangering their own lives and feeding ruthless criminal people smugglers, and all for no purpose, because France is a safe country where asylum can easily be claimed, as are the other European countries these migrants have travelled through My right hon.",3
"Gentleman will know that the asylum system in general does provide support, accommodation and other support, the cost of which is getting on for £1 billion a year, so it is generous in nature.",3
"He talks about the refugee problem around the world, which we recognise.",3
That is one reason why we spend a great deal of money on overseas aid.,2
"Friend the Member for Torbay (Kevin Foster), set up the points-based immigration system with the Home Secretary, which went active very recently.",3
"It is essential that people either claiming asylum or entering the country for work and other purposes do so legally, and all Members of this House, including the former Leader of the Opposition, should be very clear with migrants in Europe that they should not attempt this dangerous crossing and they should not pay dangerous people smugglers.",3
"During this transition period, the Dublin regulations have given the UK temporary power to transfer refugees and migrants back to the EU country from which they arrived.",3
"As the ever-shifting deadline looms, I understand that the Home Office has sped up its asylum seeker processing in an attempt to deport vulnerable immigrants, including suspected trafficking victims, before the year’s end.",3
I have dealt with a lot of cases of trafficking victims in Ilford South.,3
Will he consider ending deportation until robust and proper screening is implemented?,3
"My Lords, 2020 has begun with a flurry of national debates, on HS2, on Huawei and the 5G network, on the upcoming Budget, and on the implications of Brexit, which happens tomorrow, and, of course, we anticipate debates all year on immigration and the situation in our health service However, while our political debates may be dominated by domestic concerns, elsewhere in the world this year will also see the 75th anniversary of the United Nations and the 20th anniversary of the momentous UN Resolution 1325, which set out a programme for women, peace and security that has influenced work in that area ever since.",3
"These international concerns should stand for us alongside those domestic debates as being at least of equal importance It was with that in mind that I was so pleased to see in the gracious Speech the Government’s commitment to undertake an integrated security, defence and foreign policy review “to reassess the nation’s place in the world, covering all aspects of international policy, from defence to diplomacy and development.” I was equally pleased to see that followed in the gracious Speech by the strategic objective set by the Government for these international relations of the promotion of peace and security globally.",3
"Within that context there can surely be no doubt now, in 2020, that an integrated approach to defence, diplomacy and development is central to meeting the challenges we face in the 21st century In the UK we have, for two decades now, seen the progressive integration of our policy approach in government to defence, diplomacy and development.",3
"None of the problems that we debate regularly in this Chamber and that we see having such an impact, not just in other places but here, too, can be solved without an integrated approach to international policy formulation.",3
"Whether it is the challenge of migration, which is so affected by conflict, climate change and extreme poverty, or the many examples of conflict—many of which take place today within borders but have implications way beyond them—or the climate emergency and its impact on not only migration and displacement but development and economic prosperity, in all these areas there are elements of the absolute need for security in the prevention of conflict and the preservation of our own security at home.",2
"Of course, our development budget contributes to trying to alleviate, prevent and deal with the causes of many of these problems alongside the diplomats and those who seek to defend us In that world of such complex problems, we see a changing multilateral balance: the United States increasingly looking to its own interests rather than the global interest; Russia increasingly influential again beyond its borders; and China emerging as not just an economic superpower but a diplomatic and development superpower as well.",3
"First, while it is important in principle to integrate the work of diplomacy, development and defence, having three departments working together strategically creates more impact than the individual departments would have working alone, or that two departments would have.",3
"The case for a separate Department for International Development is well made on all kinds of grounds, but it also gives that element of this integrated approach a seat and a voice at the top table in the National Security Council and elsewhere.",3
"The case for retaining a separate Department for International Development is not just about better spending and more effective aid but a better integrated defence, diplomacy and development approach in the United Kingdom, because all three would be represented at the top table in discussions.",3
We shall see Clause 37 removes the commitment to negotiate an agreement with the EU27 on protecting child refugees.,3
"The regulations that currently provide the legal basis for child refugees to be reunited with adult relatives will end if we do not put any other negotiated agreement in place in that time Surely, there can be no right hon.",3
"Member in this place who does not respect and admire the work of our colleague and friend Lord Dubs, who, with warmth and determination, eternal optimism and good faith, has campaigned, and inspired others to campaign, for us to do more, not less, for vulnerable child refugees travelling alone and trying to get to safety.",3
"More importantly, they have reneged on a commitment to child refugees themselves, to secure arrangements at the earliest opportunity on how to protect children elsewhere in the EU who have an adult relative legally in the UK, either with status or in the asylum process Family reunion is one of those things that should not need explaining, but apparently it does: families belong together.",3
"The British Red Cross and other refugee organisations have recommended that clause 37 be removed and that the provision be restored, and the Government could do just that.",3
"The provisions end this year and I have heard no whisper of any negotiations so far with the EU about this provision, although I am happy to be corrected if the Minister knows otherwise In numerous reports, such as the House of Lords European Union Committee report “Brexit: refugee protection and asylum policy” and the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee report “Responding to irregular migration: A diplomatic route”, the importance of providing safe and legal routes to protection has been noted.",3
"They point out, for example, that policies that focus “exclusively on closing borders will drive migrants to take more dangerous routes, and push them into the hands of criminal groups.” They have warned: “In the absence of robust and accessible legal routes for seeking asylum in the UK, those with a claim are left with little choice but to make dangerous journeys by land and sea.” The Government have rightly shown concern about people setting out on those dangerous journeys, but making it harder to come by legal routes is what prompts them.",3
"The Government recognise the need—I have heard them do this—to do more to prevent desperate and vulnerable people setting out in leaky boats and taking other dangerous routes, but this recognition is hollow words if it is not followed up with the action needed to increase safe and legal routes.",3
"The Minister will know, as I have pressed on this on many occasions, in different contexts and different debates, that refugee resettlement and refugee family reunion saves lives and prevents those dangerous journeys Clause 37 is worse than I have set out, as not only does it fail to increase our response, but it goes backwards.",3
They could tell us they will replace the family reunion elements of Dublin III by prioritising negotiation with the EU and with key member states so that there is an agreement that allows individuals who have claimed asylum to be reunited with their family members.,3
"I will particularly focus today on the harm done to women who are denied access to public funds as a result of their immigration status As the law currently stands, most people who are subject to immigration control are restricted from accessing welfare benefits or housing through their council.",3
"They spoke about having no recourse to public funds and the financial burden of maintaining immigration status in the UK while on the 10-year route to settlement, and the impact that has on young people.",3
"As an all-party group, we are determined to make sure that the voices of those affected are heard in this place, whether or not the Government are willing to listen One account that sticks in my mind was from a young woman who said that her treatment, as somebody applying for citizenship in this country, has left her feeling dehumanised and unsafe.",3
That sentiment is shared by many migrant women who have no recourse to public funds.,2
"The absence of support, which is often so badly needed, is a powerful weapon of coercion in the hands of those who wish to exploit women, using the fear of imprisonment, deportation or destitution.",3
"So it is time the Government ensured that all survivors of domestic abuse, regardless of immigration status, are given full and equal access to public funds.",3
"It is appalling to see migrants shifted like cattle from Italy to Slovenia to Croatia, where alleged systemic violence and abuse by the Croatian border police eventually pushes them out of the EU into Bosnia.",3
"It is a vital national interest to work with the EU member states to ensure that migrants and asylum seekers are treated humanely, but, most of all, to address the root causes of the migration crisis.",2
"If other countries follow the UK’s example, we could see a race to the bottom in reducing development aid that will lead only to more desperate refugees on the move and more illegal migration.",3
"The Statement is as follows: “With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement about the United Kingdom’s new points-based immigration system.",4
"It will enable the UK to become a magnet for the brightest and the best, with special immigration routes for those who make the biggest contribution.",3
"We will create new arrangements for new migrants who will fill shortages in our NHS, build the companies and innovations of the future and benefit the UK for years to come.",3
"As this Government restore our status as an independent sovereign nation, we will set out our own immigration standards and controls as an open, democratic and free country The Government have listened to the clear message from the British public and are delivering what people asked for in the 2016 referendum and the December 2019 general election.",3
"That includes ending free movement through the introduction of a single global immigration system that prioritises the skills that people have to offer, not where they come from, and restoring public trust in our immigration system with a system that truly works for this country.",3
Our country and people will prosper through one system and an approach in the control of the British Government—one that will also deliver the overall reduction in low-skilled immigration that the public have asked for Many of the values that define our great country originated from the huge benefits that immigration has brought to our nation throughout its history.,3
"This is why at the heart of the new single global immigration system will be a focus on attracting talented people from around the world and on the contribution that they and their families will make, irrespective of their country of origin Last Wednesday, I published a policy statement setting out our new UK points-based immigration system, which will start operating from 1 January 2021 and work in the interests of the whole United Kingdom.",3
"The Government will ensure that talented employees from overseas, on whom our great NHS relies, can come here to work and provide high-quality, compassionate care.",3
"The new NHS visa system will provide a work visa with a fast-track decision, a larger dedicated advice service for applicants and reduced fees Like many other Members, I represent a partly rural constituency.",3
"Let me also take this opportunity to reassure the House that the immigration arrangements for members of the Armed Forces, musicians and performers are completely unchanged and these routes will operate as they do now In line with ending free movement, there will be no immigration route for lower-skilled work.",3
"These changes are vital if we are to deliver a high-skill, high-wage and highly productive economy, and, because we have provided certainty in respect of the new immigration system, the economy and businesses have had time to adjust The proposals set out in our policy statement are just the start of our phased approach to delivering a new immigration system.",3
We will continue to refine our immigration system and will build in flexibility where it is needed.,3
"Our new independence will strengthen border security, allowing us to reject insecure identity documents from newly arriving migrants.",3
I will shortly be bringing forward an immigration Bill and radically overhauling and simplifying the complex Immigration Rules that have dominated the system for decades.,3
"For the first time in decades, the UK will have control over who comes here and how our immigration system works.",3
"It is particularly poignant that we are discussing this scandal when those of a BAME back- ground, and those of a Caribbean background, are making such a major contribution, at a disproportionate cost of their own lives, in fighting the coronavirus crisis The Bill before us is extremely brief and its aim obviously worthy, but its very language—that it is providing compensation “in recognition of difficulties arising out of an inability to demonstrate … immigration status”— shows how the Home Office got into this mess in the first place.",3
"We are in this mess primarily because Home Office officials failed to recognise the rights of the Windrush generation to British citizenship, and applied the law disproportionately and insensitively in a manner that brought about the scandal.",3
"Does she accept that some people who do not have the relevant documentation, or who have a criminal record, are holding back from making claims because they retain a fear of being deported?",3
The history of immigration policy over the last 50 years has been for Governments to welcome the economic contributions made by immigrants and indigenous BAME communities but all too often to pander to intolerance and the semi-racist language of parts of our national media The hostile environment was not just a Home Office policy.,3
It was what immigrants and BAME communities faced in their daily lives.,3
I note that she has raised this amendment to probe the need to expand the UK’s refugee family reunion rules.,3
"I will address each part of the amendment in turn Paragraph (a) of the proposed new clause seeks to allow refugees to reunite with their dependent children under the age of 25, as long as they were under 18 or unmarried at the time their parents left their country.",3
"The refugee family reunion guidance is clear that where a family reunion application does not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules, caseworkers must consider whether there are any exceptional circumstances or compassionate factors that may justify a grant of leave outside the Immigration Rules.",3
I can confirm that this discretion is used to allow dependent adult children to reunite with their parents in the UK where appropriate Paragraph (b) of the proposed new clause relates to refugees sponsoring parents.,3
"Furthermore, Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules already allows refugees to sponsor adult dependent relatives living overseas to join them where, due to age, illness or disability, that person requires long-term personal care that can be provided only by relatives in the UK Paragraph (c) of the proposed new clause relates to refugees sponsoring dependent siblings under the age of 25, as long as they were under 18 or unmarried at the time their sibling left their country.",3
"This would mean extended family members who themselves do not need protection being able to come here, which risks reducing our capacity to assist the most vulnerable refugees On numbers, I highlight that the UK has now issued over 29,000 family reunion visas in only the last five years, with more than half of those issued to children—a substantial number that should not be underestimated I agree with the intention of compassion and humanity that motivates Amendment 64, proposed by my noble friend Lord Dundee.",3
"However, we do not support this amendment, which seeks to create a humanitarian visa for EEA and Swiss nationals.",3
"The UK is one of the world’s leading refugee resettlement states, resettling more refugees than any other country in Europe, and is in the top five countries worldwide.",4
"Since 2015 we have resettled more than 25,000 refugees, around half of whom have been children Once we have delivered our current commitments under the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme, we will consolidate our main schemes into a new global UK resettlement scheme.",3
"Our priority will be to continue to identify and resettle vulnerable refugees in need of protection, as identified and referred by the UNHCR.",3
"The focus of our humanitarian record is on those most in need, and I suggest that today’s amendment does not cover those most in need I turn to each proposed condition of the humanitarian visa in detail.",3
"There are several groups applying for leave to remain in the UK who are exempt from the requirement to pay the immigration health charge, including asylum claimants and victims of modern slavery who apply for discretionary leave to remain.",3
"This amendment fails to recognise the safe and legal routes in the current immigration system for reuniting families, including the previously mentioned refugee family reunion rules, as well as Part 8 and Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, all of which will remain in place at the end of the transition period The proposed amendment would also require the Government to create a new visa route for orphaned children who are EEA or Swiss nationals to come to the UK to be placed in local authority foster care where it is in their best interests.",3
"Local authorities in the UK are already facing significant pressures, currently caring for over 5,000 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, which is an increase of 146% since 2014 On the condition set out in proposed new subsection 3(c), child dependants of those with leave in the UK are very well catered for in the Immigration Rules, which means that there is no need for primary legislation to create provision that already exists Turning to Amendment 79, I appreciate the noble Baroness’s intent behind the amendment, which seeks to create a means whereby, in the future, EEA and Swiss citizens will be able to join a spouse, partner, parent or a child in the UK who is either a British citizen or holds valid leave here, but without being subject to the current and established financial requirements for family migration There are a number of additional factors that I would like to turn to, which are also reasons for objecting to this amendment.",3
"So it is true to say that the minimum income requirement is set at a suitable and consistent level and promotes financial independence, thereby avoiding burdens on the taxpayer and ensuring that families can participate sufficiently in everyday life to facilitate integration into British society.",3
"The rules also give direct effect to the Secretary of State’s statutory duty to have regard, as a primary consideration, to a child’s best interests in making an immigration decision affecting them.",3
"It is important to see this as distinct from an immigration issue alone.”—[Official Report, 7/9/20; cols.",3
It is certainly important for us to recognise the reality of internal trafficking.,2
"However, this must not be allowed to obscure the fact that by far the largest number of trafficked persons in the UK are foreign nationals, for whom immigration status is of huge importance.",3
Immigration policy will therefore be of central importance to addressing human trafficking successfully.,2
"In this context, I make no apology for my amendment Amendment 81 would require that, before making and amending the Immigration Rules to establish the system that will take the place of free movement, “under subsection 4(1) … the Secretary of State must lay a report before each House of Parliament assessing the impact of the regulations on victims of modern slavery.” In considering the importance of this provision, we should recall that when the Government announced in February their intention to replace the rights associated with free movement for EEA nationals—including EEA nationals who are victims of modern slavery—with a points-based system, the Independent Anti-slavery Commissioner, Dame Sara Thornton, responded with a warning: “traffickers will seek every opportunity to abuse new immigration policies and so the protection of vulnerable people needs to be front and centre of the debate.” The purpose of Amendment 81, which mandates that there should be an assessment of the impact of the new Immigration Rules specifically on victims of modern slavery, is to give effect to the anti-slavery commissioner’s important recommendation that the protection of vulnerable people needs to be at the front and centre of the debate One area of concern is what will happen under the new Immigration Rules to a victim of modern slavery who is not British once they have been confirmed as a victim by the national referral mechanism.",3
"Under Section 18 of Northern Ireland’s human trafficking and exploitation Act, victims are guaranteed “assistance and support” and, under subsection (9), the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland is able to continue providing support after a positive conclusive grounds decision where it deems it necessary.",3
"However, the Northern Ireland Executive have no power to grant immigration leave to victims to enable them to remain in the UK even if they deem that support necessary At the moment, many victims who are EEA nationals, including confirmed victims of modern slavery, are able to stay in Northern Ireland and the wider UK under free movement rights, thus enabling them to access regular benefits and statutory services, to work and to study, and potentially to receive additional trafficking support from our Department of Justice on a discretionary basis as they continue their recovery.",3
"However, once free movement comes to an end, EEA nationals newly arriving in the UK will no longer have the right to live and work in any part of the UK, including Northern Ireland, unless they have relevant skills and are sponsored by an employer to get a highly skilled worker visa, which is unlikely to be the case for victims of slavery.",3
"It states: “For many, having no recourse to public funds poses further barriers to moving people on safely, putting victims at risk of homelessness and destitution, and making it more likely that they will fall back into exploitation and trafficking.” Rather than responding to this key finding by extending access to recourse to public funds, it seems that we are about to remove the key provision from some victims of human trafficking that is central to victim recovery.",3
"Providing victims with secure immigration status and recourse to public funds is not simply a means to support their recovery; rather, it is also a vital measure to prevent them being retrafficked in the future The only option for a victim who arrives in the UK after 1 January to secure the right to remain in the UK and to access publicly funded benefits and services will be to apply for discretionary leave to remain, known as DLR, since EEA nationals are unlikely to be granted asylum.",3
"First, applying takes time, during which confirmed victims are vulnerable to destitution and re-trafficking.",3
"However, it absolutely does not follow that we have to create a situation in which a significant proportion of trafficking victims have uncertain immigration status and will lose recourse to public funds.",3
"As well as seeking to assess the impact of immigration rules on victims after they have escaped their exploitation, it seeks to provide an opportunity for scrutiny of how immigration rules may protect people, or inadvertently put them at risk of trafficking.",3
"A report published last year by the International Organization for Migration, Migrants and their Vulnerability to Human Trafficking, Modern Slavery and Forced Labour, found: “Restrictive immigration policies (such as restrictions applied to certain visas or arbitrary changes to asylum procedures for nationals from certain countries) and weak migration governance structures are frequently noted as major causes of vulnerability to modern slavery, especially when combined with low-wage migration.” Elsewhere, the report says that “migrants whose visas are tied to a specific employer are also at higher risk of exploitation.” Experts in labour exploitation, such as Focus on Labour Exploitation, have cautioned that temporary migration schemes are “well-recognised to increase the risks of abuse and exploitation of workers” In July the Government published a document called UK Points-Based Immigration System: Further Details Statement, which includes the following text: “As we replace freedom of movement with the Points-Based System, we remain committed to protecting individuals from modern slavery and exploitation by criminal traffickers and unscrupulous employers.” I welcome the Government’s statement, but sadly it reads as pure assertion.",3
"I very much hope that the Minister will appreciate how, in the context of the proposed removal of a route to protection from re-trafficking offered by remaining in the UK and having recourse to public funds, and without a guarantee of a safe route for migration for EEA nationals who do not qualify for the skilled worker scheme, this assertion, divorced from any delivery mechanism, is vulnerable to seeming profoundly disingenuous.",3
During our consideration of the Bill we have heard a great deal about the impact of the shape of immigration rules on confirmed victims of modern slavery.,3
"I share the concerns articulated by other noble Lords about not permitting the changes to the immigration system to leave victims with fewer rights to remain, or more restricted access to services and support than is currently available This country has a proud history of providing asylum, refuge and protection to vulnerable people, and ending freedom of movement is not meant to pull the rug out from underneath vulnerable victims of modern slavery.",3
Some 15% of the agriculture businesses surveyed employ seasonal migrant workers.,3
"Agriculture is, unfortunately, already well known to be a risk sector for human trafficking, and the combination of a change to the rules around recruiting migrant workers with those existing risks cannot be ignored A report published by the International Organization for Migration last year, Migrants and their Vulnerability to Human Trafficking, Modern Slavery and Forced Labour, found that: “Restrictive immigration policies (such as restrictions applied to certain visas or arbitrary changes to asylum procedures for nationals from certain countries) and weak migration governance structures are frequently noted as major causes of vulnerability to modern slavery, especially when combined with low-wage migration”, and that, “migrants whose visas are tied to a specific employer are also at higher risk of exploitation” In this context, it comes as no surprise to me that the noble Lord, Lord Morrow, who has huge experience in dealing with modern slavery issues, having developed, introduced and successfully taken through Stormont what is now known as the human trafficking and exploitation Act, has brought forward the amendment to provide the requisite delivery mechanism.",3
Three tests must be met when a democracy considers the development of a robust immigration system that serves both its own citizens and those seeking to make the UK their new home.,3
"Next, does it provide equity for those applying to work here, so that it is their skill set, not their passport, that determine eligibility?",3
"Finally, does it provide genuine asylum for vulnerable and displaced people, not only expressing Britain’s humanitarian commitments but reflecting the values of the British people The amendment, through the introduction of the tier 2 displaced talent visa stream, responds to all three of those questions affirmatively.",3
"This means that, after focusing on the development of UK workers, employers may still need to look overseas for suitable talent, where shortages exist This is particularly true of, say, the health and education sectors.",3
This is just one example of the many sectors that would greatly benefit from the creation of a new displaced talent visa The second test is the equity test.,3
"The Government have been right to champion a points-based immigration agenda, with a focus on equity for applicants, by seeking out people’s skills set not their passport.",3
"These include, as we have heard, the payment of substantial government fees, charges, difficulties in securing official travel documents, and an inability to evidence English language competence According to Talent Beyond Boundaries, it can take over six months for a displaced person to access an English language test when applying for asylum from Lebanon.",3
"The amendment is not intended to replace our UN commitments to refugee settlement, but rather to answer the call of employers who are willing to support vulnerable people, while closing their own labour and skills gaps.",3
"My Lords, I begin with the so-called displaced talent visa—asylum seekers embody displaced talent in many cases but, as the right reverend Prelate says, refugees often demonstrate great talent.",3
When people see the benefits of immigration the contribution to social cohesion is very considerable.,2
Again I am glad that he reminded the Committee of that because it is too often regarded as work rather than volunteering and reduces the possibilities of asylum seekers whose claims have not been determined to undertake activity which so often they are keen to do.,3
The narrative that we hear too often is that most refugees in France try to cross the channel to the UK.,3
"Whatever the reasons for its delay, can we look forward to when we might receive it Along with my comments about crossing the channel, I should have said that to talk about unfounded claims is rather close to talking about illegal asylum seekers.",3
Asylum seekers are not illegal until their claim has been determined.,3
"These probing amendments are about citizenship, and I am grateful to the Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens—of which I am a patron—and Amnesty International UK for their help with them.",3
"I pay tribute to these organisations for all the work they have done to promote and protect children’s citizenship rights For technical reasons, the amendments relate solely to EEA and Swiss nationals, but the issues they raise echo concerns raised previously on a number of occasions in your Lordships’ House, particularly with regard to children’s citizenship rights.",3
"A combination of factors, including exorbitant fees, lack of awareness of the need to register their right to citizenship and the difficulties faced by local authorities in assisting looked-after children to exercise the right, have resulted in thousands of children being denied that right to British citizenship One consequence of our leaving the EU is that many more children could be in this position.",3
"In establishing the EUSS, it has done nothing to raise awareness of their citizenship rights or to encourage children and young people with these rights to exercise them.",3
"Instead, because the EUSS is free, there is a real danger that many of them will be encouraged to secure themselves immigration status and not confirm or register themselves as British citizens, which they may not realise is open to them and involves a fee of £1,012 In a High Court judgment in December last year—mentioned in the debate on an earlier amendment—that fee was deemed unlawful, as it was set without having regard to the best interests of the child.",3
"In particular, it underlined the importance of citizenship In response to a similar set of amendments in the Commons Committee stage, the Immigration Minister argued that any child looked after by their local authority can apply for limited and indefinite leave to remain without having to pay a fee, and that citizenship itself “is not essential for any individual to work, live, study or access services in the UK.” When he was urged not to pursue that line of argument by Stuart McDonald MP, he re-emphasised that citizenship “is not something that people need in order to access services.”—[Official Report, Commons, Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill Committee, 16/6/20; cols.",3
Does the Conservative Party really believe in such a transactional view of the significance of citizenship?,3
"In contrast, in 1981, during the passage of the British Nationality Act, which conferred the right to register as a citizen, it was emphasised that this was in part to ensure that the children concerned should have “as strong a sense of security as possible” Citizenship is about security, belonging, inclusion, integration and identity.",3
"Apart from allowing a child to apply for a British citizen passport, British citizenship gives them the opportunity to participate more fully in the life of their local community as they grow up.” As noted on the earlier amendment, the High Court judgment referred to a “mass of evidence” that the inability to exercise their right to register as citizens because of the fee causes many children born in the UK to “feel alienated, excluded, isolated, second best, insecure and not fully assimilated into the culture and social fabric of the UK.” Is this really what the Government want?",3
This false equation of immigration status with citizenship was one factor in the Windrush scandal.,3
"The Home Office’s argument that such a mark-up on the fee is justified because it provides a “benefit” and because the Home Office needs the money to run a sustainable immigration and citizenship system—repeated by the Minister at Second Reading—is specious because we are talking about a citizenship right bestowed by Parliament, not a discretionary immigration status Amendment 68 also excludes from the fee any child who has been looked after by a local authority—a particularly marginalised group of children.",3
"However, as I am sure the Minister realises, the more general question of the barriers to registering the right to British citizenship, particularly the level of the fee, is one that we will return to in this House time and again.",3
"In recent months, the UK has seen a completely unacceptable increase in illegal migration through small-boat crossings from France to the UK.",3
Every Government over the last 20 years and more have experienced migrants—often economic migrants—attempting to reach the UK through illegal means.,3
The majority of these crossings are facilitated by ruthless criminal gangs that make money from exploiting migrants who are desperate to come here We are working with the National Crime Agency to go after those who profit from such misery.,3
"Already this year, 24 people have been convicted and jailed for facilitating illegal immigration.",3
"In July, I joined a dawn raid on addresses across London, which saw a further 11 people arrested for facilitating illegal immigration, and £150,000 in cash and some luxury cars were seized.",3
"Just this morning, we arrested a man under section 25 of the Immigration Act 1971 who had yesterday illegally piloted a boat into this country.",3
"This morning, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution has been out in the English channel and has had to rescue at least 34 people, and possibly more, who were attempting this dangerous journey These criminally facilitated journeys are not just dangerous; they are unnecessary as well.",3
"France, where these boats are launched, and other EU countries through which these migrants have travelled on their way to the channel, are manifestly safe countries with fully functioning asylum systems.",4
Genuine refugees seeking only safety can and should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.,3
There is no excuse to refuse to do so and instead travel illegally and dangerously to the UK.,4
Those fleeing persecution have had many opportunities to claim asylum in the European countries they have passed through long before attempting this crossing We are working closely with our French colleagues to prevent these crossings.,3
"If this route is completely ended, migrants wishing to come to the UK will no longer need to travel to northern France in the first place.",3
"We have already in the last two months established a joint intelligence cell to ensure that intelligence about crossings is rapidly acted upon, and this morning’s interceptions on French soil are evidence of the success of that approach It is also essential to return people who make the crossings where we can, and we are currently working to return nearly 1,000 cases where migrants had previously claimed asylum in European countries and, under the regulations, legally should be returned there.",3
"Friend the Minister and the Home Secretary to be candid about the level of anger and frustration felt by many of my constituents in Mansfield and people across the UK at stories that we hear about illegal migrants arriving on our shores, being put up in hotels and having endless legal challenges funded at the expense of British taxpayers.",3
"The Minister is right that we need to stop the boats leaving France in the first place, stop this criminal activity and prevent people from putting their lives at risk in this way, but what can we do here at home to ensure that our domestic system for asylum and deportation is seen to be working for British taxpayers?",3
"Where people have a genuine fear of persecution, where they are fleeing to our shores and need our protection, or where we encounter them directly in dangerous areas, we are of course prepared to offer protection, as we did via the resettlement scheme, but that in no way removes, dilutes or diminishes our obligation and determination to protect our borders from illegal immigration.",3
"This Parliament and this country will decide who comes here, not ruthless people smugglers, and I call on the hon.",3
Member and the whole Labour party to assist us and work with us in protecting and defending our country’s borders.,3
"The closing of borders in many African countries not only means that it is very difficult to get humanitarian aid to refugee camps, where people are living in conditions of overcrowding and poor sanitation; it also means that tens of thousands of migrants are trapped at the borders, sometimes having been abandoned there by people smugglers, or stuck in transit camps.",2
"Since last year, I have been working with Restore Glasgow, as well as local authority colleagues, to explore different ways of ensuring greater regulation and licensing of nail bars and car washes, which we know, sadly, are often used for the purposes of human trafficking.",3
"One way or another, we must all do more to tackle the scourge of trafficking.",2
"More often than not, we might think that we are getting a bargain by getting our nails done—well, perhaps not in my case—or a car washed for £2 or £3, but we have to wonder who is really paying the price The internationalism and compassion shown by the people of Glasgow East does not just stop at human trafficking.",3
"To get that ambitious deal for our oceans and our climate needs, we need senior politicians in the negotiating room who can push for a strong treaty, so I implore the Prime Minister to send a senior Minister to New York in the next couple of months for the final round of the global ocean treaty negotiations, and to really take this opportunity to leave a better world for our future generations Our responsibilities to future generations also extend to child refugees and family reunion.",3
"When Lord Dubs’ amendment came to the Commons from the other place last month during the passage of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, I was very proud to vote in favour of it, because child refugees with family members here in the UK should not be stuck in camps and car parks alone.",3
"We know that when safe and legal routes are not accessible, children are more likely to make more dangerous journeys and to be pushed into the hands of people smugglers.",2
"If global Britain is to be anything more than a slogan, the Government really need to act with compassion on child refugee family reunion policy I turn to domestic policy and matters specifically impacting on my Glasgow East constituency.",3
"We are absolutely united in our message to London, Brussels and Washington that these tariffs must end in order to protect jobs on both sides of the Atlantic Sticking with an overseas theme, I want to turn now to the persecution of Christians, a subject that is close to my heart.",3
"The Government will set out the terms of reference for the royal commission in due course, which will include details on the scope, duration and membership of the commission After Brexit, United Kingdom businesses, individuals and families will still need to be able to settle cross-border disputes.",3
"Without these agreements, people involved in cross-border disputes will find it more difficult to resolve them.",3
"This Bill will give United Kingdom businesses, citizens and families the confidence to work, live and trade across borders, and will help the UK to flourish as a trading nation, as we leave the European Union Following our exit from the European Union, the government will bring an end to free movement to ensure that the UK can take back control and introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system that prioritises people’s skills and contributions to the UK.",3
The provision will see people who are wanted for a serious crime in a country such as Canada or America and who may be a danger to the public brought before a judge within 24 hours to allow extradition proceedings to commence and thus make the streets of the UK safer The Government are working hard to improve the efficient and effective removal of foreign national offenders from the UK.,3
"However, tougher action is needed to stop abuse of the system, speed up the process for deporting foreign national offenders and deter foreign criminals from coming to the UK.",3
"That is why the Government will significantly increase the maximum penalty for those who return to the UK in breach of a deportation order, sending a clear message to criminals who seek to return to the UK, namely: if you try to return, you will go to prison for a long time.",3
"We want a nation that works with others to settle cross-border disputes, values immigration but prioritises the skills it needs and rejects foreign criminals from our shores swiftly and decisively, where state agencies work together to address serious violence tou keep our young people safe from harm.",3
"For instance, how do we take back control when we have climate change turning parts of Africa into extended deserts and a mass movement of immigrant people looking for some way of sustaining their life?",2
"We accept many refugees from that region, but we never know how many we will have to take.",3
"How do we take control I was here when David Cameron made the promise that, by the year 2020, we would have accepted 20,000 refugees from Syria.",3
"First, we can change our whole immigration ethos.",2
Why do we welcome immigrants to this country yet not allow them to work until they have been here for 12 months?,3
Why do we still allow a Home Office that has 47% of its immigration decisions overturned on appeal?,3
"We know there are problems, but we are here, and we can contribute so much to the life of the United Kingdom.” We heard in the House yesterday of the shortage of nurses, yet we have nurses—thousands of them, I imagine —in the immigration procedure.",3
"We had brought hope instead of despair—I could go on, but I must not—as with so many of the lads and lasses from overseas who come here In this new term, will the Government now give us hope and respond to those needs that we have debated over the years, so that so many people will be able to say, “Yes, this is the best day of my life”?",3
"These are very different approaches to policy-making: imposition or development in consultation with the people affected I want to talk about immigration, which is so important to our society and our economy.",3
"Of course, the Migration Advisory Committee is yet to publish its advice on this, but I have forgotten how much immigration law is created by ministerial fiat, through rules which do not even get the scarce scrutiny of secondary legislation.",3
"Things look very different when you have an informed or personal take on them, as we were reminded by recent reports of Her Majesty’s concerns about visas for polo events.",3
These things are not straightforward and they are not uniform across all the nations and regions of the UK I have been told that Australia has 90 different visas.,4
Am I being unnecessarily gloomy in thinking that having visas with different restrictions attached to each application will make the whole process a challenge for the Home Office?,3
"It defies credibility that 40% of those who have applied for settled status are entitled only to pre-settled status, which is what 40% have been granted Having been critical, I will say that I was glad to see an announcement before the election about the length of post-study visas and to see that there will be a boost for English language teaching.",3
"This will be for “existing migrants”, so who qualifies Refugees are generally very keen to learn English.",3
"I want to say a word about refugees and asylum seekers, adults and children, families and lone young people, because so much of the election seemed to focus on little England.",3
I was also trying to envisage what getting into the North Sea on New Year’s Day must have been like.,3
"The Youth Justice Board total funding for front-line services, including youth offending teams, is £72.2 million, and we continue to support residential areas to provide an environment where young people feel able to engage with integrated care, health and education services in order to progress during their time in custody The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, talked about exclusion and early intervention.",3
"We will of course ensure that the appropriate funding is there to meet the new duty The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, asked whether economic integration on the island of Ireland will lead to political integration.",3
"It remains firmly the Secretary of State’s view that a clear majority in Northern Ireland continues to support the current settlement, as my noble friend Lord Caine pointed out, and that the circumstances for a border poll are not satisfied.",3
"We have committed to increasing investment in policing by £750 million next year to support the unprecedented commitment to recruit an additional 6,000 officers by March 2021, and details of the allocation of funding will be set out very shortly in the police funding Statement Other questions were put to me on immigration but I have been speaking for 20 minutes and I am aware that another debate is happening next.",3
"Last Friday, I met my constituent Sally Wainwright to hear about her experiences as a volunteer helping refugees and migrants on the Greek islands.",3
"As tensions have risen, mobs have attacked press and aid workers, refugee facilities have been set on fire and non-governmental organisations have had to pull out It is clear that the 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey is breaking down.",3
"Last week, Turkey decided to open its borders with Greece, and it even bussed migrants close to the north-western border.",3
We have seen the troubling pictures of hundreds of refugees or migrants attempting to land small boats on the Greek islands.,3
Tens of thousands of people have headed for the land border and become trapped between Turkey and Greece.,3
"Greece has halted all asylum claims for a month and sent riot police and border guards to turn people back, to deter them from entering the country.",3
"Aggressive measures have been employed, and we have seen migrants stripped naked and beaten before being sent back across the border.",3
"We have had reports of a refugee being shot dead by live ammunition and of a child dying at sea Yesterday, as the Minister said, President Erdoğan visited Brussels for talks, and there have been reports that the EU is considering taking up to 1,500 child refugees from the Greek islands to ease the pressure on the overwhelmed camps.",3
My constituent tells me that hundreds of those child refugees are unaccompanied.,3
"First, can he tell us what the UK is going to do to ease the plight of child refugees, particularly the unaccompanied ones, on the Greek islands?",3
"Secondly, what representations have the UK Government made to Greece and Turkey to end the human rights abuses that have been reported and to ensure that Greece follows the rule of law in relation to asylum applications?",3
"Its intention is, first, to continue to provide incentives for registration but to avoid making EU citizens who do not register by the deadline immediately and by definition illegal.",3
"They will be deemed to be unlawfully in the United Kingdom whether or not they are otherwise eligible for permanent residence under the scheme, and they will therefore be subject to deportation I echo the comments of my noble friend and others: the Home Office is clearly making strenuous efforts in this regard.",4
"It is a bizarre form of protection Another issue with the settled status scheme is that, unlike the indefinite leave to remain scheme, where you have a stamp in your passport, it does not provide successful applicants with physical proof of their right to be in the United Kingdom.",3
"Instead, they must rely entirely on a code issued to them by the Home Office, which has to be entered into the relevant website by whoever requires proof of their immigration status.",3
"Interactions with landlords, airline staff and other officials obliged to check immigration status will become fraught with anxiety and will be dependent on the fragility of an internet connection or the resilience of a government IT system Finally, and most fundamentally, the current settled status scheme rests on immigration regulations, which can be changed virtually at the stroke of a ministerial pen, and on the undertakings of Ministers.",3
"The reality, though, is somewhat different, as those of us who have regular daily experiences with the immigration system on behalf of our constituents, and who have seen the many pieces of evidence that we took on the Home Affairs Committee, recognise.",3
"It was an extraordinary situation, which the then Home Secretary had to explain One has only to look at the regular monthly statistics from the Home Office to see the number of cases of wrongful deportations and wrongful detentions as a result of the hostile environment policy and as a result of mistakes and problems.",3
We have our birth certificates and passports—physical documents for the most crucial aspects of our rights and citizenship rights in this country.,3
"Anyone who deals with the immigration system on a weekly basis, as many of us do, can point to myriad examples There is also the crucial issue of numbers, which the hon.",3
"We do not want to see the unlawful detentions and deportations of individuals that we have sadly seen in the past, nor the harm they cause to the individuals whose rights are affected This issue goes back to some fundamental promises that were made—not only by the current Prime Minister, but by the previous Prime Minister and by those who advocated leaving in the first place.",3
"I am aware the term used now by the Government is “compliant environment”, but I am concerned with the substance not the terminology We have turned citizens, our public services and the police into border guards.",3
We have dumped on them the enforcement of immigration control.,3
"People are deterred from seeking medical treatment for fear of a large bill or being reported, detained or deported.",2
Landlords are required to check the immigration status of potential tenants and face huge fines or imprisonment if they fail to check or get it wrong.,3
Can it be any surprise that many landlords take the easy course and look for tenants who are British passport holders?,3
"It is—though without any real sanction The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, whose action against the Home Office continues, says on its website: “It takes BME people and migrants up to twice as long to find a home to rent as a white British person.” Recently, the organisation the3million commissioned a poll of employers in connection with its campaign for physical documentary proof of EU settled status; we will come to that shortly.",3
"This affects EEA and Swiss citizens in the immediate short term, but the Government aim to roll out the digital-only status to an ever-expanding group of immigrants The poll’s findings included the fact that employers are very concerned about the consequences of getting it wrong.",3
"He talked about the large number of people who “had never bothered applying for passports, while the Home Office had lost their papers” and then discovered that they were “technically undocumented”.",3
"One young woman who found herself in that situation was precluded from attending university, for which she had qualified, and is behind a report showing how lives are “distorted and damaged”—her words—by a “callous bureaucratic system that sows division, hurts mental health and condemns families to more than a decade of massive financial strain … Talk to these young adults and you hear tales of life on the edge as they are pitched into a Kafkaesque process that is complex, intrusive, often incompetent, demands huge and constantly rising fees”— the fees are no little part of the picture— “yet make one mistake and, like a dystopian game of snakes and ladders, applicants slide back down to start the torturous … process to citizenship again.” I will discipline myself and not quote further from the article, but it ends by saying that “the horrors of the hostile environment have not faded” The Government talk of welcoming people from the EEA making a home here within the Immigration Rules, but the application of the hostile or compliant environment legislation does not say, “Welcome to the UK.” I beg to move.",3
"First, I must declare my interest, as in the register, as being a vice-chairman of the Human Trafficking Foundation Having been the local MP, I know that the London of Borough of Hillingdon received and looked after a large number of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.",3
"A member of my Conservative association was—shall we say?—very forthright on the immigration policies at that time and was not a fan of lots of people coming in, as he saw it, illegally, legally or whatever, to the point where sometimes I really winced when I heard him speak.",3
"However, there was a knock at my window late one night—I lived, and still do live, in the heart of my constituency—and it was this gentleman, who said, “John, you’ve got to do something.” Apparently, he had had a bad road accident and the only person who had come to his aid as he was lying on the road was a young Kosovan, who was going to be deported.",3
"I am not sure about some of the wording in the amendment—although I am not an expert on it—but I think that we should take this issue very seriously at this particular time A couple of years ago, I was at the main railway station in Serbia and saw the flow of migrants, although by that time it was not as large as it had been.",3
"Surely it is hypocritical to wring one’s hands over children and young people risking their lives to cross the channel in tiny boats while increasing the likelihood of that happening in future by further narrowing clear and firm legal routes open to them, as has already been stated.",3
"The Government have already deemed it “practical and safe” to restart some deportation flights, so why not resettlement flights?",3
"Flights that would offer a literal lifeline to some of the most vulnerable refugees in the world.” He underlined that it is “a matter of urgency.” Urgent too, as we have heard from a number of noble Lords, is action to help those children whose lives have been turned upside down yet again by the dreadful fire at the Moria camp in Lesbos.",3
"Why have we not yet done what we should be doing here Returning to the Bill itself, Coram has bemoaned the lack of attention given to children generally in the Government’s immigration proposals.",3
"For EU nationals living here—many of whom are our family members, friends and colleagues—and for UK citizens living in EU member states, the changes will also be profound, bringing a potential loss of security and life choices in the future The aim of the Government’s Brexit project of ending free movement to and from the EU and replacing it with the future global points-based immigration system was supposedly to deliver on their aim of reducing net migration.",3
"Is this what “taking back control” was supposed to be about Those EU nationals who for whatever reason do not acquire settled status by the deadline of the end of June 2021 will move from an immigration system that currently works to the same unreformed system that currently applies to non-EU nationals, which is inhumane, dysfunctional and, frankly, chaotic.",3
"Even those who succeed in registering under the EU settled status scheme will receive no physical documentation as proof of their status; their rights will not be guaranteed in primary legislation and will potentially be subject to alteration by Ministers under the very considerable Henry VIII powers that this Bill bestows on them The Financial Times reported in July that the number of EU migrants who have applied for the right to stay in the UK after Brexit already considerably exceeds official estimates of the Europeans who are eligible to remain, raising further questions over the effectiveness of the Government’s scheme.",3
"However, it is likely that tens of thousands will suddenly become unlawfully resident in the country that they have legally made their own and be left facing the full force of the Home Office’s “hostile environment”—namely, criminalisation and the threat of deportation The groups most affected are likely to include many from the age groups under 18 years and over 65 years, who have had worryingly low application rates.",3
"It is another Windrush in the making The other main impact of the Bill is of course that, as a direct consequence of the abolition of EEA free movement for UK citizens, we, our children and our grandchildren will from January 2021 lose our rights to live, work and study in the 27 member states of the EU plus the three EEA countries and Switzerland—the biggest diminution in value of a country’s citizenship in history.",3
"It is sent in the form of a letter, by post, or a PDF, by email, and sets out their immigration status in the UK.",3
"We are developing an immigration system whereby all migrants can demonstrate their immigration status via an online service, which they can access securely via the view and prove service on GOV.UK.",3
"Where there is a checked status, written confirmation must not be accepted by third parties as evidence of immigration status We are also developing services to make the relevant immigration status information available automatically through system-to-system checks at the point at which the person seeks access to public services such as healthcare and benefits.",3
We will require EEA citizens to use their online evidence of immigration status only after 30 June 2021.,3
"It will include guidance on those who care for vulnerable users and on use by a range of stakeholders working with local groups, including vulnerable groups The full package of measures that I have described will be available before EEA passports and national identity cards cease to be valid for proving rights in the UK after 30 June next year.",3
"In answer to the point on two systems that was made by the noble Lords, Lord Oates and Lord Paddick, we will replace physical and paper-based evidence of status with digital products for all migrants, starting with EEA citizens, in the next few years.",3
"At the same time, we are developing an extensive package of communications to ensure that everyone, from individuals to employers, landlords and other third parties, is fully aware of the move to digital and how online immigration status can be accessed and used Right-to-rent and right-to-work checks are not new.",3
That is 13 years since they were introduced—14 by the time that online evidence of immigration is mandatory in June 2021—albeit they will now be in an online format.,3
"The UK public has learned to access many government services online, from applying for a UK passport to paying their vehicle excise duty.",3
"UK driving licence holders are able to share online with third parties, such as car rental companies, whether they have driving-related convictions Employers are able to conduct right-to-work checks on foreign national employees remotely, without the need for physical documents to be handed over.",3
"Holders of biometric residence cards or biometric residence permits have already been able to prove their right to work to an employer by using an online service, instead of using their card, since January last year—the first step in our journey to make evidence of immigration status accessible online.",3
"In the last reporting period, from April to June this year, there have been over 400,000 views on the service by migrants.",3
Most visa applications are made online.,3
"Providing immigration status information online has enabled us to simplify and standardise the system of checks for employers, by providing information about an individual’s status in a format that is easy to understand and accessible to all users, removing the need for employers and others to interpret myriad physical documents, complex legal terminology or confusing abbreviations The EU settlement scheme has been at the forefront of the transition from biometric residence cards to secure online access to immigration status information.",3
The online system is operating in parallel with existing document checks of passports or identity documents.,3
"Ultimately, all migrants coming to the UK, whether from other European countries or the rest of the world, will have access to online services which will enable them to show their immigration status without needing a document or biometric card On resilience, digital services are designed to be highly resilient, with rigorous testing to build assurance before services are seen by a user.",3
"Multiple security controls are in place to protect against cyberattacks and we have employed third-party organisations to conduct vulnerability and penetration testing to provide additional assurance that our online services cannot be compromised I shall not detain the House much further, other than to say that we will always send a formal written notification of the individual’s immigration status by email, in the form of a printable PDF document, or by post where a paper application has been made.",3
I reiterate that this Government share the noble Lord’s sincere concerns about refugee and asylum-seeking children.,3
"It was Kristallnacht that effectively gave birth to the Kindertransport scheme, which enabled 10,000 refugee children to come to the UK in the 1930s, including the noble Lord, Lord Dubs.",3
"I am of course extremely proud of what the UK did then and continue to be proud of what we are doing now and our record in government The UK continues to be one of the highest recipients of asylum claims from unaccompanied children across Europe, receiving more claims than any EU member state in 2019 and 20% of all claims made in the EU and the UK.",4
"Instead, unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in Europe with family members in the UK will be able to apply to join eligible sponsors, such as those with refugee leave or who are beneficiaries of humanitarian protection, those with British citizenship or those with settled status under the Immigration Rules.",3
"I want to reassure noble Lords about what our existing rules do and the opportunities they provide for children to reunite with their families The rules already make provision for a child to be reunited with a parent in the UK, either under the refugee family reunion rules or via Appendix FM, depending on the immigration status of the parent.",3
"For example, an uncle or aunt with refugee status or British citizenship, or who is settled in the UK, could sponsor a nephew or niece to join them here where those basic requirements are met It is important to say that these rules are global; it could be a child coming from Syria, Lebanon, France or Greece.",4
"Noble Lords may also wish to note that the vast majority of unaccompanied children who came to join family members under Dublin in 2019 joined British citizens, refugees or those granted humanitarian protection, or settled persons Following our departure from the Dublin regulation, I expect to see a greater number of applications for unaccompanied children to reunite with family members in the UK under our existing rules.",3
"It is also right that our rules examine, for example, whether a child can be accommodated in a home that does not breach housing laws However, unlike Dublin, which simply provides for their transfer to the UK to have their asylum claim processed here, our rules grant children a form of leave—that distinction is very important.",3
"A child granted leave under family reunion rules will also immediately be provided with a route to settlement, or may even be granted settlement on arrival, depending on the immigration status of the sponsor.",3
"Under the refugee family reunion rules alone, we issued over 29,000 refugee family reunion visas in the last five years, and around half of these were for children.",3
"This includes 6,320 visas issued in the year ending June of this year.",3
"That is over 10 times the number of all family reunion transfers under the Dublin regulation in 2019 Importantly, there is also discretion for immigration caseworkers to grant leave to enter outside of the Immigration Rules, where a refusal under the rules would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences, or on the basis of Article 8 of the ECHR, on family life.",3
"The amendment commits to: a review of legal routes to the UK, including for family reunion of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children; a public consultation on those legal routes for family reunion for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children; laying a statement providing further detail of this review and consultation before Parliament within three months of the immigration Bill achieving Royal Assent; preparing a report on the outcome of the review, and to publishing and laying that report before Parliament.",3
"This is in line with our new, global approach to the future immigration system.",3
"Noble Lords will remember that I have already committed on the Floor of this House that the UK will pursue bilateral negotiations with key countries of mutual interest on post-transition migration issues, which will include family reunion for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children I trust that noble Lords will agree that the Government’s Amendments 4C, 4D and 4E—agreed in the other place—in addition to my commitment on bilateral discussions, are a generous package of commitments providing for a full consideration of our future approach to safe and legal routes as part of our new global immigration system, including on family reunion for these children.",3
"It clearly demonstrates how seriously this Government take the issue of family unity for vulnerable children and recognise the importance of these routes, to discourage vulnerable children from making dangerous and illegal journeys that can result in the kind of tragedy that we saw last week Amendment 4B, and Motion A1 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, would also require the Government to replicate the Dublin routes for adults and families to join family members in the UK.",3
"I beg to move, That this House is deeply concerned by the ongoing humanitarian crisis facing refugees across the globe; has considered the secondary effects of the covid-19 pandemic on refugees and displaced persons in fragile or low-income states; and calls on the Government to provide urgent support to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries and communities as they deal with the covid-19 pandemic I am incredibly grateful to the Backbench Business Committee for allocating time for this important debate, to its co-sponsor my hon.",3
"We breathe the same air, drink the same water and enjoy a shared humanity that transcends borders.",3
"In that spirit, this debate addresses the plight of the world’s refugees in the face of coronavirus, and calls on the Government to do more to help This is not just a crisis across Asia, Africa and the middle east; it also affects Europe and the UK, as we have seen desperate people make perilous voyages across the English channel this summer and the terrible tragedy of refugees drowning at sea.",3
"These are desperate people exploited by criminal gangs and failed utterly by the international community As the MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, I can claim some connection to the word “refugee”.",3
"It was originally coined by the French Huguenots fleeing religious persecution after 1685, many of whom came to Spitalfields in my constituency and left their mark on the east end’s streets, architecture and heritage The east end was home to many thousands of Jewish refugees in the 1880s.",3
"Jewish refugees from Portugal gave us fish and chips, and much else, of course.",3
"We owe him a huge debt of gratitude for all that he has done, and continues to do, to fight for refugee children.",3
"It is a great shame that our Government have not taken up his powerful case for our hosting refugee children We have accepted refugees who have fled civil war and conflict in many parts of the world, including the Ugandan Asians expelled by Idi Amin, and people from eastern Europe, Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia and Iraq.",3
"There have always been bigots putting up barriers, and blaming and stigmatising refugees, but they have thankfully been in a minority.",2
"The UK can be proud of welcoming refugees, and of its global contribution to protecting them, for example through the role that Clement Atlee and Ernest Bevin played in the 1950s in founding the United Nations and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.",4
"I know the Minister will say that it is business as usual, despite the merger of DFID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; I hope so, when it comes to protecting the poorest in the world, who need our support Today, the refugee crisis is on a scale that none of us could have foreseen.",3
"Among them, nearly 26 million are classed as refugees, over half of whom are under the age of 18.",3
"Millions of stateless people have been denied nationality and citizenship; access to basic rights, such as education, healthcare, and employment; and freedom of movement.",2
Life expectancy is incredibly low and infectious disease is widespread in them—and this is before we take into account the impact of coronavirus Over half of those affected by the Syrian refugee crisis have been displaced into refugee settlements.,2
"There are camps in Chad housing Sudanese refugees; camps on the Tunisian-Libyan border; the Kakuma camp in Kenya, one of the largest in the world; and camps in Iraqi Kurdistan, Jordan and Yemen.",3
"Of course, millions of Syrian refugees are being hosted by Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and many other countries.",4
"Many have argued, including the president of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, that the camps should be closed down, with refugees being allowed to integrate into communities and to work.",3
"We also need to do more to enable the right of return for refugees, which means that much more action is required of the international community to look at ways of dealing with the root causes of the conflicts that have often led to people being forced out of countries—whether it be Syria, Myanmar or elsewhere The tragedy is that the huge financial commitment required to host the sudden influx of refugees is placed on the shoulders of the countries that are least able to afford it.",3
"Eighty four per cent of the world’s refugees are living in developing countries, and seven out of the top 10 developing countries hosting refugees are considered fragile states in the OECD’s fragility framework Although many countries suspended their refugee resettlement schemes due to the coronavirus pandemic, many of them have now resumed, but not here in the UK.",3
"The Government have also cruelly voted down the Dubs amendment, which would have guaranteed family reunion rights for child refugees after our withdrawal from the EU.",3
"If there is one way to pay tribute to the courage and determination of Lord Dubs, who was a child refugee himself, this would be the way to do it, and I hope the Minister will take that on.",3
"The UK has accepted only a small number of refugees and asylum seekers, amounting to about 0.25% of the UK’s total population.",3
"Let us compare that with what some of the poorest countries are doing in hosting hundreds of thousands, if not more than a million, refugees This year, on top of all the problems facing refugees, we have seen the impact of the pandemic.",3
"We know also that the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, which is one of the biggest in Europe, desperately needs assistance.",3
"CAFOD is warning about the Syrian refugee camps in Lebanon, saying that the concern for the large refugee populations is that social distancing, self-isolation and frequent handwashing are nearly impossible in the communities in which they live.",3
"This problem is widespread—whether we look at Syria, Lebanon, Bangladesh or elsewhere From the Greek islands to Gaza and from Bangladesh to Botswana, the pandemic is set to sweep through the world’s refugee camps, and we need to do more.",2
"Our call was for the UK Government to support the UN’s $2 billion global humanitarian response to covid, to scale up the public health response, to support refugees who need help, to deliver personal protective equipment, to work with international partners, the World Bank and the IMF to cope with the impact of covid in middle income countries, and, of course, to support the UN General-Secretary’s call for a global ceasefire, including any UN Security Council resolution for a global ceasefire, to de-escalate conflicts in many of the parts of the world that are giving rise to the forced displacement of people The Government have gone some way to provide humanitarian assistance, but we call on the Government to do more on this particular agenda—on ending conflicts, holding to account certain Governments who are not doing enough, and also working with the international community to provide the much-needed funding For many years, I have campaigned with colleagues from across the House on the Rohingya crisis, so I want to focus my final remarks on the plight of the Rohingya people who have faced, as I said earlier, incomprehensible atrocities, killings, torture, executions, mass deportations, the razing of villages, and women and girls enduring gang rape and other forms of horrific sexual violence.",3
"I heard their testimonies at first hand when I went to Rakhine state in 2013 and then in 2017 and then to Cox’s Bazar, which hosts a million refugees from Myanmar who have been persecuted We have just recently marked the third anniversary of hundreds of thousands of people fleeing to Bangladesh to escape the genocide, but the genocidal violence against the Rohingya in the summer of 2017 did not come out of the blue.",3
"It came from a combination of decades of persecution, systematic discrimination and the denial of citizenship and basic human rights.",2
"That is why it is so important that our Government support that move In terms of what we do next and how we provide support to those who desperately need it, I draw attention to the calls by former Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who has said of the refugee crisis: “This is not a problem in far-off lands that rich countries can ignore” There is growing demand that the Governments of the developed world, including our own, shoulder more of the responsibility.",3
"We need to act to try to ensure that there is a proper global health and economic recovery plan for those countries, because that is what will stem the rise in conflict, the increase in refugees and people being forced out of their homes, and it will help to reduce conflict We need to double funding to the World Bank for emergency aid.",3
"We need to provide more support to the International Monetary Fund to help those countries, so that they do not end up being desperate and the economic troubles do not cause further conflict and division, thereby causing more people to suffer and end up as refugees.",2
"We also need to do more to tackle climate change, which will create more refugees.",2
"In Bangladesh, 30 million people are likely to become climate refugees, so there is a great deal that we need to do going forward I hope our Government will take a stronger role in the international arena.",3
"If we do not, those refugees out of desperation will want to flee and come to the shores of Europe, and we have seen the shameful experience over recent years where we have not been able to respond as generously as some of the poorest countries have.",3
"Yes Contrary to some of the disgusting racist rhetoric about refugees on social media platforms, most displaced people find refuge in countries neighbouring their homes.",3
"We know—it has already been said—that it is the poorest countries, including Aruba, Pakistan, Uganda and Sudan, that provide refuge for the majority of asylum seekers, hosting more than 90% worldwide Having fled their country and claimed asylum, refugees often end up in the densely packed camps that we have heard about.",3
"At the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, where 76,000 Syrian refugees shelter, Médecins Sans Frontières has reported a covid outbreak in recent weeks.",3
"The head of mission there said that it is clear that the densely populated refugee camp can make it “very difficult for people to follow simple preventive measures such as handwashing, wearing a mask and physical distancing.” Self-isolation is another matter.",3
"In this country, we are rightly told to cover up, to wash our hands and to make space, but that simply is not possible for many refugees, at home and abroad.",2
"As I said, self-isolation is near impossible in the conditions in which many live At home, in response to the covid pandemic, the Government decided to pause the refugee resettlement scheme in March.",3
The Government say that most of these crossings are facilitated by criminal gangs seeking to exploit vulnerable migrants trying to reach the UK.,3
"According to the Immigration Minister, so far this year 24 people have been convicted and jailed for facilitating illegal immigration.",3
"As well as covid-19 having devastating impacts on refugee communities abroad, in our own country refugees are also suffering.",2
"My constituency is home to a number of refugee families, and I have had casework where those seeking asylum have had their asylum applications delayed as a result of the pandemic.",3
"My experience of the length of asylum applications is certainly not that it is the six months that the Government say it is; it is closer to two years, and I have some asylum seekers for whom it is stretching into years after that To add to this hiatus—this pause in people’s lives; they cannot get on with living their lives—by having it extended by the pandemic must feel like purgatory, and it has had a huge emotional impact on the families involved.",3
"For asylum seekers in a house in multiple occupation, not only is it difficult to socially distance, but with £5.39 a day to cover everything, buying PPE and hand sanitiser cuts deeply into their allowance—although I know some food banks, including my own in Oldham, have been providing them.",3
"In this environment, it is understandable that for many asylum seekers poor mental health is made even worse Other people have raised the difficulties they have faced after asylum has been granted.",3
Many support services have been closed and some refugees do not have access to the internet or phones.,3
"I have had reports of refugees becoming homeless after receiving their legal status, as the Home Office has continued to remove people from Serco housing with nowhere left for them to go.",3
Refugee Action has spoken of the impact this has had on the physical and mental wellbeing of refugees.,3
"In Oldham, I have seen first-hand the extraordinary work performed by the food bank and other charities, such as the British Red Cross, Revive and the Boaz Trust in Manchester, who have supported the most vulnerable people in society throughout the pandemic, many of whom are from the refugee community.",3
"Before the covid pandemic, these charities used to organise meetings and I also urge that, where possible, these meetings be reinstated Asylum seekers and refugees want to work—they want to contribute—but we have a system that does not afford refugees the dignity and respect they deserve, and the pandemic has exposed these glaring issues.",3
"I know of medical professionals from Syria who want to work but who are not being allowed to, and I again urge the Minister to speak with his counterparts in the Home Office It was fantastic news at the beginning of the week when we heard about the success of the covid vaccine trials from the Pfizer and BioNTech partnership, but that provides a salutary lesson: it is a German couple who started out life as Turkish children and became migrants who have managed to do this.",3
"The Government must help all people to use their abilities and to flourish in this great country of ours, including our refugees and asylum seekers.",2
"Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Rushanara Ali) on securing this important debate This year, especially during the first covid lockdown period, much has been said and written about people attempting to reach our UK shores by boat.",3
"They are detained, locked up, cut off and encamped in muddy, disease-ridden, ramshackle, makeshift and flimsy canvas or cardboard shelters that are not fit for purpose, and not fit for families, for children and for pregnant women—not even for animals To everyone who has ever shared anti-immigrant hatred and fear on social media, I would like to say, “Imagine it was you.",3
"Imagine that you knew that staying in their place of birth was so dangerous that it was better, safer and a little less horrifying to attempt to cross an incredibly lethal stretch of water in an unsafe boat—overcrowded, ill-equipped and with the chance of drowning a very real possibility.” In countries such as ours, we seek thrills and recreate fear by taking up certain pursuits.",3
The covid pandemic has greatly increased an already significant backlog in processing asylum applications.,3
"Charities such as the excellent Kent Refugee Action Network, or KRAN, do their best to support young, mostly unaccompanied asylum seekers.",3
"Young people are isolated, facing the lack of a college place, often of any decent accommodation at all and of any help with language, and they have no way to connect online to learn or access services or to find missing family members With the proper support, young refugees can and will contribute much to our society.",3
"We have many examples of those who have come to Britain seeking asylum, fleeing terror or war.",4
"To name just two, one of the best of people, as we have heard before, is Lord Alf Dubs, an incredible man who has dedicated his life to the safety of children who, like him, had to escape to a new place; and Gulwali Passarlay, a former asylum seeker, is the author of “The Lightless Sky” I urge the Government to pledge directly to help those countries in dire need of aid so that we create fewer refugees, fewer homeless and displaced desperate people, and less of a food, insecurity and climate emergency, and to allow the still relatively tiny numbers of the most desperate people to seek asylum here and a safe new start.",3
We have already increased funding for our police and intelligence services for this year and legislated to give them stronger powers to seize passports and prevent travel.,3
That means breaking the business model of the smugglers by breaking the link between getting in a boat and getting a chance to arrive and settle in Europe.,3
"By contrast, focusing primarily on setting up a relocation scheme for migrants who have already arrived in Europe could be counterproductive, because instead of breaking the smugglers’ business model it makes their offer more attractive.",3
"We will, however, enhance our plans to resettle the most vulnerable refugees from outside the EU, most notably from Syrian refugee camps, in line with the announcement I made in Bratislava earlier this month.",3
"And at this Council I set out the case for substantive reform in four areas: sovereignty, fairness, immigration and competitiveness First on sovereignty, Britain will not support being part of an ever-closer union or being dragged into a state called Europe.",3
"We want national parliaments to be able to work together to have more power, not less Secondly, on fairness, as the eurozone integrates further, the EU has got to be flexible enough to make sure the interests of both those inside and outside the eurozone are fairly balanced.",3
"Thirdly, on immigration, we need to tackle the welfare incentives that attract so many people from across the EU to seek work in Britain.",2
"We have all been struck by the tragic images of desperate refugees putting their lives in the hands of criminal gangs and people smugglers, risking and sometimes losing their lives.",2
"Some 4 million people have fled from Syria to countries in the region, and 7.6 million are internally displaced The lack of effective law and law enforcement in Libya has facilitated the growth of smugglers and smuggling networks.",3
"The year 2013 saw just under 43,000 migrants making the sea crossing from Libya to Italy; this rapidly increased to 170,100 in 2014.",3
"Many of the people crossing the Mediterranean are fleeing conflict and insecurity, and it is estimated that at least 5% of migrants making the crossing die on the way.",2
"To date, we have pledged more than £1 billion to help Syrian refugees in the region, making us the second biggest bilateral donor after the United States.",3
More than half of all registered refugees from Syria are children.,2
"This will support 59,000 more free school places for Syrian refugees and vulnerable children.",3
"It will also provide education to 30,000 out-of-school refugees and poor Lebanese children.",3
"Investing in education supports the aspirations of Syrian refugee families, helping them make the academic progress that will enable them to make a contribution to the region and ultimately return to rebuild Syria In Syria 4.6 million people live in areas where humanitarian access is extremely restricted.",3
In response the UK co-sponsored and lobbied hard for the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 2165 and 2191 which enable the UN to deliver aid across the border without the consent of the Assad regime.,3
Between the adoption of the resolutions and the end of August this year the UN and its partners have delivered 175 convoys across the border.,3
"These convoys of aid are helping to provide food, blankets, water kits and vital medical supplies to thousands of people in Syria Without the humanitarian support led and often shaped by the UK, many more refugees could risk their lives in the journey to Europe, so we are also taking action to provide support to those refugees closer to home.",3
"We have already provided sanctuary to more than 5,000 Syrian refugees since the conflict began.",3
"On Monday last week the Prime Minister announced that over the lifetime of this Parliament we will expand the Syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme to resettle up to 20,000 additional Syrians in need of protection, the costs for this scheme being funded through overseas development assistance for the first 12 months after arrival The Syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme has prioritised those who cannot be supported effectively in their region of origin—women and children at risk, people in severe need of medical care and survivors of torture and violence.",3
The scheme is in addition to those we resettle under other programmes which offer protection in the UK under normal asylum procedures.,3
"Indeed, around 3% of the 11 million Syrians displaced by the conflict are claiming asylum in Europe.",3
"The immediate refugee crisis can be tackled only by effective, co-ordinated EU and international action supported by much-needed resources At the same time, dealing with the humanitarian crisis and ensuring aid reaches those who need it is not enough.",3
"Eighty per cent of refugee crises last for 10 years or more, and two in every five last for 20 years or more.",3
"This means children born in refugee camps today are likely to grow up in exile, away from home.",3
"It also means we need a step change in the way international communities support refugees, recognising that the current international model works for short-term support but not protracted displacement.",3
"We wish him and his family many happy and peaceful years, in which I hope he will be able to pursue his passion for the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Over 30 years ago, I bathed from deserted beaches on the island of Lesbos; today, lifejackets discarded by refugees cover the beaches.",3
"Lesbos has received about half of the 250,000 refugees who have reached Greece this year.",3
I hope that the Minister will be able to give us more information this evening and that Parliament will be kept fully informed of the outcome of the discussions The vulnerable are not confined to Syria and its borders.,3
Would I be right in thinking that these cases will be dealt with under the normal asylum procedures?,4
"Last year, 120,000 refugees were living in the UK, and 25,000 entered the asylum system seeking asylum in this country I have concentrated on vulnerable refugees: the 4 million in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, the more than 6 million displaced from their homes but still in Syria itself and those fleeing from brutal regimes in Africa.",3
"Like the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, I believe that the situation created by the flood of economic migrants who have been pouring into Europe from the Middle East and North Africa is different.",2
"They have been coming in numbers that, taken together with the real refugees, are likely to have profound social, cultural, religious and economic consequences and create growing tension.",2
We have to pursue policies that will discourage and reverse that floodtide of economic migrants.,2
"I support the Government’s policy, including the measures described by the Home Secretary last week, their refusal to take part in a European quota system and the new naval activity off the Libyan coast, for which I understand that we are now seeking United Nations approval so that we can deal with some of the criminal gangs before they take refugees on board Population densities, birth rates and job opportunities vary enormously from country to country.",3
"Britain is densely populated and has absorbed a very large increase in immigrant numbers, so that facilities are strained.",2
"Even Germany temporarily closed its borders this week, and other countries in Europe are closing theirs The noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, called for a more measured approach.",3
His was a pretty emotional diatribe which offered few measured solutions I conclude by noting that Jordan has been remarkably successful in creating a buffer zone in southern Syria where large numbers of refugees have gathered in their own country.,3
"It would be an important step if it was possible to create a similar secure buffer zone in north-west Syria, and hugely helpful if the Gulf states, in addition to providing financial support, would take immigrants to ease the burden falling on Lebanon, in particular.",3
"We cannot say that we got involved because we wanted to avoid a refugee crisis, because it was the fighting that produced that crisis Most peculiarly of all, the decision flew in the face of all the lessons that I thought any sensible person would have learnt from Iraq and Libya—that trying to change regimes in other countries is always a problematic exercise and should never be embarked on unless one has available a viable and credible alternative regime to impose.",3
"That is a very serious matter, but it cannot be very clever to engage in two wars at the same time, when one was inevitable That is the inept part of the story; the unedifying part of the story is the way in which we have handled the refugee crisis over the past few weeks and months.",3
"Until the PR agenda changed—because that is what changed everything, when the picture of the dead child on the beach was all over the newspapers—the Government were taking a very tough line, saying that they were not going to have any significant numbers of Syrian or other refugees here at all.",3
"The Government were completely obsessed by maintaining their arbitrary 100,000 person a year immigration total.",3
"Then suddenly, because the PR equation changed, they started making all sorts of declarations about receiving refugees and doing something for them.",3
"What is more, as the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, pointed out very well, we are not actually taking the refugees who are most vulnerable, those who are on the road and have no accommodation or food and are in serious danger of dying on their travels.",3
"The refugees in camps are obviously not very comfortable in them, but at least they do not face those threats quite so immediately One has to wonder why we have not taken up our quota under the EU system.",3
That is very important as it is very important in this crisis that we encourage the Gulf states to take refugees from Syria.,3
"That is the most obvious solution because those economies are systematically dependent on immigrant labour and they are common cultural and linguistic areas, so it would be an obvious thing to do.",4
"But they are not taking any refugees; they are just paying cheques to keep people in camps, just like we are doing.",3
"Secondly, we should under no circumstances allow this to be a precedent, so that anybody who comes from a civil war or an area where there is a lot of violence can immediately claim asylum in the European Union or this country.",3
"She has now belatedly realised that Sangatte is a problem for us Actually, it is a problem for us if these refugees come into southern Europe or the Balkans.",3
"I believe we, together with our EU counter- parts, should invest considerable naval resources in patrolling the Mediterranean to make sure that these poor people coming through on boats run by criminal organisations—criminal gangs in many cases—do not get through to the mainland of the European Union.",3
"As a result of the conflict there is also widespread unrest in neighbouring countries that for the past four years have absorbed the vast majority of the refugees Turkey, as the noble Lord, Lord Williams, just mentioned, has close to 3 million refugees now.",3
The landscape there has been irreparably damaged and affected Turkey has welcomed those 3 million refugees regardless of their religion.,3
It is a predominantly Muslim country but it has not looked at people’s faith; it has taken in people who have come to their borders.,4
"The Turks have opened their borders and been criticised for doing so, but nevertheless they have taken people in So neighbouring countries have been absorbing this.",3
I have seen various reports talking about migrants coming here to seek a better life.,3
These are not economic migrants but refugees.,2
"The use of the word “migrants” to describe people fleeing Daesh is absurd, inhumane and misleading As we have heard, it took a photograph of a little boy on a beach in Turkey to start to change public opinion.",3
Far more people are beginning to realise that this is not an immigration problem but a humanitarian disaster We have seen that the Germans have welcomed the majority so far and have shown incredible leadership and humanity.,3
"It is particularly shocking that Hungary, for example, has said that it will take only Christians as asylum seekers.",3
"In behaving in that fashion, Hungary is not fit to be a member of the EU This is the biggest refugee population from a single conflict in a generation.",3
Today I have read reports that in Jordan cuts to aid are forcing more refugees to leave the camps and come to Europe.,3
"It is ironic that the Government have been warning us often and repeatedly that we are under threat from Daesh and that we must do more to stop some Muslim people from going to Syria to join it, yet when it comes to allowing sanctuary to Syrians fleeing the murderous Daesh we close our doors, pull up the drawbridge and refer to them as migrants.",3
We on these Benches believe that the UK should work with the UN to resettle its fair share of refugees already in Europe.,3
"The UK’s fair share would be established by considering a wide range of criteria including population, GDP and asylum-seeking cases.",3
I am sure that she and her wonderful officials will endeavour to assist us in this regard High on the news agenda this summer have been those whom some have termed “swarms” of migrants or “marauding” migrants: the terrible scenes of overcrowded boats plying their way across the Mediterranean.,3
"I think of his poor mother, who could not swim and did not want to take a boat at all.",3
"I think of the Canadians who refused his family asylum We have to put a human face on refugees, to recognise that they are as us and our own children.",3
"I hope that we have now moved beyond the use of words such as “swarm” and “marauding”, but are we seeing an effective answer to a hugely pressing crisis We know that the refugees are from war-torn and desperately fragile states: above all, at the moment, Syria, but also, as the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, has pointed out, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Iraq and Afghanistan.",3
"The noble Baroness, Lady Helic, knows a thing or two about conflict and refugees.",3
"We need to lead, not reluctantly follow We welcome the increase in resettlement of refugees from camps in Syria and the region, but it is too little too late and does nothing to tackle the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Europe.",3
"Can the Minister assure us that the UK is able to opt in to take refugees who arrive in the UK, despite what her noble friend Lady Stowell said the other day?",3
"That includes accepting a small number of refugees who are already in Europe, but also seeking better ways to manage the EU’s external borders and strengthen the EU asylum process.",3
Many of those fleeing have ended up in the refugee camps in the surrounding region.,3
We know only too well how destabilising it is to have millions of refugees in the fragile countries around.,2
"I note what has been said about using ODA for refugees in the UK, and I realise that it is permissible, but it is a concern.",4
Can the Minister tell me when the aid budget was first used to support refugees in the UK?,3
Can she tell me how much was used each year in the last five years to support refugees in the UK?,3
Does she accept that the ODA budget cannot be used to integrate refugees in a donor country’s economy?,3
What are the implications if they are to be so integrated?,3
Can she tell me what happens to the support for refugees after the first year has concluded?,3
"The Government have rightly been commended for their action in supporting refugees in the region—but, from all sides, the Government have been condemned for inaction in inadequately supporting refugees in the United Kingdom and for inaction internationally, and especially for inaction in the appalling inability to work with the EU and to help to lead in the EU to resolve this crisis, with a terrible effect on refugees themselves but also in terms of our very place in Europe.",3
"He has made a huge impact on politics in the United Kingdom, and on behalf of the Opposition I would like to wish him very well in his retirement The crisis in the Middle East and north Africa has created a humanitarian disaster on the borders of Europe, which has now spread into Europe itself.",3
"There are no simple answers to stopping the number of refugees, and therefore we, in the international community, must accept that we have a moral obligation to support those in desperate need, not just in the immediate region but in Europe and our own country, despite it not being part of the Schengen area Nobody can deny the UK Government’s generosity in supporting camps on the border of Syria.",3
"The statistic quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, on the percentage of refugees from Syria being helped in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey is worth repeating; it is 94%.",3
"But now that people are on the move, countries on the borders of the EU, such as Greece and Hungary, are under considerable strain.",3
"Greece is under profound economic pressure, and it does not seem fair that accident of geography determines how many asylum seekers each nation must bear.",2
"The fact is that the Government misread the views of the British public on this issue, and a determination to dance to the tune of the anti-immigration lobby has back-fired.",3
"The Government are, I know, already working with our European partners to challenge the criminals who are trafficking these people and taking advantage of their desperation, and we need to support Europol and police forces across the EU to do more.",3
"How would we co-operate on these issues if we were outside the EU—who knows We welcome the deployment of HMS “Richmond” to operations in the Mediterranean, but let us not forget that the work of this vessel will be limited to searching for and seizing smugglers’ vessels.",3
"Is she confident that the search and rescue capability—which should be distinguished from the attempt to stop traffickers—is equal to the task of saving lives in the Mediterranean We welcome the Prime Minister’s belated decision, following that public outcry, to agree to welcome 20,000 Syrians from the border refugee camps by the end of this Parliament.",3
"The Government must stop confusing people with talk of Schengen, asylum seekers, refugees and the free movement of people in the EU and all their rights in one breath.",3
"All of these are different, and confusing those issues stirs the sensitive immigration debate in a way that is unnecessary.",2
"Desperate people will not wait for the Government to act, and it is in our interests to work in concert with other European member states It is clear that the Dublin regulation, the system that prevents asylum application to numerous EU member states, has stalled, and that there are considerable strains on the Schengen open-border system.",3
"How can the Government set a cap on the number of asylum seekers coming to this country over five years when they have no idea how the situation will unfold in the next few weeks, let alone the next five years?",3
"The time for action and help is now, so why not get on with the job and bring 10,000 people in before Christmas A senior UN official has claimed that, if the war continues, 1 million more refugees will find their way to Europe by the end of this year.",3
"We know that there are no quick fixes or immediate answers, but some kind of strategy would be a good start The issue of immigration is one of the greatest challenges of our time.",2
We must not forget that at one stage or another we were all immigrants to this country.,3
I remember that when I was a little girl our family was asked to take care of a Vietnamese boat family.,3
"They came, integrated and contributed in a real way to the economy and to the community.",3
Today’s asylum seekers will do the same.,3
"In the long term, it is a false economy to raid the overseas budget We have an immediate problem now, though.",2
"My Lords, with the leave of the House, I will repeat a Statement given earlier today in another place by my honourable friend the Immigration Minister, James Brokenshire “Mr Speaker, last Thursday evening, Border Force officers at the port of Harwich detected and intercepted 68 migrants who were seeking to enter the UK illegally and clandestinely.",3
Among the 68 migrants found were two pregnant women and 15 children.,3
Seven migrants complained of chest pains and nausea and were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure.,3
All four drivers of the lorries involved were arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration.,3
"Some of the individuals have claimed asylum, and UK Visas and Immigration is considering their claims, including suitability for the “detained fast track” process.",3
Two of the asylum seekers are unaccompanied minors and have been placed in the care of Essex social services.,3
"We have already begun the work to seek the removal of the remaining migrants from the UK If we can show that those who are claiming asylum have also claimed in another EU member state, we will seek to remove them under the Dublin regulation.",3
"This regulation has allowed us to remove 12,000 asylum seekers from the UK since it came into force in 2003.",3
"However, it relies on member states fulfilling their obligations systematically to identify and fingerprint migrants apprehended at the EU border.",3
"This Government are clear that the EU’s approach to migratory flows must include proper management of the external border, the prompt return of those who are not in genuine need of protection and action to tackle the efforts of smugglers and traffickers who profit from human misery I am aware that my honourable friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex visited the port on Friday, which is in his constituency.",3
"Among other successful operations in recent months, the Border Force team has made some significant seizures, including 15 kilograms of heroin in December, 17 kilograms of cocaine in May and 2.9 million cigarettes in March With regards to the specific problem of clandestine immigrants, Border Force concentrates a significant amount of resource at the juxtaposed ports in northern France, where the vast majority of illegal border crossings are attempted.",3
"Border Force is able to, and does, move its resources around on the basis of threat to ensure that we keep one step ahead of the criminal gangs that exploit vulnerable people and try to circumvent our immigration laws The important work that Border Force officers carry out detecting and intercepting those who attempt to enter the UK illegally, in conjunction with law enforcement agencies in the UK and internationally, is vital in the fight against organised criminal networks engaged in people smuggling.",3
I commend Border Force for its discovery last week and for the work that it does to protect the UK’s borders.,3
"Does he agree that proper management of the EU’s external border is the key to solving these issues, and that the UK is in a far better position within the EU to influence member states than it would be if it were outside the European Union?",3
"The Minister also mentioned the Dublin regulation and the fact that more than 12,000 illegal immigrants who claimed asylum initially in other EU states had been deported from the UK as a result of that regulation.",3
"More generally, the disruption caused backlogs of traffic in the Calais area, which presented existing migrants around the town with opportunities to attempt to enter slow-moving lorries The French and UK Governments were well prepared for this event.",3
"Despite the extra pressure caused by the French strikers, Border Force maintained border security by following plans to put additional staff in place to search freight vehicles passing through the affected ports during the industrial action and thereafter.",3
"During the course of yesterday’s disruption and since, the Border Force and the French authorities have successfully identified and intercepted a significant number of would-be migrants Last night, I spoke with the French Interior Minister, Bernard Cazeneuve.",3
Our two Governments have been working closely and constructively in recent months to bolster security at the juxtaposed border at Calais and other French ports.,3
"We will continue to work with Eurotunnel and the French authorities on installing additional security measures at the site to prevent migrants from making incursions into the port More broadly, the ongoing situation in Calais serves as an important reminder of why EU member states need to work together to tackle the causes of illegal immigration in source and transit countries.",3
We are already co-operating closely with the French to tackle the organised criminal gangs that facilitate the movement of migrants into and across Europe.,3
"UK and French law enforcement organisations have already had considerable success in dismantling criminal networks behind people trafficking and smuggling on both sides of the channel, resulting in the prosecution of 223 individuals, and Monsieur Cazeneuve and I have agreed to build on this important work.",3
"As the Prime Minister and I have repeatedly made clear, the most important step to resolving the situation in the Mediterranean is breaking the link between migrants making this dangerous journey and achieving settlement in Europe.",3
"There will, however, continue to be a significant border security operation as the backlogs of traffic are cleared at the affected ports.",3
"I am sure the whole House will want to join me in commending the excellent work done by the Border Force, Kent Police and others on both sides of the channel who have worked tirelessly to maintain border security and minimise disruption to the travelling public.",3
"My Lords, according to the UN refugee agency, in the first 10 months of 2014, the number of asylum seekers in Europe from Eritrea nearly tripled.",3
"In Ethiopia and Sudan, the number of Eritrean refugees also increased sharply.",3
"Most asylum requests have been lodged in Sweden, Germany and Switzerland, with the vast majority arriving by boat from across the Mediterranean.",3
"Eritreans were the second largest group to arrive in Italy by boat, after the Syrians.",3
"An unprecedented number of Eritreans are fleeing their country as refugees, on a precarious journey to Europe as well as to bordering countries.",3
"As at mid-2013, the UNHCR estimated that the total population of concern originating from Eritrea was more than 313,000 people, including more than 292,000 refugees and 20,000 asylum seekers.",3
"If this were the case, one would surely expect to see refugees from other developing countries fleeing in similar epic proportions.",3
The fall-out between the two former brothers in arms initiated a two-year long border war in 1998.,3
"Apparently triggered by a dispute over the border district of Badme, the war claimed about 100,000 casualties, cost billions of dollars, and remains the main source of instability in the region Fighting ended with the signing of the Algiers peace agreement and establishment of the Ethiopia-Eritrea border commission in 2000.",3
"Initially, Ethiopia refused to accept the commission’s findings and refused to withdraw to the border that it had established, leaving thousands of internally displaced people in refugee camps Ethiopia eventually accepted the commission’s ruling in 2006, but its implementation continues to be the source of severe tension between the two Governments.",3
"Indeed, the UN special rapporteur on Eritrea stated in her second report in May 2014 that she holds the view that border issues should not serve as an excuse for the Government of Eritrea to violate the rights of their citizens within their own territory Furthermore, a sustainable peace is unlikely to emerge as long as conflict is seen solely in terms of border demarcation.",3
"Economic incentives are central to enabling improved relations between the two states, although prospective economic benefits from reopening the border are unlikely to be persuasive, given that they were unable to prevent the war.",3
"Waiting for changes of leadership before making significant efforts to engage is, however, untenable, with no guarantee that successors would adopt a different foreign policy In discussions prior to this debate, it has been claimed by Eritrean Government supporters that the Eritrean Government now plan to restrict national service to 18 months as set out in law, probably by the end of the year.",3
"These have been commented on in the past but can my noble friend provide an update, for example on the outcomes of meetings of FCO and Home Office officials with Eritrean Ministers in December; on EU negotiations on policies towards Eritrea, to suppress the number of refugees from that country; and on the release of political prisoners in Eritrea since FCO officials raised the issue with the Eritrean ambassador in March 2004, considering that since then a new ambassador has been appointed?",3
"Following my noble friend’s excellent speech and the point he made on Ethiopia, we must recognise, however, that that country is now host to more than 600,000 immigrants—the highest number of refugees taken in by any African country.",3
The Government of Ethiopia should be highly commended for accepting and managing so many with such scant resources—and not attacked The first question is where these refugees come from.,3
"Then there is the huge number—more than 160,000—of recent returnee refugees: Ethiopians returning to Addis Ababa from Saudi Arabia since the amnesty there granted by the late King Abdullah ended.",3
Ethiopia and its Eritrean refugees generate by far the largest number of migrants out of the Horn of Africa to the Yemen and through Djibouti.,2
"They are all working to promote sustainable livelihoods and then to anchor the otherwise wannabe migrants, whether they are refugees in transit from the countries I have described or younger native-born Ethiopians seeking the somewhat illusory betterment that they think they might get abroad through migration As it happens, my own daughter, Mary-Claire, is not long back from a visit to Tigray in northern Ethiopia, with CAFOD, for whom she works, happily just in time for this debate.",3
"She has told me what it is like on the Eritrean border, marked by just a line of straw across the asphalt track between the two countries.",3
"They also help organise farmers into co-operatives and support groups and get the young training in business, finance, numeracy and literacy, and lots more None of this is easy; nor is it easy at the moment for our own Government to deal with much of the raucous criticism of our taxpayer-funded overseas aid budget.",3
"If figures to this end are available, they might persuade more of our fellow citizens that the overseas aid budget is well spent on trying to anchor the otherwise migrant-inclined.",3
"As has been suggested, Eritreans and Ethiopians are the main nationalities of the irregular migrants seeking asylum in the EU, apart from Syrians.",3
The forced and interminable military service to fight the unending border war with the neighbours in Ethiopia is clearly a real problem that is driving people from the country There are some key points which we would like the Government to take on board.,3
Can the Minister give an assurance that the Government will support the UN in its work and ensure that an objective picture of the situation in the country can be assembled We are all aware that there are fears and concerns within the British population about the scale of immigration to the UK.,3
"Let us be clear: if Britain left the EU it would not stop people from coming, but it would stop us from working together in a co-ordinated fashion with our EU partners A €5 million programme is being established between FRONTEX—the agency of the EU that manages co-operation between national border guards to secure the external borders of the Union, including from illegal immigration, human trafficking and terrorist infiltration—and the UNHCR to help the countries of the western Balkans strengthen their asylum and migration policies and capabilities.",3
"I understand that it has assigned a member state expert to help the Turks to improve security around the port of Mersin The EU has also signed a readmission agreement with Turkey, which means that Turkey must take back not only nationals who may be irregular migrants, but migrants who are seen to have come from Turkey.",3
There is close and joint co-operation in the Aegean Sea and on the Greek and Bulgarian land borders.,3
"Finally, can the Minister clarify the situation relating to migrants from these two countries when they arrive in the UK?",3
What proportion of them are termed “irregular migrants”?,3
What proportion are given asylum status?,3
"As he has described, there are few more moving stories than those of migrants who undertake perilous journeys to reach western Europe, sometimes losing their lives in the process.",3
"Today’s debate is, therefore, a welcome opportunity to discuss an issue that clearly links the United Kingdom and our partners in Africa—and indeed, our partners in the European Union in our work to reduce the need for migration and the need for unsafe migration The Government have made it very clear that the international community must act together to reduce the risk of migrants losing their lives or falling prey to the traffickers.",3
Tackling illegal migration to the EU from the Horn of Africa is therefore clearly in our interest and that of all countries in the region.,3
"In addition to our bilateral work with key regional partners, we play an active role in the new EU-African Union Khartoum process, which includes of course both Ethiopia and Eritrea, supporting dialogue and co-operation to tackle people smuggling and human trafficking in the region.",3
"As a member of the core group of EU and AU member states steering the development of how we take this process forward, we as a country are keen to ensure that we maintain momentum and that the process leads quickly to concrete projects that combat the smuggling and trafficking Several noble Lords asked me, in particular, about extended military service—very much a euphemism.",3
"That is why some of the figures of asylum grants by us to Eritreans look so high, because clearly there has been concern about them returning to that country given their reasons for leaving We did indeed have a joint visit to Eritrea by Home Office and Foreign Office officials in December.",3
"Our funding is also helping Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia, particularly with shelter and support to unaccompanied minors, as well as warning refugees of the risks of illegal migration.",3
The problems that the report instances have arisen from measures that have been enacted in response to an unguarded declaration of the Prime Minster concerning the number of immigrants to the UK.,3
"The collateral damage that has been inflicted on the universities by an attempt to staunch the flow of immigrants in fulfilment of the policy has been immense To understand how foolish was the statement concerning net migration, one need only glance at table 1 of the committee’s report, which shows that in 2012-13 the total number of immigrants, which was roughly 500,000, was divided almost equally between immigrants from the European Union and from elsewhere.",3
"Short of leaving the Union, the Government can exercise no control over the numbers of European immigrants.",3
"When we look at the figures for non-EU immigrants, we find that in the year in question nearly 170,000 out of 240,000 immigrants were entrants to courses at publicly funded higher education institutions.",3
"It is only by radically reducing those numbers that any significant reduction in net migration could be achieved In providing courses to overseas students, the university sector constitutes a major export industry.",3
"By removing student migrants from the total, the Government could surely cut the numbers of recorded immigrants at a stroke.",3
The only conceivable reason for not doing so is that by removing the students from the figures the Government would be denying themselves a valued opportunity to show that their policies are having an effect on the numbers of immigrants It may be that the Government have begun to believe their own propaganda.,3
The few instances when that has been the case have been widely publicised in support of a highly erroneous perception The supposition that a large proportion of the students have fraudulent intentions goes some way towards explaining the nature of the numerous additional provisions and restrictions that have been imposed upon overseas students.,3
The conditions of the tier 4 student visas have been made increasingly stringent.,3
"On these grounds, he has been disbarred from pursuing his doctoral studies in the UK under the supervision of one of my academic colleagues I must now respond to the fact that the committee’s report is devoted primarily to the impact of the immigration regulations on the recruitment of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",3
"In effect, we depend upon overseas students for the maintenance of our scientific and technological skills.",3
"Such circumstances no longer prevail Nowadays, the numerous overseas recruits to our university departments are typically short-stay visitors.",3
"The House is very fortunate that he has joined us and to be able to look forward to his future contributions To attract here students of these subjects, in particular those from overseas, I would like to make a few brief points.",3
"There is an obvious need: to increase foreign student numbers which have been declining; to make them feel welcome and thus also, in the first place, to simplify their process of application for entry; to encourage them to stay to find employment with UK businesses and industry; for proper monitoring of our policies and assessments of their results—these to be viewed against those of our competitor countries; and for our Government to be alert to other associated and constructive expedients—for science, technology and mathematics not least would such include the considerable scope, to mutual advantage, for student exchanges between United Kingdom institutions and those elsewhere The noble Lord, Lord Krebs, mentioned falling numbers; my noble friend the Minister may point out that there has been a slight recovery.",3
"Several aspects may put off foreign students, and each of these is in our power to change.",3
There is a need for greater clarity in the publication of immigration statistics.,3
"So far, our presentations do not sufficiently distinguish student figures from those of all other immigrants.",3
This category is overseas students in possession of tier 4 visas.,3
"Does my noble friend the Minister agree that clear publication of their numbers as a separate immigration component would achieve two purposes: first, the removal of a government policy anomaly, where a Government restrict general immigration on one hand yet seek to increase student immigration on the other; and, secondly, that it would serve to help reverse the impression of many potential overseas students, to which many of your Lordships have referred, that they are unwelcome in the United Kingdom Foreign students are discouraged as well by unnecessary remaining complications within the application process itself.",3
Might the Government perhaps pursue this recommendation The Government have introduced a scheme for foreign students to stay on as graduate entrepreneurs.,3
"Thereby, foreign students would have much greater opportunity than they do now to prolong their studies and to take up employment with United Kingdom business and industry We also need frequent reviews of the effect of policies and of how our results compare with those of competitor countries.",3
"As a Council of Europe parliamentarian, it is a great privilege for me to have been asked to help with programmes for such exchanges between the United Kingdom and elsewhere At the same time, as the noble Earl, Lord Kinnoull, reminded us, the United Kingdom must not fall behind the standards of competitor countries, which equally seek to attract foreign students to their own economies.",3
"It is true to say, I think, that the whole House wants to see foreign criminals deported The Prime Minister said that this would be a priority for his Government, but as with so many promises he has made, he is not keeping to his word.",3
Last year more than 500 fewer foreign criminals were removed than in Labour’s last year in office in 2009.,3
"On top of that, the National Audit Office released a scathing report in October 2014 on the Home Office’s management of foreign national offenders.",3
"In its very interesting report, the NAO stated that we have worse systems in our country than other European countries for preventing foreign criminals from entering in the first place, due in part to the delay in joining the second-generation Schengen information system, which we finally joined only a month ago.",3
Our joining was delayed because of the Home Secretary’s decision to exercise the opt-out on co-operation with Europe—a fact that put border security at risk and has longer-term consequences for the safety and security of our country The hon.,3
"Gentleman is absolutely right, therefore, to make the argument that he makes today, and we agree that there need to be more stringent controls on foreign offenders, but we do not agree with the proposals in the Bill, even if we agree with the intentions.",3
"It would put Britain in contravention of the European convention on human rights at the very time we are arguing in foreign policy terms that countries such as Russia and Ukraine should respect the European convention, and that countries such as Belarus should sign up to the convention.",3
We agree with that advice and consequently cannot vote for something that is illegal A similar proposal was debated in the course of the Immigration Bill.,3
"The Home Secretary stated that it was incompatible with the European convention on human rights, and that she was concerned about the practical application of the new clause, arguing that it would “effectively hinder our ability to deport people for a period of time because there would be considerable legal wrangling about the issue.”—[Official Report, 30 January 2014; Vol.",3
"We support the principle behind the Bill that more foreign criminals should be deported, especially given how poor the Government’s track record has been, but if the Bill were passed it might well have the unintended consequence of creating legal barriers to deportation as foreign criminals tied up the courts with challenges to their deportation.",3
I welcome the fact that the Opposition now apparently want to ensure that we have the appropriate checks at the border.,3
"Once this Government came to power, we were able to have the 100% checks at the border that were not there before.",3
"We scrapped the old UK Border Agency and created Border Force, with the focus, the culture and the agenda to have tough and rigorous checks at the border while making sure that that is done efficiently and effectively to allow people to pass through, using technology to advance that process The hon.",3
"Gentleman referred to Labour’s promise of 1,000 extra border guards.",3
That is virtually the only promise or pledge that we have heard from Labour on the important issue of immigration and tightening and securing our borders.,3
The cost is apparently to be met by additional charges for those in electronic visa waiver schemes.,3
"On our calculations, that would generate perhaps an extra 20 or 30 border guards.",3
"I look forward to hearing some further details from the Opposition as to how their numbers add up and how their proposal would work I want to highlight this Government’s record in having removed just under 5,100 foreign national offenders from the UK in the past year.",3
"The fact that we have, as I said, removed just under 5,100 foreign national offenders from the UK in the past five years is due to a great deal of attention and careful joint working among a number of Government Departments—the Home Office and colleagues in the Ministry of Justice and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office My hon.",3
"To have a robust and rigorous system, we need a joined-up system I will touch on the issue of preventing those who should not be here from coming to this country in the first place and the excellent work the police and others are doing to identify foreign national offenders.",3
"When we want someone to be removed, we need to obtain a passport or other evidence in order to prove their identity; to get travel documents to ensure that they can be deported; and to make sure that the receiving country does not simply return them to our shores.",3
There has been some important and excellent cross-governmental work to deal with those barriers to removal A range of measures and powers are used to remove foreign national offenders from the UK.,3
"The primary power is automatic deportation for non-European economic area nationals who are convicted in the UK and given a single custodial sentence of 12 months or more for one conviction; or, where automatic deportation cannot be applied, we can seek to deport on conducive grounds, including looking at the cumulative effect of offending and whether it is in the public interest to seek to deport Once a person has been deported they are prohibited from entering the UK while the deportation order against them remains in force.",3
A deportation order has no expiry date: it remains in force indefinitely unless a decision is taken to revoke it.,3
"That demonstrates the strength and purpose behind our existing deportation system, and it is important to recognise that we have strengthened it further through the Immigration Act.",3
Border Force checks against the warnings index to identify whether anyone coming through our border is subject to those outstanding deportation orders.,3
"Friend that, under the existing system, we are able to keep out people who have been deported from this country.",3
Friend is right about the distinction between EU and non-EU and how it applies to deportation.,3
"That is a broader debate than that on the specific issue of foreign national offenders Last July, new powers came into force to stop criminals using weak family life arguments to delay their deportation.",3
Section 19 of the 2014 Act put into statute the principle that the law should be on the side of the public and that the starting point is to expect that foreign criminals will be deported.,3
"The more serious the offence, the greater the public interest in the criminal’s deportation.",3
"Section 19 ensures that the courts can be in no doubt about when the public interest requires the deportation of foreign criminals We also changed the law so that when there is no risk of serious irreversible harm, foreign criminals can be deported first and have their appeal heard later.",3
"Last October, the number of grounds on which foreign criminals could appeal against their deportation was cut from 17 to four.",3
"We have also removed a significant number of foreign national offenders year on year, despite having to deal with the legal system we inherited and despite seeing a near 30% increase in the number of legal challenges.",3
"Our changes are not about denying people a right of appeal, but about streamlining an appeals system that offered too many bites of the cherry, took too long to conclude and, inevitably, led to foreign criminals remaining in the UK for longer than should have been the case We will always seek to deport serious foreign criminals.",3
"When the level of offending does not meet the threshold for deportation, we will take administrative action to remove offenders who have no right to be in the UK.",3
"Subject to certain exceptions, foreign national offenders who have received a custodial sentence can be administratively removed from the UK and will face a mandatory refusal under the immigration rules on entry clearance or leave to enter the UK The other power that is used to keep foreign national offenders out of the UK is exclusion, although I suspect it is not the exclusion envisaged in the title of my hon.",4
"To avoid any misunderstanding, exclusion is a decision taken personally by the Secretary of State that is used to prevent a foreign national who is outside the UK from entering the country.",3
"As with a deportation order, an exclusion decision prohibits the person from entering the UK while it remains in force.",3
"Aside from cases of foreign criminals, we have used it to keep hate preachers out of the country.",3
I hope that that gives him some assurance on the firm and rigorous approach that the Government take in seeking to assure the security and safety of the citizens of this country from foreign national offenders and others who would seek to foment tension in our communities and the criminality that may arise from that.,3
"The free movement directive, by which all EU member states are bound, provides that EEA nationals and their family members have certain rights to live and work in other EU countries The UK has implemented the directive by way of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, which provide the power to deport, exclude or administratively remove EEA nationals and their family members from the UK.",4
"EEA nationals can be deported from the UK on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.",4
"All EEA nationals who receive a custodial sentence are considered for deportation or administrative removal, including individuals who engage in persistent low-level offending.",3
"We take a robust approach when considering and pursuing the deportation of EEA national offenders, working within the terms of the directive A decision to deport cannot be made solely on the basis of a person’s previous criminal convictions and we must balance other factors.",3
"Therefore if the Bill intends that an EEA national convicted of an offence in the UK should be deported solely on the basis of that conviction, regardless of the nature of the offending and without the assessment of the case’s individual circumstances or the proportionality of deportation action, it would not be consistent with the freedom of movement directive My hon.",3
"There is also the refugee convention, in which I know he has taken a long-standing interest, and other provisions are contained in that.",3
"I want to update the House on the action the Government are taking to tackle illegal immigration, particularly in the light of the current situation in the Mediterranean and the disruption caused by the recent strikes that affected the port of Calais and the Eurotunnel site at Coquelles The close co-operation between the United Kingdom and France on the issue dates back many years, and our Governments have been working closely together to respond to the pressure caused by the growing number of people migrating across the Mediterranean in recent months As the House will be aware, aggressive strike action by French port workers recently exacerbated that pressure, temporarily closing the port of Calais and disrupting Eurotunnel services.",3
"Illegal migrants in France, taking advantage of the situation, made increasingly bold attempts to board vehicles heading for the UK, and we heard worrying reports about intimidating and violent behaviour I am conscious of the forbearance of the residents of Kent, who suffered disruption due to the build-up of traffic on local roads caused by the French strike.",3
"Freight vehicles entering Calais, the Eurotunnel site at Coquelles and Dunkirk underwent intensified screening for clandestine illegal entrants, using some of the best techniques and technologies in the world, including sniffer dogs, carbon dioxide detectors, heartbeat monitors and scanners, as well as visual searches to find and intercept stowaways.",3
"Between 21 June and 11 July, over 8,000 attempts by illegal migrants were successfully intercepted at juxtaposed ports in France through the joint efforts of the French and British authorities That reflects the particular pressures caused by the recent industrial action, but Her Majesty’s Government have been working closely with the French Government for much longer to deal with the broader situation in Calais.",3
"We continue to keep the situation under review and will assess whether further measures may be required As I have mentioned, the recent strike action has had significant implications for the travelling public and, in particular, for hauliers, who have been subjected not only to long delays but repeated attempts by illegal migrants who try to stow themselves away in their vehicles.",3
It is of course important that vehicles are secured properly to help mitigate the threat of illegal immigration.,2
"However, as the vast majority of vehicles arriving in the UK are foreign registered, the bigger part of our challenge is international.",3
"This should transform protection for lorries and their drivers, removing them from the open road where they can become targets for migrants attempting to board their vehicles The problems in Calais are clearly symptomatic of a wider issue that needs to be tackled at source and in transit countries.",3
"To this end, we are enhancing our work with European and African partners to tackle these callous criminal gangs and increase the support for genuine refugees in their regions of origin Recently, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a dedicated law enforcement team to tackle organised immigration crime in the Mediterranean.",3
"In addition, we are providing practical and financial support to other EU countries, including help to process newly arrived illegal immigrants and distinguish between economic migrants and genuine refugees We must also work to stop this problem at source.",3
The UK has a proud record of providing aid to alleviate poverty and suffering overseas.,4
"We have committed £900 million to help people displaced by the Syrian crisis, making us the second largest bilateral donor in the world in response to that humanitarian crisis However, just as we are generous to those who need our help, the UK will be tough on those who flout our immigration rules or abuse our hospitality as a nation.",3
"Since 2010, the Government have introduced new laws to make it harder for people to live in the UK illegally, restricting their access to rented housing, bank accounts, driving licences, and our public services.",3
"We have revoked the driving licences of 11,000 illegal immigrants, closed down nearly 900 bogus colleges, and carried out over 2,900 sham marriage operations in the past year.",3
The new immigration Bill that we will bring before the House later this year will build on this work and enable us to take stronger action still.,3
"It will include measures to make it even more difficult for people to live in the UK illegally, make it easier for us to deport them, and make Britain a less attractive place for people to come and work illegally—not least by making illegal working a criminal offence in itself The approach of Her Majesty’s Government is clear.",3
"We do not know the circumstances of his death, what made him travel more than 3,600 miles to try to enter Britain, nor how much he paid to criminals who may have profited from his death The Home Secretary talked about the serious and growing challenge for hauliers, who are worried continually about the security of their load, whether people will try to break in and whether someone might be caught under their wheels, and about the holidaymakers who see people walking between the queuing cars and worry about the security of their boot, but this is a terrible crisis at our border in which lives are being lost and people are being injured I welcome the Home Secretary’s statement today, but it is not the first one that we have had and there have been urgent questions too.",3
Will she tell us how many additional staff the UK has deployed to Calais since last year and how many additional enforcement staff the French authorities have deployed Will the Home Secretary explain what is happening when people are found attempting to cross illegally?,3
What action has she taken to get a proper process in place in France to assess whether they have an asylum claim and are fleeing persecution or to assess their immigration status and whether they need to return home?,3
"Under the Dublin convention, it is their responsibility to assess those who may be vulnerable or who have asylum claims, and who should not be further victim to people traffickers or the despair that comes from being a vulnerable refugee travelling over large distances.",3
What is she doing to ensure that the French authorities are assessing those who are living in camps or on the streets in Calais before they make an attempt to reach the border?,3
"The Home Secretary talked about the work that is being done to tackle people smuggling more widely, but what is being done to make sure that immigration control and asylum process assessments take place in the southern Mediterranean countries too Finally, while it is crucial for us to strengthen border security to ensure that action is being taken in France to address this serious problem, we have a responsibility across Europe to deal with the humanitarian crisis that has been increasing the problem.",3
We all know of the pressure on families that are fleeing that situation The Prime Minister said that the UK Government would accept a “modest expansion” of the programme to accept Syrian refugees.,3
I have urged the Home Secretary many times in the House to accept far more UN refugees from Syria.,3
We have already increased funding for our police and intelligence services this year and legislated to give them stronger powers to seize passports and prevent travel.,3
That means breaking the business model of the smugglers by breaking the link between getting in a boat and getting a chance to arrive and settle in Europe.,3
"By contrast, focusing primarily on setting up a relocation scheme for migrants who have already arrived in Europe could, we believe, be counter-productive.",3
"Instead of breaking the smugglers’ business model, it makes their offer more attractive.",3
"We will, however, enhance our plans to resettle the most vulnerable refugees from outside the EU, most notably from Syrian refugee camps, in line with the announcement I made in Bratislava earlier this month Finally, on the UK’s relationship with the European Union, we have a clear plan of reform, renegotiation and referendum.",3
"At this Council, I set out the case for substantive reform in four areas: sovereignty, fairness, immigration and competitiveness First, on sovereignty, Britain will not support being part of an ever-closer union or being dragged into a state called Europe—that may be for others, but it will never be for Britain, and it is time to recognise that specifically.",3
"We want national Parliaments to be able to work together to have more power, not less Secondly, on fairness, as the eurozone integrates further, the EU has to be flexible enough to make sure that the interests of those inside and outside the eurozone are fairly balanced.",3
"Put simply, the single currency is not for all, but the single market and the European Union as a whole must work for all Thirdly, on immigration, we need to tackle the welfare incentives that attract so many people from across the EU to seek work in Britain Finally, alongside all those, we need to make the EU a source of growth, jobs, innovation and success, rather than stagnation.",3
"The issue is about sharing intelligence, the use of the internet and social media, cutting off finance, control of borders and co-ordinated military support to those fighting ISIL on the ground.",3
"Obviously, the Chancellor will say more about that shortly On migration, instability in north Africa and the middle east is a growing factor that is driving desperate migrants across the Mediterranean to Europe.",3
I ask the Prime Minister to confirm that the capacity and mandate of our action in the Mediterranean will not be diminished with the replacement of HMS Bulwark by HMS Enterprise We back the action against people trafficking to which the Prime Minister referred.,3
"Does he agree that EU action is needed to help southern European countries cope with those who are arriving, including support for a swift and robust asylum assessment, and help from other countries for those who are certified as refugees?",3
"Does he agree that Britain ought to offer to help some of those who are certified as refugees, just as we have done for vulnerable refugees from Syria, and just as we have done over the decades and, indeed, centuries, when we have provided sanctuary to refugees who have fled persecution and allowed them to make their future here with us On Britain’s negotiations with Europe, will the Prime Minister confirm that there is no prospect of any treaty changes being ratified before people vote in our referendum?",3
"Finally, we are an island, but whether it is the terrorism in Tunisia, Syria, Kuwait or France, whether it is the refugees in the Mediterranean, whether it is the economy in Greece, or whether it is the radicalisation of young people here at home, this week’s terrible events remind us emphatically once again that we are all interconnected.",3
"We will offer, and have already offered, to help southern European countries to process asylum seekers.",3
"We are drawing a distinction between resettling the most vulnerable refugees who are outside the European Union, for instance in Syrian refugee camps, for whom we think Britain can do more and—this is where I think the European Union is potentially heading down the wrong track—a relocation programme for migrants who are already within the European Union.",3
"I worry that such a programme would be counter-productive, and that, as I said earlier, it would reinforce the smugglers’ model of getting people here in the first place.",3
"They will be going ahead with their plans, but I think that what we should be doing is helping with the resettlement, and also pointing out that our asylum system has already given asylum to many people from the most vulnerable areas of the world, and continues to do so The right hon.",3
"There has to be no doubt that this is a human catastrophe, caused by those who are making billions out of illegal trafficking and smuggling individuals.",2
"It is important that the policies that we adopt deal, first, with the humanitarian approach, which is what HMS “Bulwark” is involved in—and, secondly, break that link between travelling on the boat to get here and the certainty of getting settled.",3
"If we can do that, we can break the smugglers’ grip on these people, for whose lives they care nothing.",3
"Scotland would need to contribute to areas such as defence, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and overseas aid, and it may be more difficult than it appears to delineate the ownership, let alone the size, of oil reserves and revenues.",3
The long and ridiculous battle to deport Abu Qatada more than illustrated the need in that regard.,3
"He was held by the courts to be a danger to the public, but more than 10 years after proceedings began the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights ruled that he could not be deported, on an argument that had been previously dismissed by the House of Lords.",3
"Human rights laws, and particularly the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights, have prevented the removal of many illegal immigrants and foreign criminals from the United Kingdom.",3
"They are looking for someone or something to shelter, insulate, protect and cushion them from these bewildering and often alien forces that are on occasion taking their livelihoods from them.",3
"They are looking for someone to hold responsible, and they are now being urged to turn what started off as an economic protest, rather than cultural prejudice, into a culture war whose main weapon is to blame foreigners, target immigrants and engender a siege mentality against the outsider.",3
"On Tuesday I was privileged to be a guest of the UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group, where 23 wonderful people who were seeking asylum or had been granted asylum in this country due to their sexuality were feeding back to me what had happened to them not only in their home country but, just as importantly, in the asylum process here in the UK.",3
I have to say that I was mortified when one female from Algeria talked about being detained for six months on the grounds that she was trying to claim asylum due to her sexuality.,3
"It is not illegal to be gay or lesbian yet this woman, fleeing her country, came here and was detained for six months I say to Ministers that on immigration issues around sexuality the Vine report still needs to be enacted.",3
It is a clear action plan for how we can provide security and safety yet also a clear asylum process for LGBT asylum seekers.,3
"What work is being done to further improve that co-ordination, particularly around asylum and LGBT rights internationally I turn to what happens worldwide.",3
"This is a request from the people in Istanbul: will our embassy fly the rainbow flag on the date of the next Istanbul Pride to show solidarity with people who wish to march next June and take pride in their sexuality Russia says that it is not illegal to be gay there, but its anti-gay propaganda laws promote a culture where people can actually persecute and violently abuse in the street lesbian and gay people who are standing up and being who they actually are.",4
The good one—there are things we get right on immigration—was that a lesbian woman fleeing persecution from Uganda was granted asylum only three days into our asylum system.,3
"However, another woman, who had to flee her family and go underground because she was not able to tell anyone about her sexuality, eventually came here; her case has been ongoing for over 18 months and she has still not been granted asylum.",3
"Interestingly, they suggested accepting more lesbian, gay and trans refugees fleeing persecution specifically by ISIS.",3
"Therefore, in the new wave of people whom we will take in and look after, and, I hope, grant asylum to, we should be aware of the sexuality of those fleeing being flung off roofs and stoned to death.",3
"That is the way of the world is for people in those countries This was another idea: “Remove accreditation from anti-gay foreign diplomats” I do not know whether that is possible, but it is one of the questions that has been asked.",3
"It is no good us pressuring a Government abroad to protect and give people equality in their human rights if we have not sorted out our own asylum system here, so we need to do that.",3
"If we are serious in our belief in equality, we should speak up for those beyond our borders.",2
"Today’s debate gives a real opportunity for the United Kingdom Government to underpin the steady support that they have given to the reform and modernisation of the Commonwealth and to ensure that the Commonwealth Secretariat takes a proactive approach and supportive role in promoting the reform of bad laws across the Commonwealth, starting with those that still criminalise gay men In 2011, President Obama and the then Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, identified championing the rights of LGBT people abroad as a foreign policy priority.",3
"In addition to the usual diplomacy with Governments, he believes that an essential part of his job will be to engage robustly, as we have heard today, with civil society organisations, foundations and businesses, both in the US and overseas, on promoting greater respect for the essential human rights of LGBTI people.",3
"As the noble Lord, Lord Scriven, said, giving people asylum is really important—giving them refuge from the terrible discrimination that they face.",3
Thomas was terrified and asked for asylum in the UK.,3
"He was granted status as a refugee and started to rebuild his life in the UK I repeat the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Scriven: will the Minister ensure that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office works across Whitehall departments, and through the United Kingdom Border Agency, to ensure that lesbian and gay people are provided with a real safe haven when they flee from such terrible persecution?",3
"My Lords, the best way to support member states under pressure is to break the link between getting on a boat in north Africa and being permitted to settle permanently in the EU.",3
"The UK is playing a leading role in EU efforts to tackle the people smugglers, address the upstream drivers of illegal immigration, and explore radical ideas to greatly reduce the likelihood of illegal immigrants being able to remain in the EU.",3
Some countries have attempted to maintain and police external borders; others have waved migrants through.,3
"The Schengen zone response is to establish hotspots in the countries where most are arriving so that they can be properly processed, and then have a mechanism for distributing migrants across the EU.",3
"We have maintained our borders while others have taken them down, and we are not participating in the quota system for migrants who have arrived in Europe.",3
"Instead, we are taking 20,000 Syrian refugees straight from the camps.",3
"It is still the case that the United Kingdom has spent more on aid for Syrian refugees than any other EU country—indeed, more than any other country in the world save the United States of America Secondly, the EU agreed in outline a new joint action plan with Turkey.",3
This includes potential additional financial support to help with the huge volume of refugees—more than 2 million in Turkey—and assistance with strengthening its ability to prevent illegal migration to the EU.,3
"While the terms of the EU’s assistance remain to be finalised, any visa liberalisation agreed under the action plan will not, of course, apply to the UK.",3
"We will continue to make our own decisions on visas for Turkish nationals Thirdly, we agreed more action to stop criminal gangs putting people’s lives at risk in the Mediterranean.",3
"The EU’s naval operation is now moving to a new phase, in which we can board ships and arrest people smugglers.",3
"Last week, the Commission published a new trade strategy that reflects the agenda that Britain has been championing for years, including vital trade deals with America, China and Japan, but more needs to be done in this area Thirdly, we need to ensure that the EU works for those outside the single currency, protects the integrity of the single market and makes sure that we face neither discrimination nor additional costs from the integration of the eurozone Fourthly, on social security, free movement and immigration, we need to tackle abuses of the right to free movement and deliver changes that ensure that our welfare system is not an artificial draw for people to come to Britain As I have said before, those are the four key areas where Britain needs fundamental changes, and there is a clear process to secure them.",3
"Already, we have ensured that British people can travel freely around Europe, but have at the same time maintained our own border controls.",3
"I will address briefly the context, the mischief that the Bill aims to address and a couple of final matters of clarification First, on the context, obtaining false identity documents enables criminals at all levels, from opportunistic criminals to those involved in immigration offences, serious organised crime and terrorism, to hide their tracks and evade detection.",3
"False documents might be used to obtain a bank account, which gives the first layer of a legitimate identity that could then enable illegal immigrants to merge into society and even to claim social security benefits to which they are not entitled However, there is a public safety aspect to false documents.",3
"On a visit this week to the specialist Metropolitan Police unit, Project Genesius, named after the patron saint of printing, I was shown numerous recent examples of illegal document factories which it has uncovered.",3
"Clause 2 defines “specialist” to cover the manufacture of relevant documents, which include passports and immigration documents, travel documents such as driving licences and blue badges, security passes, national insurance number cards, currency, credit cards, and birth, death and marriage certificates.",3
"It even includes those who make rubber stamps, as a false passport without a false UK immigration stamp can be useless Finally, there are a few matters of clarification.",3
"It is also important to note that false document factories are a cross-border problem, so the Bill will apply to the supply for the purpose of criminal activity occurring in any jurisdiction.",3
"The word is not defined in the Bill and will therefore have its dictionary definition, “willingness to allow or be secretly involved in an immoral or illegal act” Essentially, this is to cover implicit rather than explicit consent and will, I hope, cover those officers of companies or partnerships whose systems of reporting are so dilatory or are designed so as to avoid them knowing the information obtained by their salespeople or delivery drivers.",3
"As part of our strategy, the gracious Speech contains a counterextremism Bill, which will strengthen our powers to confront extremism and protect the public I turn now to the immigration Bill.",3
To cut net migration we need to ensure that we have a tough system that does not tolerate illegal migration.,2
"More than 800 foreign criminals are being deported under the “deport now, appeal later” measures, and the introduction of the immigration health surcharge means that migrants are now making a direct financial contribution to the NHS.",3
The immigration Bill will build on these reforms to complete the work of strengthening our controls against illegal immigration and supporting working people The gracious Speech also contained a commitment to bring forward legislation on communications data.,3
"On immigration, the Government will have to clarify how a number of proposals will work in practice.",3
"Of course we support measures to tackle illegal immigration and deport foreign criminals—but, again, the Government are tough on rhetoric and weak on action.",3
"Not only does it exclude illegal immigration, but the Government’s criteria would claim success when highly qualified professionals leave the UK to use their skills elsewhere and fee-paying foreign students choose not to come to the UK but instead go to study in China or the US.",3
"That would be a net fall in migration; a success for the Government, but of no help whatever to the UK or our economy In addition, around 500 fewer foreign criminals are being deported every year than under the last Labour Government, while at the same time we have seen substantial cuts in the UK Border Force.",3
"Mr Cameron may look very fetching to some in his police-issue Kevlar jacket as he joins the police on a raid to arrest exploited migrant workers, but that is no replacement for effective legislation.",3
"Those involved in terrorism, or in serious and organised crimes like drug and people trafficking, international fraud, hard core pornography, paedophilia and child sexual abuse, do so today with a sophistication and technical knowledge that many of us would struggle to comprehend Those who are victims of such crimes experience horrors that we can only imagine.",3
"It was no surprise at all to me that she was elected unopposed The last debate in the last Parliament was on indefinite immigration detention, a topic which certainly deserves further attention—but there are so many topics and so little time today.",3
"They are not something earned, and the term “deserve” has no place in our politics Reference is also made to “spurious” human rights and “bogus” asylum seekers—a similar kind of approach.",3
"Careless language can too easily validate xenophobia—and so, I fear, may some of the policies on immigration, but let us give them the benefit of the doubt and see what the detail is.",3
"Illegal working is already illegal, and seizing wages is unlikely to do more than to drive people further underground.",2
"Given the targets or ambitions for immigration numbers, it is ironic that the Conservatives talk up the problems of immigration.",3
"It must confirm a belief, which an awful lot of people hold, that the proportion of immigrants in our population is much higher than it actually is I accept that perceptions are important, and I accept the need to address the detail of people’s concerns; so, for instance, a requirement that recruitment agencies must recruit within the UK as well as abroad is sensible.",3
"It is natural, too, to resent immigrants pitching up and immediately claiming benefits, although I know that they do so much less than the indigenous community Our policy must not raise expectations about reforms that cannot be met.",3
"The Conservative manifesto refers to a visa system which puts British people first: “Across the spectrum, from the student route to the family and work routes” There are different views on how to achieve that.",3
"As one example, I believe—as I have said before, and will go on saying—that the family visa rules that do not support British citizens married to non-Britons with British children do not achieve this.",3
"Fluent English, which is also mentioned, is indeed a means to integration —I put it that way; not that a lack of it is a bar.",3
But that raises questions about the availability and accessibility of the teaching of English We talked about integration and community cohesion a good deal during the passage of the Counter-terrorism and Security Act.,3
"Can the Minister tell us what consultation is taking place, or will take place, on the construction of that strategy I hope we will be able to continue to address issues that we addressed in the previous Parliament, particularly on modern slavery, overseas domestic workers, supply chains and creating a tort of exploitation to allow for civil claims, which was dealt with in an amendment from the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey.",3
"My noble friend gave our support to the measures to tackle illegal immigration and to deport foreign criminals, and expressed concern about the lack of new measures to make it illegal to exploit migrant labour to undercut local wages and jobs Like many other noble Lords, my noble friend spoke about housing.",3
"Therefore there is potentially a very significant concentration of power under these proposals, but we need to be clear that having only one acceptable governance model—the elected mayor—is not a barrier to devolution We support the devolution and integration of health and care services but need to be satisfied about whether the model can be imposed on areas and whether it requires another structural upheaval.",3
I think that it boils down to just two issues: foreign prisoners and prisoner voting.,3
"Members will know that the Home Secretary famously tried to kick-start her own leadership bandwagon with a Tory conference speech in which she promised to deport an illegal migrant whose removal was said to have been blocked by the courts on the basis of article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which concerns the right to a family life.",3
"She said: “We all know the stories about the Human Rights Act...about the illegal immigrant who cannot be deported because, and I am not making this up, he had a pet cat.”",3
Please accept my congratulations on your re-election I want to bring to the House an opportunity to talk about the human rights situation in Burma/Myanmar and the migrant boat crisis that we have seen reported on in recent weeks in the media.,3
"We have seen heartbreaking coverage as thousands of Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshi migrants have remained stranded in squalor in smugglers’ boats at sea while initially Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia refused to allow them to land Some estimates suggest that 88,000 Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants have taken to the seas over the past 15 months.",3
"Indeed, between January and March this year 25,000 boarded smugglers’ boats, which is double the number for the same period in 2014.",3
"It was only after media reports and international pressure that the Thai, Malaysian and Indonesian authorities allowed migrants to arrive on their shores and, in recent weeks, between 3,500 and 4,000 have been allowed into Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia or have returned to Burma/Myanmar.",3
"I hope that the Minister will reflect upon that and perhaps say something when he responds to the debate The people traffickers had abandoned those boats, leaving those on board with no food or water.",3
The migrants were then refused sanctuary by the countries to which they were trying to escape.,3
"Yet many meet certain death; if they are not swallowed up by the south-east Asian seas, they are slung into mass graves when they eventually reach the Thai-Malaysian borders One migrant, Ziaur Rahamn, spoke to the Financial Times.",3
"Everywhere is killing and beating and trafficking, everywhere.” Today it is not clear how many migrants remain at sea in boats abandoned by the people traffickers; search and rescue vessels from Malaysia and Indonesia have not yet located any more migrant ships.",3
"So many of the boats have been abandoned as a tragic consequence of Thailand’s seeking—for entirely the right reasons, I emphasise—to stamp out its appalling record on people trafficking in the region.",3
"As a result, many of the smugglers, no longer able to bring people ashore, have resorted to abandoning boats or dumping their human cargo on islands near the coastline—essentially, they have killed some of their human cargo.",3
"The Thai authorities have found graves with 150 bodies along the Thai-Malaysian border, many thought to belong to Rohingya migrants The US and EU have criticised the authorities for failing to deal adequately with people trafficking.",3
"In recent months, the Thai authorities have arrested several Government officials, from army colonels to town mayors, thought to have been involved in people trafficking.",3
"Indeed, in the past 24 hours there have been reports of a senior major-general’s involvement in trafficking the Rohingya The problem is that no single Government in the region is prepared to show any leadership or take any real responsibility; it is no wonder that the UN has described the situation as a “massive humanitarian crisis”.",3
"Yes, it is welcome that the countries attending agreed to intensify search and rescue operations and that the Indonesians and Malaysians agreed to offer shelter to migrants—albeit temporarily and in the expectation that the international community will resettle them within a year.",3
"It refused to recognise that driving this issue is the persecution of the Rohingya people in Burma/Myanmar and the fact that to this day Burma/Myanmar refuses to recognise the citizenship of the Rohingya Like many Members here tonight, I have spoken before in the House about the citizenship issue and I will reiterate some of the points in a moment.",3
"If those nations want to launch a single economic market by the end of the year, as is their plan, does that not imply rules on movement of labour—and not trafficked labour with smugglers’ networks in which it seems Government officials are complicit?",3
"Member for Hampstead and Kilburn On 7 May this year, my constituency elected the daughter of a political asylum seeker.",3
Her story tells us that immigration is not simply an economic phenomenon.,3
"An ill-conceived net migration target that includes refugees and asylum seekers is, frankly speaking, immoral, and it should put us to shame In my constituency we have shown our welcoming attitude to migrants from Ireland and to refugees fleeing political persecution in Nazi Germany.",3
"I am proud to say that that tradition stands today in Salusbury World, the only refugee centre to be based in a primary school.",3
"In my constituency of Hampstead and Kilburn, we recognise the link between aspiration and immigration.",3
"We recognise that housing will be put under pressure, but we still recognise the benefits of immigration, and how it enriches us We believe that the Government should be able to take the benefits of immigration and ensure that it translates into prosperity.",3
Think about this: 46% of constituents in Hampstead and Kilburn are foreign-born.,3
"Without an open door to immigration, we might not have Hampstead and Kilburn.",3
"If we want Britain to remain open for business, we cannot shut the door of the shop My fear is that the EU referendum will become a proxy referendum on immigration.",3
"Yesterday I spoke to the Italian ambassador, Pasquale Terracciano, who told me that 92% of migrants crossing the Mediterranean leave from Libya.",3
"The refugees travelling from Libya consist largely of victims of war and conflict in Afghanistan, Syria, Eritrea, Nigeria and Somalia.",3
"We urgently need to support the UN mission to bring parties in Libya to the conference table One obstacle is the prevalence of criminal gangs in Libya, which play a large part in trafficking migrants from their points of origin into the Mediterranean.",3
"This was vividly demonstrated on 2 January, when 360 Syrian refugees, including 70 children, were rescued after the Ezadeen, a livestock freighter, was left adrift in freezing conditions Some of the groups profiting from this situation include international terrorist organisations such as ISIS, which recently captured territory in the city of Sirte.",3
Intelligence from Italy shows that trafficking has become a significant revenue stream for terrorist organisations to fund their activities.,3
Terminating these trafficking rings is vital.,2
"Will the Minister assure us that the Government are providing practical support to train Libyan security forces, disarm the militias and re-establish the rule of law Many of our EU partners believe that direct military action against the trafficking rings is necessary.",3
"The Government should provide direct support for more aggressive measures against the traffickers in international waters The Khartoum process, a commitment between the EU, north African countries and countries in the horn of Africa to co-operate in tackling people trafficking, appears to have had little impact.",3
"The Tunisian ambassador, Nabil Ammar, has provided me with information showing that his country’s security forces stopped 191 illegal migration attempts this year, detaining a total of 1,265 people.",3
"These centres would allow migrants to make asylum applications that are processed remotely outside Europe, preventing the migrants from risking their lives in the Mediterranean.",3
"The Government should review their current position against these centres, which present a legal alternative to refugees risking their lives in the Mediterranean.",3
We must review the implications of our foreign policy far more carefully.,3
"We can tinker with where and how asylum and immigration cases are processed, but stabilising the political and security situation in north Africa and the conflict zones is the only long-term solution We also need to contribute to the economic development of north African and sub-Saharan African countries.",3
"Everyone else loses: the desperate migrants in Lampedusa, Kos, Greece and Spain; the overstretched authorities and residents on the EU southern border; and the thousands of victims who have died in the Mediterranean, which has now become the graveyard of Europe.",3
We need to make it clear that illegal migrants who are not in genuine need of protection will swiftly be returned to their home countries.,3
We need to tackle the large organised crime gangs and trafficking networks who facilitate and profit from this human misery The increased flow of migrants has resulted in a range of pressures across Europe.,2
"This included £12 million from the UK Government towards upgrading the port infrastructure at Calais and other juxtaposed ports, and improving security and upgrading technology We have made good progress in the implementation of these practical solutions, including completing the first phase of installing new security fencing and a communications campaign from which we have obtained valuable intelligence and insights from migrants.",3
We welcome some of the EU’s proposals and we are working with other member states to deal with illegal migration.,3
"However, we have already made our position clear on the proposals for the relocation of migrants within the EU.",3
"Friend the Home Secretary is in Luxembourg today for the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting, which includes a strong focus on illegal mass migration.",3
"Through that fusion of intelligence from all sources, we will obtain the best possible picture so that we can take action against the trafficking gangs and vessels being used to transit people across the Mediterranean The UK is taking further action as part of a core group of EU member states and African partners, leading the EU Khartoum process—a combination of work by EU member states and African Union states, looking at the source and transit countries and at the people traffickers involved.",3
This horn of Africa initiative focuses on combating people smuggling and trafficking in the region.,3
"It will bolster sustainable regional protection for refugees by working with key countries of origin, including Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia, as well as transit countries such as Libya and Egypt The UK has also been at the forefront of efforts to secure a Security Council resolution to authorise the use of force against smugglers’ vessels.",3
"Some 187 have been resettled in the UK in just over a year, and more arrive each month Furthermore, we have granted asylum to more than 4,000 Syrians since the start of the humanitarian crisis there.",3
"The UK has already settled more than 6,000 refugees over the past 10 years in direct co-operation with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees under the Gateway programme.",3
"I hope to be able to answer one or two of the questions posed by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Stamford, within the context of this debate It is clear that European security must respond to new and changing threats, from terrorist outrages such as those in Paris, to which noble Lords have referred, to state-based threats such as Russia’s illegal annexation of the Crimea.",3
This strength is vital in promoting peace overseas.,3
"However, as noble Lords have recognised tonight, the threats we face do not recognise borders.",3
That is why we must indeed invest more in our alliances and make these relationships international by design—building our forces and capabilities in ways that complement and integrate with those of our allies.,3
People are prepared to share their experiences and enable me to meet the Armed Forces overseas.,3
EU sanctions on Russia have also been an important element in our response to the illegal annexation of Crimea.,3
"It is important to note that the US remains our pre-eminent partner for security, defence, foreign policy and prosperity.",3
"My Lords, I support Amendment 90, which would end the unacceptable situation regarding the current visa system for overseas domestic workers.",3
"As helpful as these may be, they do not tackle head-on the current desperate plight of many domestic workers who are subject to exploitation, slavery and forced labour The Government have had nearly a year since the pre-legislative scrutiny committee published its report in April 2014 to look into this and review the visa system for ODWs.",3
Time and again we have been told by the Government that there is insufficient evidence and that the numbers do not show that the 2012 visa changes have had any effect on the abuse that some overseas domestic workers have had to endure.,3
"As the noble Lord himself said, by that time this piece of legislation, excellent though it is, will be done and dusted The Joint Committee on the draft Bill said that since the tied visa was introduced there have been high levels of abuse among migrant domestic workers entering the UK.",3
"Some of these are welcome but, frankly, they are woefully inadequate and do not remedy the root of the problem—that is, untying the visas.",3
"The pilot visa interview programme in Africa might sound superficially attractive, but realistically these overseas domestic workers are not going to admit that their employer does not treat them well.",3
"Their employer is hardly going to tell them beforehand that they are going to work 19 hours a day, sleep on a floor, have little food, no pay and no access to their passport.",3
"To be effective, contracts of employment must be easily enforceable in the UK; but as the noble Lord himself has said, and as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said so forcefully in Committee, this is way out of the bounds of reality I welcome the reintegration plan with the FCO which will support overseas domestic workers who wish to return to their home country and rebuild their lives, but it does not help those who are currently enslaved.",3
Earlier this month the Court of Appeal found that diplomatic immunity trumped trafficking when it refused the claim of two domestic workers found by the UK’s national referral mechanism to have been conclusively trafficked by their diplomatic employers We are now on the last day of Report on this landmark Bill.,3
"My Lords, at the previous stage, I commented on the irony that the history of the arrangements for overseas domestic workers was a concession introduced for humanitarian reasons, so that the worker could accompany the family with whom they had been working and would not lose their job.",3
"In hearing the experiences that have been related to us, I found it particularly distressing and concerning to learn that a number of workers were informed that, if they were to escape and start work for someone else, they would be working illegally or would be here illegally if they did not approach the authorities.",3
"Virginia Mantouvalou in the work that she did in conjunction with Kalayaan reported in her conclusion that the single fear that interviewees who participated unanimously voiced, now that they were undocumented, was a fear of the authorities, of imprisonment and of deportation I agree that this is a matter for the rules but what is available to us is primary legislation because noble Lords do not take part in constructing immigration rules.",3
"As has already been mentioned, migrant domestic workers who are tied to their employers are particularly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.",2
The inability of overseas domestic workers to change their employer leaves them powerless to escape their abusive situation and to bring a case against their perpetrators.,3
"Instead of protecting victims, we have a current visa system that facilitates trafficking, undermining the very purpose of this Bill I regularly come into contact with families and individuals who have been victims of crime and injustice.",3
Those who do come forward are usually unaware of the visa rule.,3
"Many charitable organisations encounter clients who, after hearing that they have broken the conditions of their visa and are at risk of deportation, never return to them or consent to official help Kalayaan, the migrant domestic workers charity, provided me with some telling statistics.",3
"Expert organisations such as Kalayaan and Anti-Slavery International, and numerous parliamentary inquiries into this issue, have all concluded that this visa rule is one of the biggest barriers to support and justice.",3
Surely in the same way this Government can commit to protecting the rights of overseas domestic workers.,3
"I believe that Amendment 90, by reinstating the original migrant domestic worker visa, will empower these workers once again with the most basic rights and effectively protect them from abuse and exploitation.",3
"He has been very persistent on the issue—and rightly so because it is an area where we need to be absolutely convinced that we are on the right side of the argument However, given that this has been a wide-ranging debate, I think there is possibly a slight conflation of issues here: the overseas domestic worker visa and the treatment of people in domestic servitude who have been trafficked here from overseas.",3
"They are two distinct issues The overseas domestic worker visa was introduced by the previous Government in 1998 essentially to facilitate particular groups of people who travelled to the UK frequently, brought their own household staff and did not wish to hire people in the UK for short visits.",3
The average length envisaged then was a matter of a couple of weeks and today 15 days is the average time for which someone comes in.,3
"It may assist the House to know that about 80% of the people who come under the overseas domestic worker visa scheme come from a very small number of countries in the Middle East: 4,894 from the United Arab Emirates; 3,996 from Saudi Arabia; 2,581 from Qatar; 1,005 from Kuwait; and 257 from Oman.",3
A particular group uses the overseas domestic worker visa.,3
It was never intended that the overseas domestic worker visa should somehow translate itself into a visa to work for someone else.,3
"The amendment before us would open the opportunity for the visa potentially to be used as another way in which workers can enter the UK, repeat their application indefinitely and after a period of five years have the right to remain.",3
The overseas domestic worker visa is a particular issue which we are seeking to address.,3
"In 2012, we felt there was some evidence that the visa was being abused and that people were coming here with one employer and were being moved on to other employers and other areas.",3
"Therefore, we said that if you come in on that visa to work for that employer, you ought to stay with that employer I have set out what the overseas domestic worker visa is and how the discussion and debate is very different from the broader issues of trafficking which this legislation addresses.",3
"When Kalayaan, which I, like others, respect, undertook its review over a period of two years, there were some 32,000 overseas domestic worker visa applications.",3
Is it simply to revert to the previous visa regime or is it to take some interim steps?,3
"The contract must stipulate the sleeping arrangements, the minimum wage, the holiday pay and that the employer cannot withhold an individual’s passport.",3
"The person will now be interviewed by an officer directly and individually so that, should it be the case that when they were previously granted an overseas domestic worker visa to come to the UK they were not treated in accordance with their contract, then that could be made known and of course the visa would not be granted.",3
"If someone is on an overseas domestic worker visa and they feel their treatment by their employer is something amounting to servitude or abuse, they are able to come themselves to an organisation like Kalayaan or the police or the national referral mechanism.",3
"If they are on an overseas domestic worker visa or any other visa—or even here illegally within the UK—and they are being mistreated, that is not tolerated.",4
"Anyone who believes they are mistreated by their employers has access to a number of organisations who can help, including the police, ACAS, the pay and work rights helpline as well as the employment tribunals where the tribunal or the court has jurisdiction in their circumstances Although the overseas domestic worker visa is a scheme that is quite distinct from the general issues to which we are referring, we considered what would be the best way forward, given the concerns which had been raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and others.",3
"We said that we needed to have better information, not just about the treatment of overseas domestic workers but about the visa scheme itself.",3
"In other words, is the visa scheme which was introduced in 1998 still fit for purpose?",3
"In fact we are changing them tomorrow to reflect the changes to the overseas domestic worker arrangement which we have put in place—the new contracts, the requirement for an interview to take place and the testing and piloting of video links.",3
"It is whether we proceed with that amendment or whether we actually proceed in a more orderly way, recognising that we need to review the operation of this domestic workers visa arrangement and allow someone who is completely independent of government to undertake that review.",3
"Those threats range from habitat destruction and climate change to the illegal wildlife trade and poaching, which is threatening to decimate many species, as he pointed out Much of our ongoing effort to combat those threats is undertaken through work in the relevant international conventions, including the convention on biological diversity and the convention on international trade in endangered species.",3
This includes work in our overseas territories through the globally respected Darwin initiative.,3
"The illegal wildlife trade not only threatens the future existence of whole species; it devastates already vulnerable communities co-existing with these species, drives corruption and undermines our efforts to cut poverty.",2
"This illegal trade strikes at the very heart of our goals for good governance, for the protection of national and regional security, and for sustainable economic development The number of animals being poached is truly horrific.",2
"The price of ivory in China trebled between 2010 and 2014 Recognising the rapidly deteriorating situation, in February last year the Government hosted the London conference on the illegal wildlife trade.",3
"The conference delivered an ambitious political declaration containing 25 commitments to take action on, for example, reducing demand for illegal wildlife products, ensuring effective legal frameworks and deterrents across the globe, strengthening law enforcement and supporting sustainable livelihoods.",3
"Governments also committed to treating poaching and trafficking as a serious organised crime in the same category as drugs, arms and people trafficking In December last year, we announced funding for 14 projects as part of the illegal wildlife trade challenge fund, worth almost £4 million.",3
"That will help developing countries to tackle the illegal wildlife trade, and it is in addition to the five projects that we funded earlier in 2014.",3
He is undertaking engagements there in support of his work to combat the illegal wildlife trade and support wildlife conservation.,3
"Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs raised the issue of illegal wildlife trade during her recent visit to China at the beginning of this year.",3
"In Vietnam, the penal code is being amended to incorporate stronger and more deterrent sanctions against environmental crimes, including the illegal trade in endangered species UK enforcement bodies play an active role in combating wildlife trafficking, and I commend the excellent work of the national wildlife crime unit and the UK Border Force.",3
Members may recall a case last year of an interception at Heathrow of very rare San Salvador rock iguanas being smuggled from the Bahamas.,3
I therefore welcome the creation of an international taskforce to examine the role of the transportation industry in the trafficking of illegal wildlife products.,3
"The taskforce, including representatives from the global transport industry, will develop industry-wide protocols for the sector to strengthen measures it can take to help to eliminate this trafficking.",3
"Through the illegal wildlife trade challenge fund, the Government are supporting work such as the border point project, stopping illegal wildlife trade in the horn of Africa.",3
We are also providing funding to the Born Free Foundation to improve enforcement by sending experts to border points to increase the knowledge and skills of local officials The right hon.,3
"He asked about the serious and organised crime strategy, and I can confirm that it does cover the illegal wildlife trade.",3
"I remind my noble friend Lord Tugendhat that there are probably just as many EU citizens living in the United Kingdom as there are British citizens living in the EU, and therefore in the inevitable negotiations that will take place after a decision to leave—if such a decision is made—something will need to be done to cater for these people so that they can travel without visas between both countries I also remind my noble friend that we are not part of the Schengen agreement, so there is not free movement of citizens directly from the EU into the United Kingdom.",4
"They have to show their passports, which they do not have to do when crossing borders in the EU, as we have discovered through the inordinately large number of immigrants now coming into the EU I also want to pick up on the point about the timing made by the noble Lord, Lord Shipley.",4
"I beg to move, That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision about the award of asylum seeker status in the United Kingdom to certain unaccompanied children from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Eritrea displaced by conflict and present within the European Union; and for connected purposes Just over three months ago, the tragic death of a little boy and his brother exposed the world to a refugee crisis that Governments, including our own, had been doing their best to avoid.",3
"Both were Syrian refugees travelling with their parents to seek safety and sanctuary in Europe The latest figures for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees show that more than 900,000 people have made similar journeys, over sea, to Europe this year and that 23% of them were children.",3
"Others have lost their family members en route through illness or drowning In their desperation, these children put themselves in the hands of people smugglers and criminal gangs to facilitate their journeys.",3
"There are serious concerns, which have been echoed by Europol’s Chief of Staff Brian Donald, that vulnerable, underage refugees are being preyed on by organised criminal gangs intent on forcing them into prostitution and slave labour.",3
"Mr Donald also warned that there is a “tremendous amount of crossover” between those smuggling refugees across borders and the gangs trafficking people for exploitation in the sex trade or as forced labour When we start to look at the data from last year, the grim truth becomes apparent.",3
"We do not yet have comparable numbers for 2015, but given the rise in refugees this year, we can expect a much higher number of disappeared children This is not a far-off problem to be dealt with by distant Governments.",3
"It is our responsibility to protect all refugees, and none more so than orphaned children with no other hope.",2
"Given the opportunity, British people have shown again and again throughout history our generosity of spirit, especially in response to refugees.",4
Matching profiles found at crime scenes in the UK against the four overseas databases saw an impressive 118 hits.,3
"Crucially for the police, this is leading to the arrests of foreign nationals that would not otherwise have taken place—foreign criminals whom we can then kick out of the country, making our streets safer A DNA crime scene profile recovered from an attempted rape was sent to all four Prüm pilot countries.",3
"As the director general of the National Crime Agency, Keith Bristow, has said, “these would not have been detected without the pilot” It is because of cases like this that Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, has said that Prüm will: “reduce the number of unsolved crimes, such as murder and rape, committed by foreign nationals, and provide an improved service to the public, victims and their families”.",3
"If the House votes to re-join Prüm, we will be setting in place a process that will catch foreign nationals who have committed crimes here.",3
We will be setting in place a process by which these criminals can be deported.,3
We will be setting in place a process by which foreign nationals who have committed crimes in the UK can be linked to crimes abroad and sent to those countries to stand trial.,3
"In short, it will be a vote to keep foreign criminals off our streets and make our communities safer The numbers here are stark.",3
"That is up to 8,000 foreign criminals our police can track down for crimes they have committed in the UK.",3
Countries signed up to Prüm can also check the EU database containing the fingerprints of asylum seekers and others detained illegally crossing the EU’s borders.,3
"With the unprecedented flows of migrants at the moment, it is clear that the police would benefit from having this capability.",3
One reason we opted back into SIS II was to give our immigration officials the opportunity to deal with these issues as people crossed the border.,3
"As I said, it is possible to check the EU database for the fingerprints of asylum seekers and others detained crossing the EU’s borders illegally.",3
"Where there have been genuine concerns, I have listened The first concern I have heard about this system is that innocent Britons could get caught up in overseas investigations.",3
"The Government should think again about the refugees from Syria who have arrived in Britain whom they are deporting back to other European countries, even though those countries may already have taken far more Syrian refugees than we have.",3
"That is not about Britain doing its bit to help, particularly given the scale of the crisis we face We need a plan for Europe, not just a Marshall plan for the region, because people will keep trying to reach our shores, whatever we do—a plan that involves proper UNHCR-run assessment centres in the region before people try to make a dangerous journey, and EU funding for the UN to do the job; a plan that funds assessment centres in Europe in the places people are most likely to arrive, so that they do not start to travel in dangerous convoys across our continent; a swift system to respond to those economic migrants, perhaps from the Balkans, who need to return and to follow normal immigration rules; a plan to help the refugees get the help and support they need; a plan that takes on the vile criminal gangs; a plan in which European countries work together, rather than making life harder for each other; a plan by which the French authorities and the UN can do full assessments of those at Calais to determine how many are refugees and how many need support; a plan in which Europe stands strong in the face of the crisis in which it is being tested, rather than falls apart Why is Britain not leading the way in insisting on the scale of plan that we need?",3
"Imagine how much harder it would be, whether to deal with the problems at Calais or the problems of people crossing borders through the continent, if we were to rip Europe apart and make it harder to work together In the end, this is about the kind of Britain we are and the kind of Europe we want to believe in.",2
"In the 1930s, despite the recession and hardship our country faced, we took in more than 80,000 Jewish and European refugees In the Kindertransport debate 77 years ago, Philip Noel-Baker reminded parliamentarians of our common past.",3
"In his speech, he reminded the House of the Russian refugees after the first world war who were resettled in Greece, Bulgaria and Syria.",3
"Here is what Samuel Hoare, the Conservative Home Secretary of the day, told the Commons: “There is no page in our lifetime which is so tragic as that of the sufferings of the refugees…Wave after wave of refugees has drifted across the world, uprooted from their homes, penniless, destitute, no country found ready at hand to receive them, separated from their families and their surroundings”.—[Official Report, 21 November 1938; Vol.",3
"Just let me get into my stride Instead, those who are refugees should be offered a well-resourced place of safety—perhaps in Europe, but more probably in a safe place in the region where they live—and if it turns out that someone is an economic migrant, they should be taken home.",3
"As I see it, it is the only way to slow the number of bodies landing on the beaches and to allow Europe to re-establish control of its borders, which it has now lost.",3
"There are big disparities in security and economic opportunities between nations, and they will not be solved by short-term measures, such as giving hundreds of thousands of people asylum within Europe.",3
The numbers have grown and will grow as long as we continue to reward these journeys with the opportunity to settle in Europe Let us be hard-headed about this: not all migrants are refugees.,3
"By way of illustration, Al Jazeera reporting from the Greek side of the border with Macedonia showed that large numbers of Syrians were trying to dissociate themselves from people from other places.",3
"It said: “They want to separate themselves from the other nationalities; the Pakistanis, the Afghans, the Iraqis...what they say is that all these other nationalities claim to be Syrians as well, because it is the Syrians who have the most valid claim to asylum.” When populations flee war or famine, they generally flee together, as I saw as a television reporter and a soldier.",3
The current migrants are overwhelmingly working-age males who have paid a hefty price to make the trip.,3
"It costs thousands to board a smuggler’s boat and a lot of money in the months before to travel to it As a TV reporter in the 1990s, I remember doing a piece about landlords in north London ripping off the housing benefit system.",3
"Living side by side with people in the camp, it seemed to me that the overwhelming majority of the people who got as far as Calais were economic migrants.",3
"In many cases, their families had sold land to get the money to pay the people smugglers, and they had travelled to northern France unchecked.",3
"Friend the Prime Minister, by trying to support as many Syrian refugees as possible through helping the many, as opposed to the few—helping all those camped out across Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and elsewhere.",3
"That would be better than focusing on a lucky minority who will get to Europe Back in May, the European Commission made the insane proposal that member countries should take in migrants and refugees under a quota scheme.",3
"Notwithstanding other comments that he has made, Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, noted at the time: “The proposal on the table from the European Commission…is absurd, bordering on insanity… It is an incentive for human traffickers and will simply tell people: yes, try to cross the Mediterranean at all costs.” Our Government rightly ruled out the EU asylum policy as an open invitation to uncontrolled immigration.",3
"If it does not want to control its borders then it should establish a sea bridge across the Mediterranean, let everyone in who wants to come, and not let these people die.” Let us not forget that there are some very wealthy Sunni states with dogs in the Syrian fight.",3
The UK has taken just 1% of the world’s refugees.,3
It is not an easy challenge to accept people and be able to integrate them.,2
I am proud that that is not a one-off—we have set up our own migrant welcoming centre.,3
"Walthamstow means welcome; it is what we do in my community I know that it is a hard question to answer when the voices of the persecuted are sometimes quiet and vulnerable, by comparison with the other voices we hear, such as the headlines that say, “Halt the asylum tide now”, “Draw a red line under immigration or else” or “The swarm on our streets”, or calls for deployment of the Army against the people that the hon.",3
"We cut the funding for Operation Mare Nostrum, thinking that somehow that would stop the boats.",3
"The boats came anyway, and the lorries are still running.",3
"Think of the men who might fail school exams or lose jobs and who we will not give visas to—men like Einstein, or the father of Steve Jobs.",3
"There is no speech we can make here, no threat we can make to those boats and no lesson we can learn from Australia that will override the enduring wish of every parent to give their child that kind of future If we do not hear those voices, the question is not about them; it is about us.",3
The problem is not refugees or migrants; the problem is politicians not doing their job.,2
"If we want to stop the boats and lorries, that is what we must do I want to make a final plea to the Home Secretary.",3
Will the Home Secretary please join me in calling for the VAT on that charity single to be waived so that the money can be used to help the refugees?,3
"The news we read, the images we see and the stories we hear of the refugee crisis are, all too often, heartbreaking.",2
"They have brought the events in Syria once again to the forefront of our minds Eighteen months ago, I travelled to Turkey with some other Members of this House to visit one of the camps on the Turkish-Syrian border.",3
"The one I visited was home to 17,000 refugees or guests.",3
"In many ways they too are refugees, but refugees in their own home Current figures show there are 16.2 million people in need of humanitarian aid.",3
"Here we are, many months later, facing this ongoing and worsening situation We must not let those refugees down.",3
"Last year, the UK received 25,000 applications for asylum, just over 2,000 of which were from Syria.",3
"Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis back in 2011, the UK has granted asylum to about 5,000 Syrians.",3
"Yesterday’s statement from the Prime Minister proposed that Britain would settle a further 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next five years.",3
We are the second biggest bilateral donor in the world to Syria and Syrian refugee camps.,4
"Our contribution is significant and it is right that we make it We must not let the refugees down, but we must not give in to terror.",3
We must not do anything that encourages trafficking and we must not encourage people to make those perilous sea crossings.,2
It is vital to be able to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants.,2
"I am sure that the Minister will say more about Britain’s historical links to the region later In the short time since I made my initial application to the Backbench Business Committee, there have been numerous developments that are relevant to the topic of this debate: a Russian passenger plane blown out of the sky over the Sinai peninsula, a suicide terrorist attack in Beirut, more lives lost in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the first full parliamentary elections in Egypt since the second revolution, the deadly bomb attack in Tunisia, the tragic events in Paris, the downing of a Russian jet on the Syrian-Turkish border by the Turkish air force, the unanimous passing of United Nations resolution 2249, an increase in anti-Semitic attacks across Europe and violent clashes with UK Muslim communities, including two attempts to torch Finsbury Park mosque this weekend alone.",3
"Tribal and ethnic loyalties, cultural ties, religious differences and centuries-old conflicts, most of which transcend national borders, all bedevil the region.",2
Changing borders have resulted in diverse communities within national borders.,3
"This is not just about immediate questions of foreign policy or military action; it is about our future way of life, how we educate our children, how we welcome and integrate immigrants and refugees, and how we teach respect and loyalty for our country, values, traditions and laws.",2
"The Gallipoli of the past could be a provincial shopping centre of tomorrow, and until we stop our society breeding new generations of radicalised young people, until we stop sheltering those who wish our society ill, and until we achieve a fully integrated society in which values are shared, laws are respected, and loyalty to Queen and country is separate from loyalty to a religion, we will not be secure.",2
"In some cases, we are already seeing the effects in Libya and with the recent refugee crisis.",3
"The British Council is doing good work on those areas, particularly in the refugee camps around the Syrian border.",3
I would love to see how many stamps he has in his passport—but it is the EU so there will be no stamps.,3
Member for Stone talked about legal migration and the issues confronting the British electorate—issues that we need to discuss—but I want to concentrate on illegal migration.,3
"On a recent visit to Calais, the Home Affairs Committee accepted the point made by the Mayor of Calais that once illegal migrants get there, they can see the UK and it is therefore already too late.",3
"It is too late, once the illegal migrants get to Calais; this issue needs to be dealt with by the EU and the Commission at the point of departure from north Africa As my right hon.",3
"In the past five years, the Committee has also visited the border between Greece and Turkey.",3
"Once they arrive in Greece, they are kept in detention for up to three to four months, before being released on the border between Greece and Turkey.",3
"It requires a new deal with the countries of north Africa, particularly in respect of how the Egyptians, Libyans, Algerians, and to a lesser extent the Moroccans and Tunisians, deal with the people traffickers, who take up to €10,000 each from each migrant on the boat and then leave them, sometimes without a captain, in the hope that the Italian Government will send ships to save them, which does not always happen.",3
"So although it is not necessarily on the conscience of people sitting in this House, it is certainly on the conscience of the Commission, if it has one Dealing with illegal migration requires an EU approach; it is not just a matter for the United Kingdom.",3
"As I have said, once the migrants have reached Calais, it is far too late.",3
"Gentleman is prepared to do another five years—what is happening in the EU with illegal migration, because it is a huge problem that needs to be resolved.",3
"A person who has lived in any other country as a British citizen for up to 15 years has a right to register as an overseas voter, although, despite the efforts of political parties, very few people do.",4
"It quoted one of its members, who says: The In/Out Referendum has the very real and very frightening possibility of making me an illegal immigrant overnight.",3
Will I be able to/forced to claim political asylum?,4
"They include individuals who are assessed by the Secretary of State as posing a direct threat to the security of aircraft; individuals who are subject to a temporary exclusion order, which we have talked about previously in our debates on the Bill; EEA nationals and accompanying/joining third-country national family members of EEA nationals who are the subject of an exclusion or deportation order under the immigration regulations; third-country nationals who have been, or are in the process of being, excluded from the UK under the Immigration Rules; nationals who are the subject of a deportation order; nationals who have been or would be refused a visa; and individuals otherwise inadmissible to the UK, including those seeking to travel using invalid travel documents.",3
"We already work closely with foreign Governments and airlines, as well as UK operators, to make sure that the necessary security measures are in place and are being effectively implemented, but these measures will enhance our ability to do that I hope your Lordships will therefore agree that it is right and sensible to have these strengthened and clarified powers available at the earliest opportunity.",3
The Home Secretary has ducked the specific question of whether she wants overseas students to have to leave the country before they can apply for any high-skilled job in Britain.,3
"I hope that means that she is backing away from the policy and that it was simply a proposal from her special advisers—that is obviously why they have been banned from the Tory candidates list The Home Secretary needs to reflect on all her immigration policies because border checks have got weaker, asylum delays have risen by 70%, low-skilled migration is up, and her net migration target is in tatters, but the numbers of overseas university students fell last year.",3
"Criminals have been given citizenship, the Syrian scheme has been delayed, yet the Home Secretary claimed that her immigration policy is an achievement to be proud of.",3
Will she tell the House whether she is proud of targeting postgraduates while illegal immigration gets worse?,3
How proud is she of giving killers British citizenship while Syrian refugees are refused entry?,3
"She mentioned human trafficking in her speech, but not immigration—I know she cannot mention everything on Second Reading.",3
"When the Committee went to Calais and talked to some of those vulnerable migrants who had made their way from Eritrea, through north Africa and across the Mediterranean and into Calais, we were struck by the numbers who had paid to go there.",3
There is big money in immigration and illegal migration.,2
Those who profit manage to get away with the fact that it happens beyond our borders.,3
"I am not sure that the Bill deals with the issue—it was raised by the Metropolitan police commissioner with the Select Committee and, no doubt, with the Home Secretary—of those convicted of very serious offences who complete their sentence, leave prison, are given their passports and are then allowed to leave the country without their fines being realised, and so hang on to their proceeds.",3
"He was right to be concerned, because people come out of prison, get their passports and leave the country with the proceeds of crime still somewhere within their empire.",3
"Specifically, she led a parliamentary inquiry into the effectiveness of legislation in tackling child sexual exploitation and trafficking.",3
I am grateful to her for agreeing to meet me and a small group to discuss the increasing problem of illegal immigration.,3
I am afraid that the reply was what one might expect from an official civil service reply—I am probably guilty of signing many such myself in the past—and it told me how wonderful the Border Force is at stopping illegal immigrants and that it was doing all that it could.,3
"As I said earlier, we are not expecting landlords to be immigration experts.",3
"Under the 2014 Act, we took necessary steps to prevent people in the UK illegally from setting up current accounts with banks and building societies.",3
The Bill will expand on these measures by creating an obligation for banks and building societies to carry out periodic checks on the immigration status of current account holders.,3
"When an account holder is identified as in the UK illegally, following a court order the account can be frozen or closed by the bank or building society Parts 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill are about removing from the UK people with no right to be here.",3
"Immigration officers already do an excellent job of enforcing our laws and where appropriate removing people who are in the UK illegally, but we must do more.",2
"The 2014 Act shows that “deport first, appeal later” works when foreign criminals make human rights claims.",3
"The Bill will also ensure that when foreign criminals are released on bail, we can satellite tag them so that we know their whereabouts, and thus better protect the law-abiding majority When people have no right to be in the UK, we expect them to leave, but some people are being sent the wrong message.",3
The Bill reflects the Government’s commitment to providing support for destitute asylum seekers in line with our international obligations.,3
"However, those with no right to be here are expected to return home and the Bill will restrict the support we give to people who are here illegally Part 6 is about protecting our borders.",3
It is imperative that we have control over our borders and know who is coming into the UK.,2
"Today we have published a consultation on the code of practice that public bodies will have to comply with, and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House Part 8 establishes a new immigration skills charge for businesses bringing workers into the country.",3
"Currently, many businesses are hiring workers from overseas, rather than taking the long-term decision to train our workforce here at home.",2
"We need to discourage a default position of looking overseas to fill the skills gap, and the Bill will remedy that by introducing a charge for employers recruiting from outside the European economic area, which will encourage businesses to source skilled labour from the domestic workforce.",3
"The funds raised from the charge will contribute to training domestic workers and, in particular, to funding apprenticeships Fixing the immigration system cannot be done overnight.",3
"We must act now to stop rogue landlords and people smugglers exploiting vulnerable people, to protect our public services from abuse and to ensure that people with no right to be in this country are not allowed to extend their stay.",3
"This Bill will build on the progress made through the 2014 Act, ensuring greater fairness for British citizens and legitimate migrants, and making sure that the law comes down firmly on the side of those who abide by our laws and play by the rules.",3
"I beg to move, That this House, whilst affirming its belief that there should be firm and fair controls on illegal immigration including new immigration enforcement powers and immigration status checks on current account holders, and particularly welcoming proposals for a Director of Labour Market Enforcement and to strengthen sanctions to be applied to employers of illegal workers, declines to give a Second Reading to the Immigration Bill because the measures overall in the Bill will not decrease illegal immigration, will reduce social cohesion and will punish the children of illegal immigrants for their parents’ illegal immigration, because the Government has failed to publish the report on the pilot Right to Rent scheme in the West Midlands which could cause widespread indirect discrimination and because the Bill enables the Home Secretary to remove from the UK migrants who are appealing against a refused asylum claim before the appeal has been determined, notwithstanding the slow appeal process and the high error rate in Home Office decisions Let me start by setting this debate in an essential and important piece of context and with a point that the Home Secretary skated over at the start of her speech: the most recent evidence is clear—immigration provides a net benefit to our economy.",3
That migrants contribute more to the public purse than they take out is a simple fact that cannot be repeated often enough in debates such as this.,3
"Similarly, in the NHS, we are far more likely to be treated by a migrant than to stand behind one in a queue.",3
"The culture and identity of our country—for centuries an open, outward-looking, seafaring nation—has itself been shaped by centuries of inward immigration, and it is all the richer for it.",4
"I stood alongside him and he said no such thing, so I will move on from that pointless intervention A number of organisations—Amnesty International, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Justice, the TUC and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants—have expressed serious reservations about the Bill.",3
"They believe it could damage social cohesion, force children into destitution, undermine efforts to tackle human trafficking and modern slavery, erode human rights and civil liberties, and lead to widespread discrimination Let me take those issues in turn, starting with the potential for discrimination.",2
"Clause 12 in part 2 amends the Immigration Act 2014 to make it a criminal offence for a landlord to rent premises to an individual with no immigration status, punishable by five years in prison.",3
"First, landlords are not border or immigration experts, they are not trained in reading official paperwork from around the world, and they are not experts in spotting forged documents, so on what basis are we planning to outsource immigration control to them?",4
"We know that right to rent could cause widespread discrimination, not just against migrants but against British citizens.",2
"In the absence of the Government’s study, an independent survey was carried out by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants.",3
"It found that in the west midlands, the pilot area, 42% of landlords said that right to rent had made them less likely to consider someone who does not have a British passport, while 27% were now more reluctant—as my hon.",3
Friend the Member for Brent North (Barry Gardiner) has said—to engage with those with foreign accents or names.,3
"It has been a habit in the field of immigration to take the approach that if at first you don’t succeed, legislate and legislate again.",3
"The notion of criminalising a person for working is controversial, especially given that prosecutions are already possible for breaches of immigration law under section 24 of the Immigration Act 1971, as the hon.",3
"We believe strongly that the speculative possibility of shaving a small amount off the net migration target will be outweighed by the significant danger highlighted by organisations that work with victims of trafficking, and that some of the most vulnerable workers will be put in an even more vulnerable position.",3
"The Home Secretary and the Government have done good work on trafficking, slavery and exploitation, and it would be sad if that were to be undone by pushing exploited workers even further underground because of the fear of criminalisation.",3
"If that is the effect, such measures will make immigration and labour market enforcement harder rather than easier Another area where dangers outweigh speculative benefits concerns the right to rent provisions.",3
The shadow Secretary of State referred to the helpful study by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants.,3
"More significantly, those findings suggest that landlords are—perhaps understandably—less likely to consider someone who does not have a British passport, which includes more than one in six of the UK population.",3
"We are equally opposed to the fact that the new more punitive measures—and indeed other measures on licensing—can be extended to Scotland by subordinate legislation without full parliamentary scrutiny in this Chamber, and without the consent of the Scottish Parliament, where decisions on housing should be made We have serious concerns about part 3 of the Bill which, in combination with other measures, would deliver a stunning extension of powers to immigration officers and others who are not part of the police force, and not trained or supervised accordingly.",3
"Although we intend to support the reasoned amendment, we have some difficulties with this area, and it would be useful if, when winding up the debate, the spokesperson for the official Opposition said a little more about what new enforcement powers they want The Bill provides immigration officers with significant new powers to enter premises, search, seize, retain and arrest, and all in the face of serious reported abuses and evidence of the inefficient exercise of existing powers.",3
"We saw in September that there is widespread cross-party support in this Chamber for changes to immigration detention, but those are not the changes in the Bill.",3
That cross-party support included demand for a 28-day time limit for immigration detention.,3
"Let us remember that huge numbers of these appeals are successful, yet they will become infinitely more difficult if appellants are moved hundreds, if not thousands of miles away from their lawyers and their appeal hearing—an unfair immigration trial in absentia.",3
"UK citizens will be affected, because if this issue principally concerns family life appeal rights, that disruption will be to family life with those British citizens—families will be split apart; valuable jobs and support will be lost Finally, we object to the fact that “destitution” is once more the immigration policy of choice in part 5 of the Bill.",3
"The shadow Secretary of State rightly acknowledged a similar pilot project by a previous Labour Government, which found that 35 out of 116 families had disappeared, losing all contact with immigration services.",3
"Such measures make immigration control harder, not easier.",2
We should go back to the drawing board to consider how we measure a successful immigration system.,3
"At the very least we should recognise that it is utterly inappropriate to include refugees, people’s husbands, wives and children, as well as bright young talent and the leaders of tomorrow who want to come here to study.",3
"We should roll back the financial thresholds imposed on spouse and partner visas that are driving couples apart and creating what the Children’s Commissioner for England has called “Skype families”, and we should end the routine use of immigration detention We should address the concerns and challenges that can be caused by migration trends, and instead of scrapping schemes such as the migration impacts fund we should look at improved versions.",3
Let devolved nations and regions have powers on immigration.,3
"It is not because they have tickets, visas and passports to come here; it is because they are seeking to enter the country illegally.",2
"In doing so, it is clearly evident they are endangering their lives and the lives of other people who use those services too The people in the camps have the right, if they want help, to claim asylum where they are.",2
The people who have the most to fear from the Bill are those who seek to exploit migrants coming to this country without papers.,2
Migrants have been told not to claim asylum and that they will be looked after privately and secretly once they get here.,3
It is the exploiters who have the most to fear from the Bill I very much welcome the work the Home Office has done to try to secure our borders.,3
Our first obligation is to protect the border itself.,2
"The investment the Government have made, along with the French authorities, in securing our border at Calais and Coquelles is hugely significant and hugely welcome.",3
It has greatly reduced the numbers of migrants seeking to enter the country illegally by storming the entrances to the channel tunnel and the port of Dover.,3
I also welcome the moves passed recently by the French Senate—they are still going through the French National Assembly—to improve French law enforcement capabilities to deal with people seeking to enter this country illegally by storming the frontier at Calais and Coquelles.,3
"It is right to protect the migrants and to protect our frontier, and it is right that these important new sanctions are being considered.",3
"We want a robust immigration system where people with the right to come to this country can do so, and we want to open this country to the world.",2
"We want a system where legitimate asylum seekers and refugees are granted safety and refuge, which has been a great hallmark of this country for many years We do not, however, want a system where people traffickers and smugglers from around the world can say, “If you get into the UK, you won’t be detected.",3
It aims to protect a legitimate migration system and to enhance Britain’s reputation as a country that welcomes refugees and people coming to work here but which conducts proper checks on people to make sure they have the right to stay and are legitimate asylum seekers.,4
"We are a city of diversity and integration, and the two go together The hon.",3
"Recently in my constituency, an organisation has been set up by people of Romanian origin to integrate further into this country.",3
This is a country of diversity that ever since the Romans has had people of overseas origin becoming part of its functioning.,4
"The United Nations High Commission for Refugees says that landlords are less likely to rent to those with foreign accents or names, or those who do not possess a British passport.",3
They never learned to speak English fluently; they never got British passports —yet they were part of this country and part of a community.,3
"People coming here as refugees are scared stiff for their lives—something that, thank God, we in this country are not—and are subjected to all kinds of interrogation.",2
"Like many, if not most, Members, I was acutely aware long before the general election of just how important the issue of immigration had become to the people in this country.",3
"Of all the issues raised with me on the doorstep by my constituents, immigration was unquestionably the number one concern, and scenes throughout the summer, across Europe and in Calais, have done nothing but exacerbate that concern in recent months Like my right hon.",3
"My constituents are absolutely clear about the fact that they want us to control our borders, and that includes dealing with those who have already managed to evade our border controls While there are, of course, many benefits to Britain from some controlled immigration, we must face the fact that the current levels are unsustainable.",3
It is well documented that mass immigration forces down wages and makes it more difficult for residents like mine to find work.,2
"However, illegal immigration is the major source of frustration and grievance for my residents.",2
I therefore welcome the Bill’s attempts to support working people by clamping down on illegal immigration.,3
"It is right that we make it an offence for anyone to employ someone whom he or she knows, or has reason to suspect, is an illegal worker.",3
"The Bill sends a clear message to those gangs: “You will not win.” It also sends a clear message to potential illegal migrants that it will not be as easy to establish themselves in the United Kingdom as they were promised it would be Since 2010 the Government have worked hard to support new businesses, many of which have been set up in my constituency.",3
"Equally, we must punish those who continue to flout the law by employing illegal labour and giving themselves an unfair and illegal competitive advantage.",2
"Businesses that ignore the law should be closed, and those who run them should be prosecuted, and seen to be prosecuted, for their actions Legal immigrants can make, and often have made, an enormous and valuable contribution to our society, but there is no doubt that illegal migration, and even the current levels of legal migration, have an adverse effect on our most important public services.",2
They naturally feel that it is just plain wrong if even part of the reason for that is illegal workers taking up private rental properties.,2
"I also think that if large firms or public sector organisations cannot find people in Britain with the necessary skills and have to employ someone from abroad, they should also have to provide an apprenticeship for a British youngster so that we can train up the next generation of British people as well At the last election, we also proposed tougher measures to tackle the illegal exploitation of foreign workers, and the creation of a new Home Office unit to enforce the law, so I support the Bill’s proposals for a director of labour market enforcement and for stronger sanctions against those who employ illegal workers.",3
"I have always thought that if you want to live in Britain you must be prepared to work hard and pay your way, obey the law and learn to speak English, because there is no other way to play a full role in British society, so it is right that the Bill will make it easier to monitor foreign nationals who have broken the law and to ensure that customer-facing public workers speak fluent English.",3
"Most people will think it is also completely right that the Bill proposes to tackle illegal immigration and its links with organised crime, people trafficking and exploitation, which have a knock-on effect on our communities, on wages and on public services As we heard earlier, however, the Government have not yet provided any evidence that the trial of plans to intensify the right to rent scheme, which requires landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants, has cut illegal migration.",3
I do not think that reasonable people would support a measure that could prevent British people who have worked and contributed to this country for decades from finding a home just because they have a foreign-sounding name or a different accent The Government must go much further to enforce the minimum wage so that unscrupulous employers cannot exploit foreign labour to cut costs and drive down wages.,3
"I want bigger fines for breaking the rules, and a ban on recruitment agencies hiring solely from overseas.",3
People in Dudley also want to see tighter border controls.,3
"We proposed to introduce a levy on US visitors to pay for 1,000 extra border guards and to do more to strengthen checks for illegal immigrants in Calais I would like to see the Government acknowledge that the costs and benefits of immigration are not shared equally across the United Kingdom.",3
"However, immigration can clearly put pressure on public services such as housing, schools and the NHS.",3
That could be funded by the benefits of immigration in other parts of the country.,3
"I would like to see an immigration Bill that ensures that the benefits migration brings to some parts of Britain help to fund the extra housing, NHS staff and teachers necessary to reduce the pressures in communities like mine I support some measures in the Bill, but I can think of other measures that would address mainstream concerns about immigration while providing fair, reasonable and progressive ways of doing so.",3
Let us focus our efforts on the unscrupulous employers and organised gangs that bring people to this country illegally.,2
"Let us strengthen our border force so that Britain can have confidence that the rules are being enforced, and let us ensure that the costs and benefits of immigration are shared across the country.",3
I think that it is universally accepted that the British people want properly controlled immigration.,3
Their objection is to unfair and uncontrolled immigration.,2
"This Bill has been dressed up as a powerful response to that demand for effective immigration control, but it is in fact the opposite; it is a sign that the Home Office has given up on doing its job Instead of fixing that which is broken—the ports of entry that passengers go through without seeing an immigration officer; the practice, when police officers intercept people who have been smuggled in lorries, of sending them on their way and asking them kindly to present themselves at the Home Office in Croydon; and even appeals where, having refused an application, the Home Office fails to send a representative to defend the decision—the Home Office has instead allowed terrible delays in listing appeals, resulting in people who have no valid claim to remain here staying longer and putting down roots so that they become more difficult to remove The Home Office has rejected calls to extend the role and remit of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority so that practical action can be taken to prevent labour exploitation in sectors where we know it exists, such as the hotel trade and construction.",3
"Instead, it is delegating the problem to us—to ordinary people and not just employers, who rightly should check the immigration status of people who apply to work for them, in order to protect themselves and their customers.",3
"Those employers regularly complain to me that the information on the advice line is at best confusing, and at worst wrong We are told that there will be an advice line for some of the new groups who will have to check someone’s immigration status.",3
"Banks already have some experience, but landlords will now be expected to refer to an advice line in order to spy on the immigration status of their tenants.",3
"In effect, the Bill is setting us all up as snoopers on other people’s immigration status.",3
"Even privatised Capita, when given 120,000 records of overstayers, managed to persuade only 1,000 to leave I have been advising people about immigration status for over 35 years, but I still need to check with up-to-date experts about what some of my constituents’ entitlements are.",3
"The result is unsurprising, and it is confirmed by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants report on west midlands landlords: people will just stop taking the risk Britain, having been a tolerant and welcoming society in which iconic British successes have often been created by refugees and migrants—businesses such as Marks & Spencer and inventions such as the Mini, which was designed here by an Italian—will become a place where people with foreign names and accents face a kind of pass law system in which, in order to play a full part in society, they have to keep proving their status and the fact that they have rights.",3
"The point is that if someone has a full British passport, it is very easy to say that they are entitled.",4
"The Residential Landlords Association predicts, rightly in my view, that the consequence of this measure will be that people who do not have a British passport, even those who are British—we should remember that some 12 million people in Britain do not carry a passport—will find themselves discriminated against because the landlord thinks that the situation is difficult We need to make sure that the only landlords prosecuted are those to whom Ministers have referred, who are sometimes complicit in illegal migration and the exploitation of vulnerable migrant workers.",3
"The clause 8 offence of illegal working will apply to them, as my hon.",3
It gives immigration officers extreme powers without submitting them to abiding by protections like the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984—protections that police officers have to abide by.,3
"It forces people to appeal from overseas, and by doing so ignores the rights of children who will be separated from their parents.",3
"He did win it, and the immigration judge praised him for working so hard to support his family.",3
"The subject of immigration has created much thought and emotion in my constituency over a long period, whether it relates to EU or non-EU immigration, illegal immigration or refugees and asylum seekers.",3
The Bill focuses predominantly on illegal immigration and should not be confused with the action that is being taken to deal with the refugee situation across Europe There has been a significant increase in net migration to the UK.,3
It is true that immigration has made a positive contribution to our country.,2
"However, it is right that the Bill seeks to crack down on illegal immigration and to deter people who do not have a legal right to live in this country from staying in the UK or making their way here without going through the correct procedures to obtain entry My hon.",3
Friends the Members for Faversham and Mid Kent (Helen Whately) and for Gravesham (Mr Holloway) and I visited the illegal camp in Calais with the Bishop of Dover.,3
"Some articulated a belief that there were many more opportunities in the UK, and that it would be easy to obtain illegal work here.",3
"The Bill builds on attempts to tackle illegal working by migrants, as well as individuals who seek to exploit and profit from vulnerable migrant workers.",3
"It will provide a deterrent to those who wish to stay here when they have no legal right to remain, and it will also deter those who wish to make the journey to the UK with the intention of working here illegally In my constituency this summer unbelievable images of a transaction of people were witnessed and filmed by one of my constituents.",3
"It is right that individuals who have followed the correct procedures to apply for asylum in the UK are supported, but it is also right that asylum seekers who have been refused and have exhausted all rights of appeal should not then be supported by the British taxpayer Over recent months the county of Kent has seen a significant increase in the number of unaccompanied minors who have presented themselves.",3
"I know that local authorities will be nervous about the potential impact of these measures, and of increased pressures that they may place on the county’s resources and those of the south-east as a whole I wish to support the Bill because I believe that it goes some way towards tackling the attractiveness of the UK as a place to come to work and live in illegally.",3
It also spells out clearly that individuals who intend to exploit or profit from migrants will be dealt with by these provisions.,3
"Members, my mother is an immigrant, and one who, like many other immigrants in the UK, has given a lifetime’s service in the NHS It is as a lawyer I wish to speak in this debate, however, because I am concerned about the Bill’s attack on civil liberties, the removal of in-country appeals in human rights cases, the Bill’s lack of respect for the rule of law and due process and the shift from judicial to Executive control of the immigration bail system.",3
"Justice has grave concerns about the legal aspects of the Bill, as does the SNP I wish to focus on three specific areas: the extension of the enforcement powers of immigration officers; the new immigration bail system; and the extension of the “deport first, appeal later” rules to all human rights appeals.",3
"As has already been said, the powers of immigration officers are significantly extended by the Bill.",3
The power granted to immigration officers to enter and search premises without a search warrant solely because they have reasonable grounds to believe that a person in a premises is in possession of a driving licence and is not lawfully resident in the UK is a significant and arguably disproportionate extension of their current powers.,3
"Given concerns about the ability of the Home Office accurately to identify who is and is not lawfully resident in the UK, there are obvious risks for both British citizens and legal migrants, as well as illegal migrants, that their rights to respect for their private and family life and indeed their home under article 8 of European convention on human rights will be breached Another matter that concerns me is the broadly defined category of documents that immigration officers and other officers are empowered to search.",3
"While the power of immigration officers to search and seize these documents has the safeguard that they must not seize documents that they have reason to believe are legally privileged, there is no such safeguard in connection with searches by detainee custody officers, prison officers and prison custody officers when they are looking for relevant nationality documents subject to seizure.",3
"I believe that before these powers are conferred en masse, the Government need to examine how existing powers are being used and should make the case before Parliament for each additional power that is being sought On the bail system, individuals previously granted temporary admission, release or release under restrictions will all be subject to immigration bail.",3
"The Bill will bring many more people within the immigration bail regime, while simultaneously shifting control of bail and restrictions on liberty from the judiciary to the Executive.",3
"A large number of asylum seekers previously granted temporary admission will now be seen exclusively through a prism of detention and bail, casting aspersions of illegitimacy and even criminality.",3
I have constituents in Edinburgh South West who are asylum seekers.,3
"They are not criminals who should be subject to bail: they are refugees That brings me to the extension of the “deport first, appeal later” rule to all human rights appeals, not just those liable to deportation.",3
"It is important to be clear that this rule is being extended not just to illegal immigrants, but to all immigrants, including those who have been lawfully resident up until the Home Office rightly or wrongly refuses their applications.",3
Members to look at Justice’s detailed analysis of the practical and emotional difficulties that immigrants sent back to where they came from will face in progressing their appeal I am conscious of the lack of time I have left.,3
It places a duty on banks and building societies to carry out regular checks on the immigration status of individuals and to notify the Home Office when a person becomes disqualified from holding a current account.,3
"A failed immigration applicant should not have access to banking or other services, but I worry about the unintended consequences, not least for our own citizens from other cultures or for perfectly legitimate immigrants.",2
How many failed immigration applicants actually have a stash of cash that would need to be frozen?,3
These provisions could result in serious intrusion into the lives of all our citizens if they were applied in the wrong circumstances The Bill also contains the power to seize and detain vehicles driven by illegal immigrants.,3
"It provides for the prosecution and imprisonment and/or fining of those who drive if they are illegal immigrants, even if they are in possession of a valid driving licence from another state.",3
"Again, on the face of it, that might appear sensible, but I have to ask: do we really have a problem with lots of failed immigration applicants clogging up our streets and creating traffic jams with their cars, or is this just another point-scoring exercise How these provisions are to be regulated and enforced should be a matter for rigorous debate in this place.",3
How many UK citizens with foreign-sounding names will have their lives disrupted and become disfranchised as a result of these measures before we realise that this has been a mistake?,3
"Those Members have also missed some of the breakthroughs that she has made in identifying issues of abuse, particularly in relation to people trafficking, and of discrimination in relation to stop and search that other Home Secretaries have not addressed.",3
"We must put that on the record to balance the argument As many people have said, it is undoubtedly true that immigration is the No.",3
It is equally true to say that the vast majority of people who believe that to be the case are not anti-immigrant.,3
"However, they have specific things that they want to see in our immigration policies.",3
They want to know that the numbers of people coming to this country are reasonable and that our borders are secure.,3
"As we have heard from people who are themselves the daughters of migrants, they also want to know that the people who come here will do their best to integrate into the country that they now call home.",3
"If we cannot supply evidence to support the measures we are taking, I fear that some of the negative consequences—some of which have perhaps been presented today with a bit of hyperbole—might indeed come to pass I am worried that the Bill focuses too strongly on symptoms rather than on the underlying causes of the concerns about immigration in this country.",3
"Our previous Bills have contained a number of measures that have precisely targeted the causes, dealing with bogus colleges, spousal visas and even the English test.",3
"Above all, we want measures that deal with immigration but avoid things that are costly, ineffective or unjust.",3
"This Bill is an opportunity to correct that, address the position of victims of torture and rape, and introduce a limit on the period of detention for people who are subject to immigration regulations As has been said, this is not just about the extension of powers, but about how well we are using the powers we already have.",3
"Contradiction and conjecture are a recurring theme, and I very much hope the Home Secretary will explain why the proposals have been made when there is no evidence to suggest that existing measures in the Immigration Act 2014 are not working well enough or need to be extended Let us take as an example the extension of the “deport first, appeal later” provisions in the previous Immigration Act.",3
"Despite the stated aim of clamping down on illegal migration, the Bill goes considerably further and extends the principle of “deport first, appeal later” to all immigration cases.",3
"The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, for example, found that the pilot forced landlords to make poor decisions and that discrimination clearly occurred against both migrants and British citizens, including making landlords less likely to rent to anyone with a “questionable” immigration status—in other words, as other hon.",3
"Members have said, anyone with a name that sounds foreign What we do have evidence for is the economic benefit of immigration, including in the form of a warning from the chairman of the Institute of Directors, Simon Walker, who has said that the Bill will turn away “the world’s best and brightest” That is already happening in my constituency of Brighton, Pavilion, thanks to the ongoing changes to the student visa regime The latest changes include those to the international English language testing system for eligibility to study.",3
There is therefore considerable concern about the extent to which international students are being blamed for rising net migration—that is why I want to repeat my call for student numbers to be removed entirely from the net migration figures—and about the fact that many students on tier 4 visas will be criminalised under the proposals if they undertake paid work.,3
"Once again, the Government are pushing forward with their proposals without any impact assessment, nor do they seem to have any concern for the way in which their misleading and often divisive rhetoric affects individuals There is plenty in the Bill to object to, and there are also big gaps in what should be in an Immigration Bill, one of which is clearly the measures needed to tackle some of the problems in our current immigration system.",3
"The most notable problem is the Home Office’s long history of poor decision making on immigration cases, as demonstrated by the high rate of successful appeals.",3
"My surgeries are full of cases that illustrate the abundant delays in processing The Bill not only fails to take steps to improve the situation, but in effect removes the right of redress when the Home Office makes mistakes and individuals are wrongly identified as illegal migrants.",3
"That would be a violation of their human rights in and of itself, but it will be further exacerbated by the changes to the right of redress The Bill will also have an impact on asylum seekers.",3
"Removing financial support from those who have been refused asylum risks consigning vulnerable individuals to destitution, homelessness and exploitation.",2
"Many of those individuals may well have their asylum claim upheld on appeal, but I would argue that the measures in the Bill will push them underground, reducing the likelihood that an appeal will be brought.",3
"Even if there are strong grounds to refuse asylum, when did we become a country that is comfortable removing every kind of safety net for people who have come here and need it most?",3
It is clear that immigration has brought huge benefits to this country.,2
Friend the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller) about how compassion is the golden thread running through our approach to immigration.,3
"In fact, my parents’ experience has informed my strong belief that the immigrant story is a Conservative story—one of risk, starting from scratch, working hard and living frugally, all in the name of aspiration, endeavour and self-responsibility.",3
"That is why I am proud to be a member of the party proposing this Bill, which is aimed at tackling the root problems inherent in the broken immigration system that we inherited in 2010 Little is more contentious: last year, immigration overtook the economy as the most important concern of British voters.",3
"It deals with the loopholes exploited by illegal immigrants, meets the need for greater enforcement and investigation powers, and reduces appeal rights to streamline the system Before I came into Parliament, I worked as a Treasury counsel, defending the Home Office in immigration cases, and I saw how the system has been improved over the past five years.",3
"It made it easier to deport foreign criminals by enacting the principle of “deport first, appeal later” and ending the abuse of the right to family life Prior to the 2014 Act, I saw at first hand how that right was stretched so far as to make it laughable and pitiful.",3
I was involved in a case that involved the removal of a foreign criminal.,3
"One would have thought that it would be straightforward to justify the removal of a convicted class A drug smuggler, but because of the huge number of appeal rights, activist claimant lawyers and technical loopholes, as well as the backlog of cases in the courts system, it took nearly two years and thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money finally to persuade the Court of Appeal that the public interest in deportation outweighed the human right to a family life in Britain.",3
"I saw the practical effect of the huge backlog of 800,000 asylum cases on the Home Office.",3
"A reality of the previous regime was that the extensive number of appeal rights protracted the time that people spent in this country unlawfully More widely, we must talk about the impact of immigration.",3
The cultural impact of immigration cannot be ignored.,2
"The pace of immigration, the damaging predominance of multiculturalism, and the lack of integration in some parts of this country are having a damaging effect on social cohesion.",2
"A well-integrated immigrant must speak fluent English because that is crucial for developing relationships and gaining employment, and it connects us deeply with others.",3
"I therefore welcome the requirement for fluency in English in part 7 of the Bill We as a community of parliamentarians must be more courageous when speaking out about matters of integration and what is happening in this country, and when talking about the challenges we all face.",3
"The Bill deals with the problem of illegal immigration and tightens up the problem of exploitation, and that is the only way that we will command more confidence in the system and ensure its credibility.",3
"Speaking as the child of immigrants and the beneficiary of immigration, and as a professional, I commend this Bill to the House.",3
"More resources are required To protect themselves, many landlords will operate a blanket approach and will not take the risk of accepting any tenant who was born overseas or who has a foreign-sounding name.",3
The Bill will also make it easier for landlords to evict tenants who are found to be living here illegally.,3
"The Government are, shamefully, not willing to publish their review of the west midlands pilot before pushing ahead with the Bill, but reports from it suggest that the right to rent policy encourages discrimination towards migrant groups Part 4 of the Bill is particularly odious.",3
We should be reminded that the immigration appeal route exists for a reason: to correct a wrongful decision.,3
"The “deport first, appeal later” policy that was included in the previous Act led to 230 foreign nationals being deported in the first year of its being implemented.",3
"I ask the Immigration Minister to make clear, in his closing remarks, how many of the 230 completed the appeal process The Bill will create drastic consequences for all members of our migrant community and it sends the wrong message to the international community about what kind of country we are.",3
"The Bill will turn communities against one another, extending the powers of the state to unparalleled levels and creating a big brother society where ordinary members of the public will be expected to act as the UK Government’s very own immigration agents In short, the Bill is about pandering to the UK Independence party and the right-wing element of the Conservative party.",3
"Friend the Member for North East Fife (Stephen Gethins) and I were visiting the Nizip refugee camp on the banks of the Euphrates river in Turkey, only an hour from the Syrian border.",3
"When we arrived, we discussed the refugees’ situation with the head of the camp.",3
"He said that the people living in Nizip camp were not refugees but guests of Turkey: guests—what a contrast Instead of leading from the front, as Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government have, the Home Secretary engages in the distasteful process of “othering” on migration and immigration.",3
She stated that immigration was forcing thousands out of work.,3
"She made out that there was no net economic or fiscal effect of immigration when in fact all the available research, including that carried out by the OECD, shows that migrants to the UK contribute more in taxes than they spend in using public services I will be interested to hear why the Minister thinks that the report raised by the hon.",3
Does the Minister see any correlation between the demonisation of immigrants by this Government and the discrimination against our ethnic minorities in our wider community?,3
"This Bill is wrong My dad, whom we lost last year, was an immigrant from Pakistan.",3
"The first, with which I am sure all Members will agree, is that immigrants have made an enormous contribution to this country, which we should celebrate, not diminish.",3
"The second is that, in this country, we have a proud history of offering asylum to some of the poorest and most vulnerable people who have come here seeking refuge Of course there must be rules on immigration and asylum, and of course those rules need to be firmly and effectively applied.",4
"We also need to listen carefully to the concerns that have been expressed in the debate about immigration, and to take them seriously.",3
"As the Migration Advisory Committee noted in its 2014 report, “the combination of non-compliance and insufficient enforcement can lead to instances of severe exploitation, particularly of vulnerable groups such as migrants”.",3
Member for Pendle (Andrew Stephenson) Fairness and common sense dictate that we should not support the criminalisation of employees themselves for illegal working—a point made by my right hon.,3
"A number of Members have already said that those without immigration status can include the victims of trafficking and modern-day slavery, and to criminalise them would run counter to the good work that the Government have done to protect such individuals I listened carefully to what the Home Secretary said earlier in the debate.",3
There is no specific defence in the Bill in relation to illegal working.,3
"This is not an area where there is evidence of a need; offences already exist to deal with those who are illegally here, and in my time as Director of Public Prosecutions, this was not an issue where there was evidence of a need to provide for a further offence.",3
"Extending the restrictions to bank accounts makes sense and does not impose an undue burden on banks and building societies, but rolling out sanctions against landlords who rent to those who are disqualified because of their immigration status is both unfair and counterproductive.",3
What they saw as unfair was: “Making untrained civilians responsible for the work of immigration officers at a cost to themselves and under threat of legal action.” Those same landlord organisations also pointed a year ago to another danger: the potential for discrimination.,3
"That concern was simply put by them and simply understood by us: landlords, not properly understanding the task before them, concerned by the complications of immigration status and worried by the threat of legal sanction, will simply go to a default position where they will not rent to anybody who does not appear to them to be obviously British.",3
"Well, serious problems have arisen, and a number of Members have highlighted the evidence in the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants evaluation of the west midlands project.",3
"I accept that it is a small evaluation, but the figures have been quoted and they are alarming: 42% of landlords were less likely to consider someone without a British passport; 27% were reluctant to engage with those with foreign accents or names; 65% said that they had not read or did not understand the guidance; and 77% were against the roll-out.",3
I have a very blunt message for the Government: in the 21st century this House should not be in the business of passing legislation that has such potentially discriminatory outcomes I turn briefly to the issue of support in relation to those refused asylum.,3
"It will have the same result and the House should not support it; destitution should not be used as a means of enforcement In addition, the House should not support the proposals to interfere with the legal processes set up to deal with immigration and asylum.",3
"They are independent and impartial, yet this Bill proposes to give the Home Secretary the power to interfere with that In conclusion, whatever view one takes of immigration, this Bill is not grounded in evidence.",3
"Friend the Member for Fareham (Suella Fernandes) about the “deport first, appeal later” provisions and I would like to update the House.",3
"There is a need to tackle illegal immigration in those communities as much as anywhere else, and they have provided support.",2
We should uphold those principles and deal with illegal immigration I look forward to the continuing debates on the issues that have been highlighted.,3
The Bill will ensure the public’s expectation of a system that is fair to British citizens and legitimate immigrants while being tough on those who abuse the system and flout the law.,3
"This will include over 1,900 additional security and intelligence staff and more money to increase our network of counter-terrorism experts in the middle east, north Africa, south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa At the G20 summit in Turkey this weekend, we agreed additional steps to better protect ourselves from the threat of foreign fighters by sharing intelligence and stopping them travelling.",3
"We will improve integration, not least by inspecting and shutting down any educational institutions that are teaching intolerance, and we will actively encourage reforming and moderate Muslim voices to speak up and challenge the extremists, as so many do It cannot be said enough that the extremist ideology is not true Islam, but it does not work to deny any connection between the religion of Islam and the extremists, not least because the extremists themselves self-identify as Muslims.",3
"Britain, as has often been said, is already providing £1.1 billion in vital life-saving assistance—that makes us the second largest bilateral donor in the world—and last week we committed a further £275 million to be spent in Turkey, a country hosting over 2 million refugees.",3
"In February, the United Kingdom will seek to raise further significant new funding by co-hosting a donors conference in London together with Germany, Norway, Kuwait and the United Nations But none of this is a substitute for the most urgent need of all: to find a political solution that brings peace to Syria and enables millions of refugees to return home.",3
"ISIL is not just present in Iraq; it also operates across the border in Syria, although that border is meaningless to it—as far as ISIL is concerned, it is all one space.",3
"Corruption is the cancer at the heart of so many of the problems we face in the world today, from migrants fleeing corrupt African states to corrupt Governments undermining our efforts on global poverty by preventing people from getting the revenues and services that are rightfully theirs.",2
"My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, for initiating this timely debate, especially with international talks resuming in Vienna today and with Iran joining them tomorrow The Syria war has killed a quarter of a million people, contributed to the biggest refugee crisis since World War II and become a breeding ground for Islamic State and other extremist groups that threaten not only Syria but its neighbours and all the powers supporting one side or the other.",3
"Desperate conditions in the refugee camps are driving more and more to risk their own lives and that of their families to reach Europe But, as we have heard others ask, what of the strategy?",3
"A June summit resulted in a voluntary agreement to relocate 40,000 asylum seekers from front-line states.",3
The Vienna summit of regional leaders did little to prevent Hungary and Macedonia unilaterally stopping migrants from crossing their borders.,3
"In September, there were two more summits, at which a majority vote finally pushed through the use of mandatory quotas to relocate 160,000 asylum seekers from Greece and Italy to other member states over two years.",3
"There were also pledges of more aid for regional responses to the Syrian crisis, particularly in Turkey—the main launch point, as we have heard, for Syrian refugees trying to reach Europe.",3
"This month, October, EU leaders backed an action plan to offer Turkey various incentives in return for its co-operation in stemming the numbers of migrants and refugees boarding boats for Europe from its coast.",3
"What incentives and support will be given in return if one is achieved I, too, pay tribute to the support provided to the refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, but clearly we need to apply pressure on other European countries to increase spending so that the current cuts to the World Food Programme budget are halted.",3
"Perhaps the Minister can outline what the Government are doing to encourage other donor countries to give their fair share in addressing the refugee crisis Finally, as we have heard in the debate, the Prime Minister told the other place in September that the UK will now accept 20,000 Syrian refugees, but over the course of this Parliament.",3
"In light of the deteriorating weather conditions in Lebanon, how many refugees do the Government plan to take from the camps before Christmas?",3
"A vote will go to: British citizens living in the UK; Irish citizens resident in the UK; citizens of Gibraltar; Commonwealth citizens who meet the residency requirement for registration as an elector in the UK; British citizens who are overseas voters using their entitlement to register as overseas voters for up to 15 years after leaving the UK; service voters; and, now, Members of the House of Lords.",3
"In addition, Irish citizens resident in the UK can have a vote even though they are not in the Commonwealth I have come to the conclusion that all UK passport holders living outside the UK and at the very least those now living elsewhere in the EU should have the right to vote in the referendum, however long they have lived outside the UK.",4
"In a further piece of work, the Citizenship Observatory surveyed electoral rights in EU member states, and it seems that other EU member states do not grant foreign nationals a vote in national referendums either.",3
"If we left the EU, work permits could return, more people could have to apply for skilled migrant visas, reciprocal health schemes could be reduced, the operation of UK state pensions could be affected and the general ease of mobility for UK citizens across the EU would become much more complicated and uncertain.",3
The CBI has been consistently clear that for most British businesses the benefits of EU membership outweigh the disadvantages We must look very closely at the matter of immigration.,3
We should have control over our borders and pick and choose who is best for our economy and who deserves to be helped.,2
We have a responsibility to accept genuine refugees in need.,4
Last year I visited a refugee camp in Jordan and spoke to a number of people there.,3
I agree with the Prime Minister’s decision to take refugees from these camps but the numbers should be higher.,3
"With regard to migrants from other EU countries, we must appreciate that their entry does create problems.",2
The knowledge that our borders are open to free movement creates public apprehension and in some cases resentment.,2
The question of immigration from other EU countries needs to be revisited We must acknowledge that the Europeans are now our close allies.,3
There was no projection of ever-closer political union or integration.,3
"First, if I may, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale, for his work in foreign affairs over the years.",3
"In response to the appalling humanitarian crisis in Syria and the region, the United Kingdom has allocated £900 million and pushed for UN Security Council Resolutions 2165 and 2191 to enable the United Nations to deliver aid across borders However, we should not focus exclusively on dealing with crises—prevention is always more effective and much less costly than cure, in terms of both lives and resources.",3
"CSSF projects include work on reducing intergroup tensions, strengthening justice systems and the rule of law, security sector reform, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, for we understand that good governance, the rule of law, inclusive and equal societies, and effective judicial and security sectors contribute to an environment in which RtoP crimes are less likely to take place.",3
"Under the leadership of my noble friend Lady Anelay of St Johns, we are deploying teams of experts to help build state capacity in preventing and responding to sexual violence in conflict, from Mali and the DRC to Bosnia and the Syrian border areas.",3
"The Foreign Office is actively engaged online, using all tools available to pursue our foreign policy The noble Lord, Lord Desai, also mentioned United Nations peacekeeping availability.",3
The United Kingdom has deployed more than 20 asylum experts to other EU member states over the past three years under European Asylum Support Office plans.,3
A Home Office asylum expert is currently in Italy and others are due to start secondments to Greece and Bulgaria very shortly.,3
"We will employ a long-term, comprehensive approach using our diplomats, our overseas aid and our world-class Armed Forces to ensure that all people are afforded these basic, fundamental protections.",3
"We learn from the United Nations that there are 60 million refugees and displaced persons in the world and, since the beginning of 2014, getting on for 400,000 people have arrived in the EU.",3
"I would like a greater sense of how the Government think that the UK can contribute to EU solidarity on this matter, as well as enhancing the responsibility, which is the other side of the coin, of all member states to implement the asylum acquis.",3
"We know that there was not a good record in countries such as Italy and Greece even before this crisis; across the whole EU, apparently only two in five return decisions are implemented, which does not help the situation, although some ideas include much greater use of detention, which is worrying Sadly, the UK’s moral authority on matters of the asylum acquis is not increased by the fact that we have not opted into two of the five measures—the procedures directive and the reception conditions directive—in the common asylum system.",3
"Of course, we are not in the Schengen information system for immigration purposes, so the return decisions and entry bans are of no help to us.",4
I would like to hear what the Government think about the implications of the scheme for the future of the EU asylum system.,3
"I note that Austria has already stopped processing asylum requests, and Hungary has refused to take back Dublin transferees, so what is the future of the EU asylum system?",3
"One would have thought that it was tailor-made for this situation While we are on the asylum acquis, the Commission guidelines on fingerprinting have elicited considerable concern on human rights grounds, since they introduce notions of coercion and detention for failing to give fingerprints.",3
"Can the Government give us an idea of what really is the extent and scale of the problem of non-fingerprinting Even if the Government are hesitant on relocation, they need to do much more to help promote safe and legal routes into the EU, whether for refugees, displaced people or legal migrants.",3
"It should be much more positive and proactive on the resettlement side of the equation for permanent resettlement, humanitarian admission, enhanced family reunions, study visas and so on, by which I mean direct from the region, specifically for Syrian refugees, of whom 4 million are registered by UNHCR and hosted in neighbouring countries.",3
"Indeed, they are starting to close their borders, because the degree of pressure is leading to unregulated shanty camps, which are rife with disease and distress and act as a hotbed for radicalisation.",3
"Are the Government pressing those states to come up with the money There was an excellent article recently on resettling Syrian refugees by Dr Neil Quilliam, acting head of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House.",4
I have not got time to quote a lot of it but he feels that our failure to resettle or provide humanitarian admission to more than a few hundred Syrian refugees is harming the UK’s reputation in the Middle East and squandering an opportunity to influence a new generation of Syrians who will likely lead the reconstruction of their war-torn homeland.,3
"He draws an analogy with Iraqi Kurds and Kosovars and he proposes that the UK should admit 10,000 Syrian refugees as opposed to this couple of hundred.",3
"It does not have the same resonances as the relocation scheme On the return of irregular migrants, the Commission plans to revise the legislation on migrant smuggling by 2016.",3
"Ugandan Asians, for the most part, had British passports.",4
"We are talking about refugees, people who are fleeing evil regimes, situations of civil war and repression.",2
"I am grateful, as are others, to our noble friend Lady Prashar for the way in which she chairs our sub-committee and for the manner in which she introduced this debate We all understand the caution on the part of the Government when immigration was an issue that played large in the recent general election and when the policy of an open door excites sometimes very unfair, sometimes downright wrong responses from certain people.",3
We are not talking of ordinary immigrants here.,3
"The noble Lord has an Olympian view, honed by years of distinguished service to this country in the Foreign Office, while my more utilitarian views have been honed by years of experience in the rather more vulgar world of industry and commerce, so I am afraid that our views today do not coincide I was not a member of this sub-committee, but I have served on it before and was a member when, in the 2007-08 Session, it produced its report on FRONTEX, the EU’s external borders agency, under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Jopling.",3
"Then, as now, one could not fail to be appalled by the cynical behaviour of the people smugglers.",3
I remember a particularly heartrending evidence session given by a senior officer from the immigration service of Malta.,3
"He described overloaded, unseaworthy boats being towed by an inflatable until the GPS showed that the boat was in the territorial waters of Malta.",3
"A cheap satellite phone would then be handed to one person on the unseaworthy boat with instructions to call a number, and when it was answered to say, “We are in Maltese territorial waters.",3
"Secondly, while many noble Lords have referred to this country’s historical welcome to displaced persons and refugees, the situation now is that this country is experiencing, and will continue to experience for the next 20 years, a population explosion—unlike our continental European neighbours—with consequent strains on social cohesion.",3
"I am afraid that I do not accept the assertion of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that there is no pull factor from allowing immigrants, refugees and displaced persons to enter the EU.",3
"The challenge is that even at first quite small, limited numbers can begin the creation of what is known as an immigration superhighway.",3
The presence of these unfortunate people puts pressure on the Governments of the countries involved to police their borders effectively.,2
The Government have made a courageous and principled commitment to spending 0.7% of our GDP on overseas aid and have ring-fenced it.,3
"The economic power with our international partners—I entirely support the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, when she said that we ought to make sure that everybody does their bit—needs to be deployed to improve the living and economic conditions of these displaced people at source, as does our military power to offer protection to displaced people as well as to destroy the boats and generally inhibit the operations of people smugglers wherever they may operate I turn to the second reason why I believe that the Government need to keep control of our borders and should not take part in any relocation scheme.",3
"The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Peterborough, and others, talked about the contribution that refugees have made to our country in the past.",3
"I will direct my comments to the specific points made in the report and the conclusions set out in the last two paragraphs in respect of the Council decision that the committee retains under scrutiny The number of migrants and refugees attempting to reach Europe via the central Mediterranean Sea route has increased considerably, rising from 40,000 illegal border crossings in 2013 to more than 170,000 in 2014.",3
"On the eastern Mediterranean route through Turkey to the European Union via Greece, southern Bulgaria or Cyprus, there were just over 50,000 illegal border crossings last year.",3
"The EU border agency said in March this year that anywhere between 500,000 and 1 million people were waiting in Libya to cross the Mediterranean In response to this major unfolding and all too often tragic humanitarian disaster in the Mediterranean, the European Commission, as the report says, published a proposal just under two months ago for a mandatory emergency relocation scheme in respect of Syrian and Eritrean nationals who arrive in Italy and Greece seeking asylum.",3
"The EU Committee report notes: “While the Commission has presented the current proposal as a temporary measure, it intends that it should be a precursor to a permanent and mandatory scheme”, to be brought forward by the end of this year Under the proposal, responsibility for deciding the asylum claim would rest with the member state that accepts the relocated asylum seeker.",3
"Doing this would constitute a temporary and limited departure from the usual Dublin system for determining which state is responsible for processing an asylum claim, namely the member state through which the applicant entered the EU.",3
Our opt-in arrangements mean that we decide on a case-by-case basis whether to participate in new EU legislative measures on asylum and immigration.,3
"In this instance, the three-month deadline for indicating that we wish to participate in its negotiation and adoption, if that be the case, falls on 27 August this year In an article in a national newspaper on 13 May, the Home Secretary said that the United Kingdom would not participate in mandatory relocation or resettlement schemes, since in the Government’s view the schemes would create “pull factors” for further migration, strengthen the incentives for people smugglers’ activities and reduce the incentives on individual member states to ensure effective asylum systems of their own.",3
"In its report, the committee says that it is, “not in a position to express a view on the relative merits of a voluntary and a mandatory scheme, but we do not understand why the Commission, despite the clearly expressed view of the European Council, should have persisted in proposing a mandatory scheme, which it must have known was unlikely to be accepted by the Member States” The report also draws attention to the Government’s Explanatory Memorandum, in which they state their opposition to mandatory relocation and any form of relocation of asylum cases within the EU, and their conclusion that they are minded not to opt in to the proposal.",3
"These factors are that the proposal is amended to be a voluntary scheme, that there is consideration of how to implement an effective response to the situation in the Mediterranean, and that there is consideration of how the UK can contribute to a, “response to migratory pressures on some Member States without opting in” No doubt the Minister will be updating us on whether the Government anticipate, or are, reviewing their position As the noble Baroness, Lady Prashar, said, the committee’s report sets out the reasons why it is not convinced by some of the Government’s objections to the proposed decision, before stating: “The Government’s approach will do little to help the response to a humanitarian crisis within the EU’s borders”, and that: “The reputational risk of a continued failure to act, to individual Member States as well as to the EU as a whole, is great” The report concludes by saying that the committee believes that, “it is in the United Kingdom’s interest to take part in the negotiation”, of the proposed Council decision, “and that, should an amended or a new proposal be brought forward giving effect to the European Council’s Conclusions in April and June 2015, the Government should reconsider its position and opt in” There is an obvious difficulty in expressing a view about specific proposals that, as I understand it, have not yet been made and conceivably may never be made.",3
"We have already said that we should decouple asylum from migration targets, since the considerations in determining our decisions on these two issues are—or should be—very different.",3
We have already said that we would take more Syrian refugees.,3
"However, with respect to relocating those asylum seekers who have already entered the EU through Italy and Greece, the responsibility for processing their asylum claims should remain, as now, with the member states through which the applicants entered the EU and not with the member states, including the United Kingdom, that accept the relocated asylum seekers.",3
"Neither could we go along with a proposal that told us how many refugees we had to take, since that is a decision that should be made in this country, by this country The Prime Minister has announced a modest expansion of the UK’s resettlement programme, particularly for vulnerable Syrian refugees.",3
"The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, talked about the Vietnamese boat people, as he referred to them, and to the Kindertransport.",3
"I say this as someone who had the privilege of growing up there: they enriched our community and still do Since the crisis unfolded, the Government have been clear that relocating migrants within Europe is the wrong response.",3
It does nothing more than move the problem about Europe and does absolutely nothing to address the underlying cause of people getting on the boats.,3
It risks undermining control of our own borders and asylum system.,2
"The Government have no plans to opt into any relocation scheme, whether voluntary or mandatory We have been very clear that the time and attention that has been committed within the EU to negotiating the measure would have been far better spent on implementing long-term and sustainable solutions to the crisis, on tackling the abuse of the asylum system and on building capacity in those member states under pressure.",3
"The Government’s view is that real solidarity with other European countries is best expressed through practical co-operation to build capability in the asylum and migration systems of member states struggling to deal with the migratory flows The UK will continue to provide concrete support via the European Asylum Support Office to countries such as Greece—which the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, referred to—Italy and Bulgaria.",3
"Two UK asylum experts have just returned from EASO-led deployments to Italy, and one has just returned from Rome after a three-month deployment.",3
"The UK has made bilateral contributions to a number of countries, including Greece, for example by funding voluntary returns—where £2 million has been spent over the past two years from 2013 to 2015—and asylum programmes, where £600,000 has been spent over the past three years.",3
"I am glad that the EU is now moving beyond this debate and am hopeful that the focus of our efforts can now move firmly to action where it matters: on tackling the causes of illegal migration and the organised trafficking gangs behind it, and on increasing support and protection in the region for all those who need it We are establishing a dedicated law enforcement team to tackle the threat posed by illegal immigration from north Africa.",3
"As the Prime Minister has repeatedly said, we need to break the link between embarking in unseaworthy boats from north Africa and entering and remaining in the EU illegally.",3
This form of illegal migration funds organised crime and undermines fair immigration controls by allowing economic migrants unfair and uncontrolled access to our countries.,2
That is not to say that they are all economic migrants—there are incredibly large numbers of vulnerable people.,2
"They are a proportion of those coming through the central Mediterranean route, but in the eastern Mediterranean route people are primarily coming from the war-torn areas of Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria Wherever possible, we should return the boats immediately from whence they came.",3
"If we cannot do that, we must ensure that when they arrive on EU shores we stop, fingerprint and screen migrants to control their movement and distinguish between genuine refugees and economic migrants.",2
"In particular, we support the idea of establishing hot spots at pressure points along the external border to ensure proper licensing, processing and fingerprinting of arriving migrants.",3
That means investing real effort in infrastructure and expertise at the most exposed borders.,2
"However, it must also encompass broader initiatives to disrupt people smugglers and traffickers, and efforts to dissuade migrants from attempting the Mediterranean crossing and to address root causes through the development of humanitarian programmes.",3
"Since the crisis began, we have granted asylum to over 4,200 Syrian nationals, and only last month the Prime Minister announced that we would be expanding that programme On that point, it is worth reflecting on the letter sent by James Brokenshire, my colleague in the Home Office in charge of immigration, who I know gave evidence to the Committee and then followed up, I think also quite promptly, with written explanations of points raised there.",3
"He made the point that, when we talk about where this country stands internationally in terms of responding to this crisis, as my noble friend Lord Hodgson pointed out, despite immense fiscal pressures at the present time, we have ring-fenced and protected our overseas development aid programme at 0.7%—in fact, 0.71%—of GNI.",3
"Some of the front-line member states fingerprint very few migrants arriving on their shores, contrary to what the Dublin regulations say should happen.",3
She also asked what relation this legislation would have to the European Commission’s original proposed Council decision on the relocation of migrants.,3
"We will deposit the text agreed by the Council on Monday; the legislation is broadly in line with the Commission’s proposal of 27 May, with the exception that the numbers of migrants that each participating member state will take is set out in the separate resolution agreed by the member states in the Council on Monday, and is not determined through the mandatory allocation scheme originally proposed by the Commission Several noble Lords asked about the ongoing operations by the Royal Navy.",3
"Under Gateway, 6,300 cases have been resettled over the past 10 years, at 750 refugees per year.",3
The Gateway scheme sources the annual 750 quota for refugees from a small number of targeted locations; Mandate is designed to resettle individual refugees from anywhere in the world.,3
"We are not insensitive to that, but we are simply at a point of disagreement over the actual means of dealing with it, preferring to take the argument much further upstream to prevent the flows, systems, schemes and criminal gangs, which cause people to get on these boats to embark on this perilous journey.",3
"Today we have the opportunity of a debate on themes broader than our normal foreign affairs debates, which normally cover a specific region or particular theme.",3
"We would be independent and proud, but very much more limited Yet foreign affairs and defence appeared to figure very little in the general election campaign and our national priorities.",3
"Our press hardly covers those issues, only doing so briefly and spasmodically, and continues to cut the number of foreign correspondents.",3
The TV debates hardly touched at all on foreign affairs.,3
I recall one speech by Ed Miliband at Chatham House which included a controversial section linking the British-French bombing intervention in Libya with the boatloads of refugees crossing the Mediterranean.,3
"The EU debate proper hardly surfaced during the election campaign, save perhaps on immigration.",3
The chosen Conservative themes of credibility on the economy and a possible future Labour-SNP coalition dominated Times have changed; some of your Lordships may recall the general elections in the 1950s when foreign affairs were a major theme.,3
"Alternatively, failure to obtain a positive vote on the European Union will lead to the loss of Scotland, which wishes to remain part of the European Union, and to the United Kingdom being weakened in both our reach and our clout overseas.",3
"I hope that now we have another five years, we will have a foreign policy so that our influence on international affairs is more perceptive, subtle and creative than it has been in the last five years.",3
"It therefore rejects not just pluralism and the dialogue that democracy provides but even the nation state I want to focus particularly on the present surge in the volume of refugees, which is one consequence of the instability that has developed since the start of the Arab spring, which we and many other countries welcomed when in January 2011 Tunisia’s jasmine revolution overthrew a 23 year-old dictatorship and replaced it with something better.",3
"I suggest that HMG invite President Sisi, whose country is under attack from Islamist terrorism, to come to Britain to discuss how the West could, perhaps in collaboration with countries such as Egypt and Jordan, deal with the threat In recent months, the refugee crisis has been manifested in the Mediterranean by the vast numbers seeking to reach Europe by sea from Libya.",3
"Nearly 40,000 boat people have already landed in Italy this year.",3
"Rightly, the EU, including the UK, has responded to the tragic drowning of some thousands of these refugees.",3
There are already some 4 million refugees from Syria in other parts of the Middle East.,2
"There are millions more, including those from African countries—a mixture of asylum seekers, refugees, economic migrants and certainly some Islamist jihadists—ready to take ship from Libya to Europe The only way forward is to set up, with a United Nations Security Council resolution, a transit camp in Libya where all would-be migrants could be screened and assessed and to which those rescued at sea could be transferred.",3
"Britain would have to both play and pay its full part, which could come from our well-funded overseas budget.",3
"Suicide jihadists could fill a dinghy with explosive, which they could then detonate when alongside a rescue vessel—even HMS “Bulwark” could be at risk.",3
"I assure my friend the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner of Margravine, that indeed the foreign policy network will continue.",3
"She asked me specifically about cross-border aid into two areas, South Kordofan and Blue Nile.",3
But I am afraid that we judge that the risks of providing cross-border support to be high due to the limited number of implementing partners and our inability to assess or monitor the programmes.,3
"The UK supports strong integration of climate sustainability—the noble Lord, Lord Hunt asked about climate sustainability—across the post-2015 framework, including the target of holding the increase in global average temperatures below 2 degrees centigrade The United Kingdom will continue to push for a strong and explicit gender equality commitment and a strong and explicit commitment to the empowerment and realisation of the human rights of women and girls in the post-2015 framework.",3
"Broadly, the issues for consideration are sovereignty, competitiveness, fairness—particularly between eurozone and non-eurozone states—immigration and welfare.",3
"It was delayed for the usual procedural reasons during the period leading up to the general election, but it will now be published and taken forward over the next several months, and I would expect the main findings of the Muslim Brotherhood review to be published alongside the extremism strategy As well as playing a leading role in the global anti-ISIL coalition, we are working hard to degrade ISIL’s flow of finance and foreign fighters, and to counter the twisted narrative that ISIL promulgates around the world.",3
"We remain firm in standing against Russia’s illegal actions, and Her Majesty’s reading of the gracious Speech yesterday made that clear.",3
"The deaths of thousands of migrants have shocked and saddened us all, and the immediate priority is to save lives.",3
We need to destroy the trafficking and smuggling networks that are run for vast profits by those who have absolutely no care for human life.,2
"We need to step up our work with transit countries to strengthen their borders, and we are involved in ongoing discussions with the Libyan authorities on just that matter.",3
"Finally, we need an effective, humane programme to return migrants who have no legal basis to stay in the EU, otherwise it will be unfair to those who are yet to make the journey.",3
"We have a proud history of offering asylum to those who need it, but I agree with my noble friend Lord Marlesford that a mandatory system of resettlement is not the answer to the current crisis Several noble Lords raised the issue of Palestine and Gaza, and we will have Questions on that next week.",3
"However, we would like to see an agreement that ensures that Hamas and other militant groups permanently end their rocket and other attacks on Israel and that Israel ends its expansion of its illegal settlements—illegal in international law I was asked by the noble Lord, Lord Collins, and others, about Iran.",3
"They also remember, and this is particularly true of Ukraine, the mass famines and deportations that were driven both by the Nazis and by the Russian communists.",3
"The problem with nationalism is that if you use your Russian populations in the border areas, as has been done in Ukraine, you cannot necessarily control them.",2
"He would like to see greater disintegration, if you like, within the European Union and NATO That raises the question: how can we in the European Union make sure that we have a common policy towards Russia?",3
"When people say to me, “Oh, at the end of that road there is a common foreign policy and a common defence policy, and that will lead to a European nation state”, perhaps the first thing I would say is that history tends to indicate that a severe external threat often creates a united state in some form.",3
"We do not have to go down the road of a common European foreign and defence policy, but my goodness we really do have to have a clear strategy towards what Mr Putin is doing in Russia This is not just about the issues in Ukraine; there are issues along several of the boundary areas.",3
"I really do not believe that some of the other emerging great powers—India, China, South Africa, Brazil—think that it is a good idea to have a major power changing borders by force.",4
"It is not easy, but I will say this to the noble Baroness who is going to respond for the Government: please can we start doing all we can within the European Union to get a clear and coherent strategy on our foreign policy reaction to Russia and to the dangers in the border areas?",3
"Before I make a statement on counter-terrorism, Mr Speaker, let me update the House on what we are doing to help address the migration crisis in Europe and, in particular, to help the thousands of refugees who are fleeing Syria This issue is clearly the biggest challenge facing countries across Europe today.",3
Some are economic migrants in search of a better life in Europe; many are refugees fleeing conflict.,3
"The majority of them are Syrian refugees fleeing the terror of Assad and ISIL, which has seen more than 11 million people driven from their homes The whole country has been deeply moved by the heart-breaking images that we have seen over the past few days.",3
"It is absolutely right that Britain should fulfil its moral responsibility to help the refugees, just as we have done so proudly throughout our history.",4
"That means helping to stabilise the countries from which the refugees are coming, seeking a solution to the crisis in Syria, pushing for the formation of a new unity Government in Libya, busting the criminal gangs who are profiting from this human tragedy and playing our part in saving lives in the Mediterranean, where our Royal Navy has now rescued over 6,700 people Britain is doing, and will continue to do, all those things.",3
"The rest will go to neighbouring countries—Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon—where Syrian refugees now account for a quarter of the population.",3
"We will invest even more in tackling the causes of the crisis in the middle east and north Africa, and we will hold much larger sums in reserve to respond to acute humanitarian crises as they happen Turning to the question of refugees, Britain already works with the UN to deliver resettlement programmes and we will accept thousands more under the existing schemes.",3
"We have provided sanctuary to more than 5,000 Syrians in Britain and we have introduced a specific resettlement scheme, alongside those we already had, to help Syrian refugees who are particularly at risk However, given the scale of the crisis and the suffering of the Syrian people, it is right that we should do much more.",3
"We are proposing that Britain should resettle up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over the rest of this Parliament.",3
"Because we are not part of the EU’s borderless Schengen agreement or its relocation initiative, Britain is able to decide its own approach We will continue with our approach of taking refugees from the camps, and from elsewhere in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.",3
"This provides refugees with a more direct and safe route to the United Kingdom, rather than risking the hazardous journey to Europe, which has tragically cost so many lives.",3
We will continue to use the established United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees process for identifying and resettling refugees.,3
"When they arrive here we will grant them a five-year humanitarian protection visa, and we will significantly expand the criteria we use for our existing Syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme.",3
"In most cases, the interests of children are best met in the region where they can remain close to surviving family members, but in cases where the advice of the UNHCR is that their needs should be met by resettlement here in the UK, we will ensure that vulnerable children, including orphans, will be a priority In recent days, we have seen councils and our devolved Administrations coming forward to express their willingness to do more to take Syrian refugees.",3
Friends the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will now work intensively with local authorities and the devolved Administrations to put in place the necessary arrangements to house and support the refugees we resettle.,3
"The Home Secretary will update the House on these plans next week Finally on this part of the statement, in full accordance with internationally agreed rules we will ensure that the full cost of supporting thousands of Syrian refugees in the UK will be met through our aid spending for the first year, easing the burden on local communities.",3
This will be a truly national effort and I know the whole House will come together in supporting these refugees in their hour of need.,3
"Our approach includes acting overseas to tackle the threat at source, with British aircraft delivering nearly 300 air strikes over Iraq.",3
We believe in an open society and a well-integrated international society.,3
"The noble Duke, the Duke of Somerset, made a powerful point that how we treat our marginalised communities—the second-generation and third-generation children of immigrants uncertain of their acceptance within western society—matters in preventing the recruitment of new fighters to Daesh, al-Qaeda, Jabhat al-Nusra and the rest.",3
"The cuts in our local authority’s budget will weaken local efforts to integrate our substantial Muslim minority, to offer young Muslims training, jobs, self-respect and a sense of British citizenship within our national community Last week, we set out five conditions before we were willing to support the Government’s proposal to extend our military commitment over Syria.",3
"So long as the war in Syria continues, more refugees will struggle to reach safety in Europe.",2
Daesh recognises no border between these two countries: nor should we in attacking it.,2
"All of them are working to preserve the unity and integrity of the Syrian state and to uphold the values of citizenship, representation, pluralism, freedom, rule of law and respect for Syria’s commitments to human rights and international law.",3
It is a twin-track approach How is it envisaged that transition in Syria will work once Assad has gone?,3
We are now updating our planning to reflect the timeline envisaged in the Vienna process and we are asking others to do the same.,3
The United Kingdom has led UN efforts to make it illegal to sell oil and oil products to Daesh.,4
"It is worth my quoting what the Prime Minister said today in the other place: “Far from an attack on Islam, we are engaged in a defence of Islam, and far from a risk of radicalising British Muslims by acting, failing to act would actually be to betray British Muslims and the wider religion of Islam in its very hour of need” Let me make one point clear: strikes are only one element of a much broader strategy which looks to cut off Daesh’s sources of finance, stop its fighters crossing borders, cut off its weapons supply and counter its poisonous ideology.",3
Noble Lords on all sides have also reminded us of the importance of the need to provide humanitarian support for Syrian refugees.,3
"That is one of the consequences of our lack of control over our borders, in stark contrast with the control that the United States has over its borders The principal attribute of a sovereign country is its ability and rights to control which aliens, that is non-citizens, can visit or stay and which cannot.",2
That is the issue that the Prime Minister has correctly highlighted in his various speeches on immigration during the course of this Parliament.,3
"On 14 April 2011, he said that “for too long, immigration has been too high.",3
"Not just pressures on schools, housing and healthcare—though those have been serious…but social pressures too.” He went on to talk about those social pressures and issues relating to integration.",3
"The Prime Minister referred to 2.2 million extra people coming to this country between 1997 and 2009, and it is against that background that the Conservative party manifesto for the last general election said that “immigration today is too high and needs to be reduced.",3
"I welcome the Prime Minister’s recent reaffirmation in his speech on 29 November that he is determined to try to get net immigration down below 100,000 a year—in other words, to the tens of thousands It is worth considering a brief history of what has happened.",3
"Let us remember that at that stage net immigration into the United Kingdom, including immigration from the European Union, was running at about 37,000 a year.",3
"In the case of Chen, for example, the United Kingdom initially made provision to allow the primary carers of European economic area residents—self-sufficient children —to seek leave to enter or remain under paragraph 257C to 257E of the immigration rules.",3
"Whatever has been passed by the European Community has been extended in its impact, making it more difficult for us to be able to take control of our own borders Clause 1 reasserts the sovereignty of the United Kingdom in determining which non-UK citizens may enter our country and the circumstances in which non-UK citizens may be required to leave the United Kingdom Clause 2, which is entitled “Regulation of entry by non-UK citizens”, says: “Notwithstanding the provisions of the European Communities Acts, or of any other Act or Order, Regulation or Directive, the United Kingdom retains the exclusive right to regulate entry by non-UK citizens to the United Kingdom and to determine the circumstances in which non-UK citizens may be required to leave the United Kingdom.” I have referred already to clause 3.",3
"That is why clause 4 states: “From the date of the coming into force of this Act and notwithstanding the provisions of the European Communities Act 1972, any non-UK citizen resident in the United Kingdom without the authority to remain in the United Kingdom provided by a current visa, visa waiver, residence permit or other official document must apply for a registration certificate to confirm their right of residence in the United Kingdom.” The clause goes on to set out how that would work.",4
"Certificates would be issued and administered by the Secretary of State, and the content of the forms and the grounds on which applications could be granted or refused would be prescribed by the Secretary of State The model that I used for those provisions is what is currently contained in the UK visas and immigration legislation, under which one can apply for a registration certificate.",3
"The Government have said that they are concerned that a large number of people with criminal convictions from other European Union countries are coming into the United Kingdom, so I was encouraged when I saw that the application form for a registration certificate says under section 10: “Please provide details as requested below of any criminal convictions you may have both in the UK and overseas.” There is provision to set out all that detail.",4
"This is just another example of the farcical situation that we are in at present, where we do not have control over the people entering and leaving our country Under clause 4, the registration certificate system would require people to fill in the form accurately and give information about their previous criminal convictions, in exactly the same way as anybody who wishes to go to the United States of America has to obtain a visa.",3
"Under the current regime, there are no effective penalties against those who come into our country and we do not know how many such people there are In March 2014 I asked the Home Office for its “most recent estimate…of the number of illegal immigrants employed in the UK; and what change there has been in this number since May 2010.” The Minister for Security and Immigration, my hon.",3
Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (James Brokenshire) answered: “HM Government have not made any estimate of the number of illegal migrants currently employed in the UK.,3
"Given the clandestine nature of illegal migrants, any estimation is, by definition, extremely difficult and prone to considerable uncertainty.”—[Official Report, 3 April 2014; Vol.",3
"He then went on to explain all the wonderful things the Government are doing On 7 April I asked the Minister “how many illegal workers whose employment has been the subject of penalties pursuant to section 15 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (a) have been deported and (b) are still in the UK.” He replied: “We are better placed than ever to identify and charge those working illegally…It would not be possible to provide the information requested without linking immigration case outcomes to our data on civil penalties issued on employers.",3
"That was another completely useless response from a Government who are apparently trying to regain control over our borders, which has my full support, to ensure that the only people living here are those we really want to live here.",3
"As part of that process, of course, we need to know who those people are Where does one go for information about how many people are here illegally?",3
"One source of information is the Government’s December 2013 publication, “Sustaining services, ensuring fairness: Government response to the consultation on migrant access and financial contribution to NHS provision in England”.",3
"It estimates that, at any one time in England, there are about 2.5 million overseas visitors and migrants, of whom about 450,000 are from the European economic area, 1.4 million are from outside the EEA, 65,000 are ex-pats and 580,000 are irregulars, “including failed asylum seekers liable to removal, people who have overstayed their visas and illegal immigrants” The Government document estimates that there are 580,000 people here who should not be here, and it goes on to explain the significant burden they are placing on the national health service in various ways and how they are not contributing as they should be That is the scale of the problem.",3
"The Bill would, in a sense, flush them out, because if they did not have British citizenship, a residence permit or the right to stay here, they would be guilty of an offence.",3
I have raised before in this House the issue of what the Government are doing to enforce the provisions that make it illegal to be here without authority.,3
"Section 24(1) on “Illegal entry and similar offences” states: “A person who is not a British citizen shall be guilty of an offence punishable…with a fine of not more than level 5 on the standard scale or with imprisonment for not more than six months, or with both, in any of the following cases:—(a) if…he knowingly enters the United Kingdom in breach of a deportation order or without leave; (b) if, having only a limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, he knowingly either—(i) remains beyond the time limited by the leave; or (ii) fails to observe a condition of the leave; (c) if, having lawfully entered the United Kingdom without leave…remains without leave beyond the time allowed”, and so on In the context of the very large numbers of people thought to be in the country illegally, one might think that we would exercise effective sanctions against them.",4
"People in this country illegally and in breach of their obligations are not prosecuted or proceeded against, which is nothing short of scandalous.",2
"I have done a lot of work on migrants crossing the Mediterranean, landing in Italy and finding their way into other parts of Europe.",3
"In Italy, they are often not processed at all: their fingerprints are not taken, so nobody knows that they have ever been in Italy, which means that they can ultimately present themselves in another country in the European Union and seek asylum.",4
"Some asylum seekers or migrants try to fight the system and refuse to give their fingerprints—the Italian authorities say they do not take their fingerprints because they refuse to give them—so I suggested that if such people do not want to give their fingerprints, we should take a sample of their DNA, but I was told that that would be illegal under the Eurodac regulations.",3
"This is crazy: what harm can there be in people seeking asylum supplying their DNA, particularly if they do not want to give their fingerprints?",3
"Then, there was the great retreat from that position in his pre-Christmas immigration speech.",3
Gentleman and other speakers on the Government Benches over their disappointment with the Government’s record on immigration.,3
"The Government have abandoned the Prime Minister’s “no ifs, no buts” immigration target.",3
The chief inspector of borders finds that the Government make no attempt to check potential immigrants’ criminal records.,3
"In October last year, the Public Administration Committee found that 50,000 failed asylum seekers have been lost.",3
"What is needed is not exit from the European Union, but renegotiation, delays before new arrivals can claim benefits, more and properly trained border staff, proper entry and exit checks, and a requirement for applicants to provide criminal records What is remarkable about the debate over Europe in the Conservative party is that it thinks speculation about the UK leaving is Europe is costless.",3
The Bill raises important issues on the control of immigration to the UK.,3
"That is a key priority for the Government, and we have taken significant steps to strengthen the border and immigration system, including in respect of who is allowed to enter the UK and who is allowed to remain.",3
"There are also aspects of the Bill that would be unlawful The measures contained in the Bill do not reflect the extent to which the new powers and other reforms to control immigration, which the Government have put in place already, provide an effective basis for controlling our borders.",3
"For example, the Immigration Act 2014 put in place a series of fundamental reforms that will ensure our immigration system is fairer to British citizens and legitimate migrants, and tougher on those with no right to be here.",3
"The 2014 Act limits the factors which draw illegal migrants to the UK and introduces tough domestic reforms to ensure that our controls on access to benefits and services, including the NHS and social housing, are among the tightest in Europe A number of my right hon.",3
"We have new powers, too, to deport EU national criminals more quickly The Immigration Act 2014 will strongly reinforce our work to secure our borders, enforce our immigration laws and continue to attract the brightest and best to the UK.",3
"For example, we have revoked more than 4,500 driving licences held by illegal migrants, and since July 2014 we have deported more than 150 criminals, using new powers provided by the Act.",3
"New measures in it, including the immigration health surcharge and measures to tackle sham marriages and civil partnerships, will be introduced on a phased basis between now and April 2015.",3
"The Immigration Act also makes it easier to remove those with no right to be here and ensures that the courts must have regard to Parliament’s view of what the public interest requires in immigration cases, engaging the qualified right to respect private and family life under article 8 of the European convention on human rights.",3
"I was tempted to talk about our trade with China and other overseas destinations, as well as the potential in our tech and creative industries, particularly in the light of the very apposite remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Risby.",3
"No wonder that, according to a CBI survey last year, two-thirds of law firms think that leaving the EU will have serious negative consequences Part of maintaining the UK’s competitiveness is ensuring that it has a properly skilled workforce, with immigration policies that support business needs.",3
"Last week, we heard that demand for visas under the tier 2 cap outstripped supply for the very first time since 2011— and in huge number, too.",3
The Home Office has confirmed that the monthly allocation of tier 2 visas has been filled for June already.,3
"Last Thursday, the Prime Minister announced plans to make it harder to bring in skilled staff from outside the EU but non-European skilled migrants account for 0.066% of the British labour market.",3
It is very open in allowing virtually unrestricted access for foreign firms but this is not the case in the US.,3
"It is actually illegal for an English solicitor to fly to most US states to give advice on English law, so I hope that we will see US states remove the minimum practice requirements for eligibility.",3
This marked the beginning of a campaign of forced deportations directed against the Ottoman Armenian community.,3
"From 1915 to 1916 during the course of the deportations to the Syrian desert, it is estimated that well over 1 million Ottoman Armenians lost their lives as a result of massacres by soldiers or irregulars, forced marches, starvation and disease.",3
"A number of other minorities, such as the Assyrians, also suffered The British Government of that time robustly condemned the forced deportations, massacres and other crimes.",3
"The deportation and massacres of the Ottoman Armenians, and the role played by the UK and other allies in reporting the atrocities and helping the survivors, are an indivisible part of that story.",3
"The protocols envisaged opening the border and initiating diplomatic relations without any preconditions, and it is a matter of great regret that the ratification process for those protocols has not moved forward.",3
"I hope that both sides will continue to consider creative ways to re-set their relations and open up new channels for dialogue and co-operation This year, we will reflect with sadness on the nature and horrific scale of the deportations, massacres and other crimes in 1915-16 and on the importance of this centenary for Armenia and Armenians worldwide, but we will also renew our commitment this year to promote reconciliation between Armenia and Turkey.",3
"My Lords, it is a pleasure to speak on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government in this debate with a speakers’ list that would be the envy of any second Chamber throughout the world I pay tribute to the distinguished contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon, to foreign affairs over the years and to his formidable speech in which he described very aptly the multipolar interconnected world in which we now live.",3
"At home and overseas, more groups seek to do us harm than ever before and their ideology of violent extremism is spreading.",2
Our work overseas is critical to that response.,3
"As leading members of the global anti-ISIL coalition, our Armed Forces have made a significant contribution to dismantling ISIL militarily Our diplomatic network, working through international fora, is focused on stemming the flow of foreign fighters and resources to terrorist groups, strengthening borders and countering extremist narratives.",3
"Conflict and instability overseas affect the UK directly, providing fertile ground for terrorists and organised crime groups.",2
That work is made strategic and integrated through our Building Stability Overseas Strategy.,3
"Not only do we wish to protect the human rights of migrants and stop human trafficking and smuggling, but migration has links with many other priorities, including those we have debated today.",3
"For example, we are part of the core group of the Khartoum process, which is an EU-African Union initiative to tackle trafficking and smuggling in the Horn of Africa.",3
"We are working hard to help bring order and stability to Libya, not least to make it more difficult for the smugglers and traffickers to operate The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, mentioned the statement made earlier today by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence.",3
The FCO Prosperity Fund funds projects overseas with a wide range of agencies and NGOs to address climate change.,3
"We are working with the UN, the EU and the Commonwealth and are engaging them to take an integrated response to building stability and preventing conflict.",3
"We will do so though a long-term, comprehensive approach, using our world-class Armed Forces, diplomats and overseas aid to build stability, security and prosperity.",3
"I beg to move, That this House recognises the funding the Government has committed to the humanitarian initiatives to provide sanctuary in camps for refugees across the Middle East; calls for a greater international effort through the United Nations to secure the position of such displaced people; recognises that the Government has committed to accepting 20,000 vulnerable people from camps in Syria over the next five years but calls for a Government report to be laid before the House by 12 October 2015 detailing how that number can be increased, encompassing refugees already in Europe and including a plan for the remainder of this year to reflect the overwhelming urgency of this humanitarian crisis; further notes that refugees arriving in European Union territory also have a moral and legal right to be treated properly; and, given the pressure on Southern European countries, further calls for the UK to play its full and proper role, in conjunction with European partners, in providing sanctuary to our fellow human beings I am grateful to have the opportunity to move this cross-party motion in today’s Scottish National party Opposition day debate.",3
"Many of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been on the move are from other war-torn and oppressive countries Today, the European Commission has outlined its immediate plans to deal with the situation, and that does not come before time.",3
"For Europe, it is a matter for historical fairness Europe is a continent where people from nearly all countries at some point have been refugees at one time, fleeing war, dictatorship or oppression.",4
There is a fundamental right to asylum.,2
We know that efforts have been redoubled to dismantle human trafficking groups.,3
We learn that fewer boats are under the control of smugglers on the perilous route.,3
"We must recognise, however, that we—we the United Kingdom; we Europe—have clearly under-delivered in the common solidarity we have offered to refugees who have arrived on our territory.",3
"The Ebola crisis that threatened to engulf west Africa was just a five-hour plane ride away from the UK Nobody can fail to have been struck by the tragic images of desperate people putting their lives in the hands of criminal gangs and people smugglers, risking and sometimes losing their lives for the chance of a better future.",3
"More than 360,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Mediterranean this year.",3
"Britain has done and will continue to do a huge amount to help the Syrians who have been caught up in the crisis and, of course, our priority is to stop the senseless death of refugees and migrants making the perilous journey.",3
"Our assets, including Royal Navy ships, have played their part in the European response that has helped to rescue more than 6,700 people in the Mediterranean We are also working alongside other European partners to tackle the criminal gangs and trafficking networks that profit from this human misery, including by establishing an organised immigration crime taskforce that brings together officers from the National Crime Agency, immigration enforcement, Border Force and the Crown Prosecution Service into one team so that they can work collectively to address these challenging problems.",3
"Of course, we have provided sanctuary to more than 5,000 Syrian refugees since the conflict began and the Prime Minister has announced that we will provide resettlement for up to 20,000 additional Syrians in need of protection over the lifetime of this Parliament.",3
"Let me gently mention to him that I speak as the daughter of a South African migrant nurse who left apartheid South Africa in the early 1970s and arrived here with £5 in her pocket The International Development Secretary is right to say that this is not a distant crisis, but one for which we bear a moral responsibility, and, moreover, one that we feel is closely connected to us.",3
"I agree with the motion’s call for clarification on straightforward practical fronts, because the decisions that we make in this place to take more refugees, and the offers of help that are pouring in, will need to be co-ordinated and delivered by our local authorities.",3
"In 2013, two years into the Syrian crisis, I visited Lebanon and met refugees in makeshift camps in the Beka’a valley and in the Shatila camp in Beirut.",3
"Already 80,000 had died in the conflict, and already refugee numbers were reaching a fifth of the Jordanian population and a quarter of the Lebanese population.",3
"The Syrians whom I met in Lebanon were anything but economic refugees looking for new lives in Europe; they wanted to stay as close to home as possible, ready to go back and rebuild their country as soon as it was safe.",3
"Since then, however, the fighting has dragged on, and the situation has deteriorated markedly As the International Development Secretary says, our refugee response models do not match the scale and the time frame of this crisis.",3
"In countries such as Jordan, which is trying to maintain a delicate political balance, refugees are not permitted for fear of destabilisation.",3
"Unsurprisingly, the majority of refugees in Jordan have chosen not to live in the camps, and many are trying to eke out a living illegally in the cities.",3
"As we have heard, access to primary education—let alone secondary education—can also be hard to come by Given that context, it is not surprising that some refugees are losing hope, putting themselves at extreme risk at the hands of people-smugglers, and coming to the European Union in search of safety and some kind of future.",3
"We must ensure that refugees who are already in the EU find sanctuary, but I, too, accept the core principle set out by the Prime Minister in his statement on Monday.",3
"As we seek to do everything we can, we must not act as recruiters for criminal gangs and people-smugglers who are preying on the most vulnerable people.",2
"That is why I think the Prime Minister is right to say that we will take 20,000 refugees from UNHCR camps in the region There can be no doubt that those camps, where refugees face insecurity, lack of education and no job opportunities, are the point of greatest need.",3
"There can be no doubt they are entirely unsuitable for the most vulnerable refugees—victims of torture and chemical weapon attacks, and unaccompanied children.",3
"Let me end by saying that if we are to have any hope of genuinely tackling the problem at source, our efforts to combat ISIL and disrupt people-smugglers will have to be matched by the delivery of a new model of humanitarian response that is fit for a crisis on this scale and with this time frame.",3
"We need camps that are safe for women and girls, we need primary and secondary education to be available to refugees in the region so that girls like Menal do not despair, and we need innovative solutions that offer job opportunities to refugees I completely understand why countries such as Jordan are trying to preserve a delicate political balance, and do not want refugees to enter their labour market, but de-skilling an entire generation of Syrians—the very Syrians whom we want to return and rebuild their fragile post-conflict countries—is in no one’s interests.",3
"Member for Moray said, have told us that they are from immigrant families.",3
"I was working on aid projects in Africa almost 30 years ago, helping displaced people from neighbouring countries around there, and I was in Hong Kong when its Government, on behalf of the British Government, were trying to deal with the Vietnamese boat people.",4
It is incredibly easy for people to be critical of situations involving refugees if they are not dealing with it themselves and do not have the responsibility at the time.,2
"He seems to have entirely forgotten that his party, when in coalition government with my party, was responsible for bringing together this considerable increase in our commitment to international development, which has led to our being able to provide huge sums in funding and help hundreds of thousands of people, if not more than 1 million, in the refugee camps just outside Syria.",3
He made no reference to what is being achieved for the refugees from Syria.,3
"Instead of doing that, we should be focusing today on what we all share and what we can achieve together On that note, I wish to make a practical suggestion that I believe would make a real difference to this nation’s handling of the refugee crisis.",3
"The most practical thing we can do is encourage the leading charities and non-governmental organisations, perhaps in that meeting on Friday with the Government, to come together to create a new Syrian refugee fund, perhaps administered by Save the Children in particular, although others should be involved.",3
That would enable a significant fund to be available to help the refugees when they come to this country.,3
"We should pull together; make sure that we get on with implementing what has already been announced by the Prime Minister, and not try to split hairs about numbers of refugees; encourage the charities to create the fund in which the Government will match what individuals donate; locally capture significant offers of help through the asylum and refugee offices in our own counties; and make it happen.",3
"Of course, everyone in this House welcomes the Government’s plan to accept 20,000 Syrian refugees, and as we debate this issue we must remember with humility that while we debate, people continue to suffer and to die.",3
"It is important that the UK Government do more, and our constituents rightly demand that we do more The Government must set out a clear timetable for welcoming refugees as soon as possible.",3
"Although we wish to conduct this debate in a constructive manner, it is not helpful to link this debate—this humanitarian crisis—to talk of migration and immigration targets.",3
"The UK has done much in providing aid to Syrian refugees in the region, but it is rightly recognised that there is a moral responsibility also to resettle a fair share of refugees in the UK.",4
"Alan, the child whose tragic picture was seen across the world, was only one of more than 350,000 migrants who have attempted to cross the Mediterranean this year and, tragically, one of more than 2,600 who have lost their lives on that perilous journey.",3
"That must be a matter of extreme concern to all of us, not only as MPs but as human beings, and to our constituents Far from being economic migrants—the mantra still being trotted out in some quarters—62% of those who reached Europe by boat this year, according to figures compiled by the UN, were from Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan, countries ravaged by war and religious extremism.",3
"We have all read the emails and post from our constituents, and we know what public opinion is on this issue It must be remembered that, far from being the chosen or favoured destination for asylum seekers, Britain is by no means on the front line of the migrant crisis.",3
"Indeed, the migrants at Calais account for as little as 1% of those who have arrived in Europe so far this year.",3
"Estimates suggest that around 3,000 migrants have reached Calais, which is a fraction of the more than 200,000 who have landed in Italy and Greece As the world’s richest continent, we could do much more to address the unfolding tragedy.",3
"We must applaud the exceptional efforts of the German Federal Government, who are preparing to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this year, and recognise that a growing number of people in this country wish that the UK Government would adopt a more proactive role.",3
"As we have heard repeatedly in this debate, there is no doubt that the UK could comfortably provide sanctuary to many more asylum seekers, because UN figures show that the number of refugees in the UK has fallen from 193,600 to 117,161 over the past four years Despite the fact that UN figures show the number of refugees in the UK falling by more than a third over the past four years, only a handful have been granted asylum this year.",3
"Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) made the point very well that central Government funding is essential I take this opportunity to urge Members from across the House to sign my early-day motion—some have already done so—calling on the UK Government to show decisive leadership in ensuring a fair proportion of refugees are allowed to seek shelter across the UK.",3
"As many of us will have observed on the doorsteps while we were involved in the recent general election, the issue of immigration creates many reactions, not always positive.",3
Bradford has welcomed immigrants from all over the world since the time of the Huguenots.,3
The city experienced significant levels of immigration throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.,3
This debate is about contributions made by immigrants to both faith communities and public institutions.,3
The Jewish community in Bradford has been an excellent example of an immigrant community that did precisely that.,3
"He was knighted in 1882 and said: “Who would have thought it possible that now just fifty years after I stepped ashore on English soil at Hull, a foreigner and a Jew, I should be deemed worthy of the offer of a knighthood by the Queen’s government?” His firm, the Sir Jacob Behrens Group, still exists today.",3
"During the Second World War, many of the young soldiers from Bradford came from the Jewish community The subject of immigration, as I said, is often sensitive and people sometimes feel threatened by those with lifestyles and languages unknown to them.",3
I am pleased to say that many immigrants from different faith groups through Near Neighbours now join together.,3
Bradford continues to welcome immigrants from all over the world.,3
That is surely a demonstration from both immigrant communities that they make a valued contribution to both faith communities and public institutions.,3
I think it should be left at 14 days and not reduced to seven anyway Most members of the public think that they have a legal right to a passport.,3
I used to think that until I became the Minister responsible for immigration and citizenship in 2001 for a short spell of a year before the Prime Minister moved me on.,3
"It cannot be right for private companies to set the criteria of harm by major drug smugglers, gun runners, fraudsters and paedophiles which they think are not high enough to pass on.",3
"This Bill builds on a past of difficult legislations, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, mentioned Clause 1 proposes the seizure by police or other authorised persons of a passport where a person is suspected of intending to leave this country in connection with terrorism-related activity.",3
What is the distinction between the exercise of that power and this new power to take away a passport?,3
Is it possible to have a different evidential base for the suspicion necessary to trigger the existing power of arrest and the suspicion necessary for the new power to take away a passport?,3
"Obviously, there must be a stop list that causes someone at an airport or port to remove an individual’s passport.",3
"Without any reasons having to be given, the remedy of judicial review is further stultified Secondly, what happens to the individual whose passport has been removed?",3
"Why cannot the court consider the merits of a decision under Clause 1 Clause 2 gives power to the Secretary of State, on reasonable suspicion of involvement in terrorism-related activity outside the United Kingdom, to cancel the passport of a British citizen administratively and, again, without any judicial process.",3
"It is surely wrong for the Government to contend in their human rights memorandum that the Human Rights Act 1998, which is engaged, and the United Kingdom’s obligation under the European convention, do not apply to the removal of citizenship from a person simply because he is out of the jurisdiction.",3
"The questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, as to the effect of the temporary exclusion order on foreign jurisdictions must be answered.",3
Is not a programme of reintegration within the community to be preferred?,3
Will we house them separately in a completely alien society in Carlisle or Newcastle?,3
"Will we put them in a hostel for returnees so that they can be subjected to programmes of reintegration in, for example, Welsh-speaking Bala in Merionethshire?",3
"The principles in the Bill are admirable in performing those duties—with one caveat, which I will come to The power in Part 1 to seize passports is a lacuna that I was told of when I was visiting Heathrow Airport to see the Schedule 7 stop-and-search powers in operation.",3
Her Majesty’s Government were right to concede that we have to accept our citizens back if they are deported by other nations.,3
"Does that power not depend much on the co-operation of other nations if our citizens who refuse to comply with such broad conditions to return have to be detained, perhaps pending deportation to that country?",3
What if they escape detention or house arrest and therefore commit an atrocity on foreign soil?,3
Will we then have to compensate for the injuries and loss to that country and its citizens for failing our responsibility to allow our citizens to return I note the discussion of our passports.,3
"Of course, we do not have a legal right to a passport, and I do not think that this should be viewed primarily in terms of the citizen’s right to return to their own state.",4
"When you accept that nation’s citizens with their passports, that nation agrees to take them back at the end of their stay.",4
"I fear some kind of long-term tit-for-tat like the Cold War, and pockets of citizens in different countries who cannot go home to their respective nations If we act unilaterally to introduce conditional returns, could not some nations go one tiny step further and say, “We do not want our citizens back, even if you deport them to us”?",3
I hope to have my fears allayed but my final piece of preparation for today’s debate was to sit and read my passport this morning.,3
We need to be very careful and take a long-term view of the potential risks that we run by acting in this way in relation to the validity of our passport when we travel overseas.,4
"It is in fact secular, with its leaders being drawn, and many of its supporters attracted, from among the fanatical, alienated, criminal and psychopathic elements that lurk at the bottom of every society.",3
"Its stated aim is to establish a worldwide caliphate apparently recalling the days of the Ottoman Empire, which in 1923 Ataturk replaced with a secular republic in Turkey We are told that political Islam has succeeded in recruiting some 15,000 foreign fighters from 80 countries, the majority of them to ISIS in Syria and Iraq.",3
"First, in Part 1, with its powers to disrupt the travel of people suspected of involvement in terrorism, I suggest that one of the most urgent and easiest measures—not in the Bill—would be to require all British passport holders to notify Her Majesty’s Passport Office of any other passport they hold.",3
I have never sought any limit on other passports of British passport holders.,4
All I ask is that details of them are available in the records of the Passport Office and that they are revealed to immigration staff when scanning British passports.,4
"Now surely its time has come Other, very simple but necessary, changes to passport administration should include the automatic electronic cancelling of passports—I think that the idea of physically seizing passports is rather old hat—particularly, for example, those of all deceased persons.",3
"Quite often, these passports are flogged off on the black market.",3
The cancellation of passports of all persons while in custody or serving custodial sentences is also appropriate.,3
"We have heard of people suspected of terrorism, even on bail, getting out with their passports intact.",3
"The courts can already require the surrender of passports but I think that electronic cancellation would be simpler Secondly, there needs to be much more rigorous vetting and control of the integrity of Border Force staff and all those concerned with the processing and issuing of visas.",3
"Considering the improbability of detection, the scale of what in many cases was abuse of the administration of the immigration system for private profit suggests that this behaviour may be responsible for a significant failure to secure our borders The Answer to the Written Question gave an indication of the sort of profiling needed in the recruitment procedures.",3
"Given the ease with which people could get jobs in the border agency in order to make money from such practices, is not the possibility of terrorists infiltrating the Home Office to threaten our country a much more serious risk?",3
"I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that all government departments and agencies are now equally vigilant on the threat from political Islam Finally, I draw attention to the extremely unsatisfactory situation regarding the electronic monitoring of our national borders.",3
"That, by any standards, is big money What we should have is electronic scanning and recording of the passports of every person arriving at and leaving our borders, by land, sea or air.",3
This is largely because—as demonstrated by Raytheon—it is lacking in the computer skills and capabilities to defend our borders.,3
"I beg to move, That this House supports the recommendations of the report of the Joint Inquiry by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Refugees and the All Party Parliamentary Group on Migration, The Use of Immigration Detention in the United Kingdom; has considered the case for reform of immigration detention; and calls on the Government to respond positively to those recommendations I thank the Backbench Business Committee for responding so positively to the request from myself and the hon.",3
"In a week in which so much parliamentary time has rightly been devoted to our role in supporting refugees outside this country, today is a timely opportunity for us to consider how we treat those who are already on our shores The focus of the debate is the joint report of the all- party group on migration, which I chair, and the all-party group on refugees, which was chaired at the time we commissioned the report by the then hon.",3
"It took place following several high-profile incidents within immigration removal centres, including deaths and allegations of sexual assault, and amid plans to increase the size of the detention estate by expanding Campsfield House immigration removal centre in Oxfordshire The problems have been well documented, but Parliament has never taken a systematic and comprehensive look at how we use detention, so we thought there was a need for that wider piece of work.",3
We were talking via the phone link with a young man from a disputed territory on the Cameroon-Nigeria border.,3
He had managed to escape and eventually made his way to Heathrow using a false passport.,3
"We then asked him how long he had been detained, and his answer was three years—three years in what is supposed to be an immigration removal centre.",3
"By contrast, in 2013, Sweden, despite receiving three times the number of asylum applications we do, detained just 2,893, and Germany detained just over 4,300.",3
"It is easy to make the headlines, and it is easy to adopt a position, but we need to look carefully at this, and one of the report’s key recommendations is for the establishment of a working group with an independent chair The Home Office—indeed, the Minister—told the inquiry that a key purpose of detention was to maintain effective immigration control, but evidence for that is lacking, especially when we make comparisons with other countries, which is what we sought to do during our inquiry.",3
"We found that there were many differences between countries when it came to the way in which immigration was dealt with Australia is not particularly known for its liberal immigration policy, but after it introduced case management-based alternatives to detention, the programme had a 93% compliance rate, and 60% of those who were eligible for deportation returned voluntarily.",3
"At a cost of £164 million, immigration detention is not sustainable or affordable.",3
"According to independent research by Matrix Evidence, £76 million a year is wasted on the long-term detention of migrants who are subsequently released, and, between 2011 and 2013, £10 million was spent on compensation for unlawful detention.",3
"Yes, we may have a debate about controlling our borders, but we should do more.",2
"Whether people come here by fair means or foul, we should treat them with dignity to ensure that we genuinely reform the system of immigration detention Finally, let me return to Churchill.",3
"He famously said in relation to prisoners, but we can say it in relation to immigrants, “The mood and temper of the public in regard to the treatment of” —here I would say “immigrants”— “is one of the most unfailing tests of the civilisation of any country.” I believe we can meet that test.",3
Friend the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield) on securing the debate “We will enforce immigration rules humanely and effectively.,3
"We will end the indefinite detention of people in the asylum and immigration system, ending detention for pregnant women and those who have been the victims of sexual abuse or trafficking.",3
"And we will ensure Britain continues its proud history of providing refuge for those fleeing persecution by upholding our international obligations, including working with the UN to support vulnerable refugees from Syria”— and from all over the world.",3
I was proud to stand for re-election earlier this year on a Labour manifesto pledge to end indefinite detention for those in the asylum and immigration system.,3
"A joint report by the all-party parliamentary group on refugees and the all-party parliamentary group on migration, co-authored by my hon.",3
"Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Catherine West) has been trying since her election to visit the immigration removal centre, Yarl’s Wood.",3
"Liberty estimates that 45%—3,483 people—of those held on British immigration estates are asylum seekers, not economic migrants.",3
"In a week when moral indignation from the nation at large has caused action by the Government, I would like to think that this debate too can play its part in awareness raising and have a similar positive effect I do not have any of these so-called immigration removal centres in my constituency, but their names are known to me as almost a roll call of shame, and some touch on my constituents.",3
"People, including women and children, are locked up for months in draconian centres, not knowing when they will be let out Governments of parties on both sides of the House have sought to be tough, in the eyes of the electorate, on undocumented migrants.",3
"That is wrong and it blurs the issue of refugees and asylum seekers with the wider immigration debate, which tends to border on hysteria and forms a cycle that breeds a climate of hatred, fear, racism and demonisation of the so-called “illegals.” The UK has long had a reputation as a defender of human rights and civil liberties where freedom prevails, but the detention system is a stain on our character.",4
"Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson), the Mayor of London—I am not sure which is his part-time position—is not present, but in his 2008 incarnation he stood on a platform calling for an amnesty for all illegal immigrants.",3
"The community organising group Citizens UK, which has been mentioned by a few Members on both sides of the House, has a working group devoted to examining alternatives to detention as a means of processing migrant and asylum applications.",3
"Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield) for tabling the motion This should not be a debate about how we detain migrants and asylum seekers; in truth, it is a debate about how we treat our fellow human beings, many of whom are vulnerable and have suffered unmentionable experiences.",3
"When we consider the question of immigration, detention with no time limit cannot be the answer.",2
"We need an immigration system that is focused on fairness, not forced detention.",2
"A more compassionate, pragmatic and workable approach is needed I am dealing with several immigration cases for constituents at the moment, although none have involved any form of detention.",3
"With a cost of about £36,000 per detainee per year and more than 32,000 immigrants detained last year, we owe it to the taxpayer to change how we deal with immigration detention.",3
"I am not convinced that the current system does either of those things very well The Government need not only to acknowledge the gravity of the findings of the joint inquiry by the all-party parliamentary groups on refugees and on migration, but to engage with the many organisations throughout the UK that are calling for reform.",3
"We need to restore dignity to the lives of thousands of immigrants and asylum seekers, and we need to introduce some humanity to the cold mechanics of the Home Office.",3
"I am particularly grateful for the opportunity to raise the experiences of my constituents unfortunate enough to come into contact with the immigration detention system, and some of the flaws in our immigration policy that exacerbate the problem Our detention system is arbitrary and brutally effective at taking those, who may or may not have a case to remain, out of the communities in which they live.",3
"He is now afraid to sign in with his caseworker, as he is required to do weekly, for fear of being arbitrarily detained again That case alone would tell of a disproportionate detention system and a fundamentally unjust immigration policy, but it is just a small insight, as we have heard, into wider failings.",3
"Problems remain with communication, conditions, illegal detention, a lack of a time limit and cost.",2
The all-party groups’ recommendations are so desperately needed if our constituents are to retain their liberty and dignity throughout the immigration process.,3
"Community-based solutions, alongside time limits and proper judicial oversight, are all sensible solutions to help to ease those problems I turn briefly to the nearly 15,000 unaccompanied minors, such as my constituent, who are given temporary leave to remain when they arrive alone as children and find themselves in a prolonged legal battle as the clock strikes midnight on their 18th birthday, which usually ends in a detention centre and occasionally in deportation.",3
The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has found that 605 individuals over the past six years who arrived unaccompanied seeking asylum have been deported to Afghanistan on turning 18.,3
"The Home Office has given me the dubious assurance in the case of my constituent that his western upbringing will be of benefit to him in his new life in Afghanistan, but that is simply not the reality for many young people who return, fearing reprisals from the Taliban simply because they are known to have lived in the west The issue gained further prominence this week with the announcement in the other place that Syrian refugees aged 18 would be deported, which was retracted the following day by the Prime Minister.",3
I would be grateful if the Minister could provide details of exactly how these children will not be deported on turning 18.,3
"The process for dealing with unaccompanied minors when they turn 18 seems at best ad hoc and often leaves young men and women in limbo for years, in and out of the detention system I hope the Minister will agree that the harm facing these 15,000 unaccompanied minors is a considerable cause for concern and that perhaps time might be granted for further debate and to review this specific issue in our asylum system.",3
Members and our constituents and to signal a direction of travel away from detention as an arm of the immigration system.,3
I have worked with asylum seekers and refugees in Glasgow and the west of Scotland for many years.,4
Some have ended up in Dungavel immigration removal centre and some in Yarl’s Wood.,3
"Many have children who attend local schools, while the lengthy process of deciding asylum claims is played out, but they frequently have a perseverance and bravery that would put the rest of us to shame.",3
"One source of strength is the network of support offered by local communities and charities when asylum seekers arrive in their area, and I would like to pay tribute to the work of three organisations in my city: Unity, the Glasgow Campaign to Welcome Refugees and St Rollox church in my constituency These people also establish networks among fellow asylum seekers housed in the same buildings and with parents at their children’s school.",3
"Detention is costly and, I would argue strongly, an unnecessary step in the asylum process.",2
"If the Government are convinced that a case is without merit, and if all the available legal routes of appeal and tribunals have been explored, they have both the address of the asylum seeker and a venue where they regularly have to attend and report to the UK Border Agency.",3
"The average asylum seeker has only those in their local community, and they are mostly other asylum seekers who also have next to nothing.",3
The average asylum seeker has none of these things.,3
"Those who do take that route are in a minority Detention is a costly burden to the state and a damaging experience for the immigrant, especially if they are particularly vulnerable.",3
"I visited Dungavel, Scotland’s only immigration removal centre, while a Member of the Scottish Parliament.",3
"It is about warning new asylum seekers: “This is what could happen to you and your children, so stay away.” I hope they prove me wrong on that, I really do.",3
"I thank members of the all-party groups on refugees and on migration for their joint inquiry, and I want to acknowledge the work of Sarah Teather in bringing this about This report has rightly been welcomed as a powerful intervention in the debate on the reform of our detention system.",3
"Members have raised a range of issues—on time limits; the detention of the wrong people; the unnecessary deprivation of liberty; the experience of women, often victims of sexual abuse or human trafficking, in detention; the need for gender-specific processes; poor case management; access to justice and legal advice; access to health services; the desperate issue of self-harm and suicide; mental health issues caused by, as well as worsened by, detention; family separation and accompanied minors; the long-term impacts on the well-being of children; the training of staff; and the desperate need to look at alternatives to detention.",3
We in the Labour party have repeatedly called for a review and reform of immigration detention policy.,3
"In fact, Home Office statistics for the first quarter of this year alone show 3,483 people held in immigration removal centres.",3
"In May, the Home Secretary indicated that the length of detention is being considered by Home Office officials as part of a broader review of immigration detention.",3
"Those experiences would be harrowing for anyone, but we must recall that a high proportion of women asylum seekers have also reported previous experience of domestic or sexual abuse, and they will be particularly vulnerable.",3
Research has also shown that individuals who believe that they have been through a fair refugee status or visa determination process are more likely to accept and comply with a negative outcome.,3
"It is not just humane but vital that we see a culture change in our system and a change in the use of immigration detention so that it is a measure of last resort, not first resort.",2
"We would always prefer those with no right to be here to leave of their own volition, and a number of mechanisms in the Immigration Acts and the forthcoming immigration Bill are designed to promote that, but unfortunately it does not always happen.",3
"That may well require a period of detention, which we aim to keep as short as possible We need to be clear about the fact that detention is not only a necessary tool to support the removal from the United Kingdom of foreign criminals, which I am sure Members in all parts of the House would endorse, but equally important in managing non-compliance by people who are here without lawful basis of stay As a number of Members have mentioned, the report’s principal recommendation is that immigration detention should be subject to a statutory time limit of 28 days.",3
"I should explain that it is not possible to detain under immigration powers indefinitely, although some have sought to suggest otherwise.",3
"A reasonable time frame may be longer, for example, for a person with a history of non-compliance with immigration conditions than for a more compliant individual.",3
There are some very difficult cases involving foreign-national offenders who may be seeking to frustrate their removal.,3
"No doubt we will return to the issue of how that can be managed, in the context of, for instance, the use of electronic tagging, and I look forward to those future debates I am sure Members agree that it would be totally unacceptable to reward foreign criminals and illegitimate migrants who refuse to comply with immigration law by requiring their release, even when removal was imminent, simply because a blanket time limit had been reached.",3
"Concerns have been raised that we do not deport or remove people quickly enough, and that they may therefore spend longer in detention.",3
We are keen to ensure that deportation or removal takes place promptly.,3
"We streamlined immigration and appeal processes in the Immigration Act 2014 to support that, and we are considering what further steps can be taken People may be released from detention for a wide variety of reasons.",3
"I take this very seriously, because I want to ensure that the use of detention is appropriate and is applied in the right manner Part 2 of the report focuses on the physical conditions of detention, including the standard of accommodation provided in immigration removal centres and healthcare representation.",3
"Obviously, we have an overview from Her Majesty’s chief inspector of prisons, and I meet representatives of the independent monitoring boards that operate in immigration removal centres, whose reports I take extremely seriously Following the publication of the report, we asked Stephen Shaw, who was conducting an independent analysis of welfare in IRCs, to look specifically at part 2 as part of his review.",3
They were to return to Libya as a general purpose force to support the democratically elected Libyan Government; to disarm and integrate militias; and to improve the security and stability of the country.,3
"He mentioned vetting security and the process, too, and I will start with that Every potential recruit who successfully passed the Libyan vetting and selection process was subject to additional UK vetting in Libya to ensure that they met the minimum UK security, immigration, medical, physical, literacy and numeracy criteria.",4
Home Office visa processes included checks against UK criminal databases and a visa declaration by all trainees confirming they had no criminal convictions or charges in the UK or elsewhere.,3
All Libyan trainees not in UK custody or claiming asylum were returned to Libya by mid-November I shall turn now to the report.,3
"Communication procedures have now been reviewed and measures are in place to ensure better communication, should a similar event ever arise The report also raises the issue of disciplining foreign troops.",3
This would involve bringing foreign troops into the British military chain of command and require significant amendments to the Armed Forces Act 2006.,3
"Today, we have discussed how to keep Britain safe knowing that events in Syria and Iraq can inspire a terrorist to seek out training in Libya and turn a gun on British holidaymakers in Tunisia We hold this debate knowing that terror has no respect for borders, from the streets of Kuwait, to the suburbs of southern France, to the forests of sub-Saharan Africa.",3
"We know that we face threats that are varied and ever changing—from instability in eastern Europe and uncertain economic events unfolding in Athens, to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean, people fleeing conflicts in failed states and a region still recovering from the outbreak of Ebola.",3
"More broadly, we need to work with our partners to tackle the illegal trade in narcotics and the people trafficking that is spreading disorder and funding such atrocities across the globe.",2
"It is estimated that as many as 200 million people will have been displaced by climate change by 2050, which is five times the world’s entire refugee population in 2008.",2
"Some 70 years ago, a new majority Government took office and a new Foreign Secretary issued a warning that foreign affairs would present them with their most vexed and difficult problems.",3
I also welcome its co-operation in efforts to tackle the human trafficking and smuggling that puts people’s lives at risk.,3
Member for Glasgow North (Patrick Grady) asked about the Home Office’s approach to asylum policy.,3
"All asylum claims are carefully considered on their individual merits in accordance with our international obligations, particularly the 1951 United Nations convention on refugees.",4
The Home Office’s country guidance on handling Eritrean asylum claims was updated in September this year.,3
"The levy of a tax on nationals living in a foreign country is not in itself illegal—in fact, many countries do it—but the UN resolution made it clear that using coercive measures to try to collect such a tax would be illegal.",3
"Additionally, in order to help the French authorities secure their own border, Border Force and the police have been undertaking additional and targeted security checks against passengers and vehicles travelling to France via both maritime and rail ports and a number of airports across the country.",3
"We must therefore focus on tackling firearms entering and moving throughout the EU, and ensuring that we have the right capabilities at the UK border to detect firearms being smuggled in This Friday I will attend an extraordinary meeting of the European Justice and Home Affairs Council, where I will press the need for greater information-sharing, passenger name records, and action on firearms.",3
"Following any terrorist attack, we always consider the legal powers that we have to keep our country secure, but it is important that this landmark legislation undergoes proper parliamentary scrutiny The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 includes measures to deal specifically with the problem of foreign fighters, and to prevent radicalisation.",3
"It includes a power to seize, temporarily, the passports of people suspected of travelling to engage in terrorism overseas, extends our ability to refuse airlines authority to carry people who pose a risk to the UK, and introduces a statutory Prevent duty for a wide range of public bodies.",3
"11844/15 and Addendum, international protection for the benefit of Italy, Greece and Hungary; and agrees with the Government’s decision not to opt in to proposals establishing provisional measures for the relocation of individuals in need of international protection or to the proposal establishing a crisis relocation mechanism The motion covers a series of EU proposals on the relocation of migrants within the EU.",3
They formed a central part of the EU’s summer response to the ongoing migration crisis and have been the subject of long negotiations within the EU and of previous debates in the House The current migration crisis has been described as the worst refugee crisis since world war two.,3
"Relocation also reduces incentives for member states to tackle abuse, process applications and strengthen their borders.",3
It may also encourage more migrants to travel illegally to the EU.,2
"We must ensure that the permanent relocation proposal does not reduce the obligation on all member states to have fully functioning border and asylum systems The Government have consistently stated that the UK would not opt in to measures, whether temporary or permanent.",3
The duty to refugees is fundamental.,2
It seems to me that what the European Union has done has made the situation worse for the refugees themselves.,2
"Of over 900,000 who have come by boat to the shores of the European Union in 2015, 3,671 have either died or gone missing.",3
"The terrible events in the Mediterranean in 2014 led the Holy Father to say: “We cannot allow the Mediterranean to become a vast graveyard.” The reason this happened is the pious but failed hopes of the European Union’s refugee policy: the idea that as soon as people get into the boundaries of the European Union they will get citizenship, but if they cannot get here there is nothing that will be done for them.",3
"The EU’s policy is itself creating dangers for refugees The refugees who come are not the halt and the lame, but the fittest and the most able to take the risks involved in trying to cross the sea to come to the European Union.",2
"We have seen that 70% of the refugees who have come to the European Union are in fact men, primarily young men.",3
"In the year to March 2015, we took 183,000 economic migrants from the European Union; 183,000 people who were safe in their own country and not at risk of persecution.",3
"However, they are economic migrants, not refugees.",3
"We take 4,000 a year from the camps in Syria who may die if they do not escape, and we take 183,000 because we believe in the principle of European citizenship and that anyone who wants to come here from the EU should be free to waltz in, wherever they have waltzed from This is not only undesirable in domestic political terms: it is undesirable in moral terms.",3
"This seems to me a fundamental failing of the European Union, because—instead of giving aid to refugees—it encourages people to take unwarranted risks, and gives benefits to those who are already safe Why do I stick to this number of 183,000 and what is the context?",3
"They do not come because they are benefits cheats, yet we grub around on that, rather than thinking about the real problem—the scale of immigration from the EU.",2
"Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins) pointed out, free-for-all immigration does not work for our democracy.",3
"Apparently, our ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Germany has reported to Ministers that we do not need to worry about them coming here because the Germans are slow at processing citizenship applications.",3
"I always thought German bureaucracy was efficient, but clearly not; when it comes to processing citizenship applications, they might take 10 years.",3
"Ranked by asylum applications per head, Hungary has gone from ninth to second, behind Germany, while the UK has gone from seventh to 17th The Minister did not spend much time on the Government’s reasoning, but we know from comment elsewhere that they have spoken of the pull factor that would come from opting in.",3
"The migrants affected by the present proposal are those belonging to nationalities for which international protection is on average granted in at least 75% of cases—at present, those from Syria, Eritrea and Iraq.",3
"This is underlined, for instance, by the presence of millions of Syrian refugees in camps in Jordan and Lebanon.",3
"The Government’s argument that the relocation of 40,000 migrants who have reached Greece or Italy will somehow encourage more to leave their countries of origin is therefore unconvincing.” That is—to borrow the expression of the hon.",3
"The current rules mean that a Syrian father granted asylum in the United Kingdom would be allowed to bring his wife and younger children, yet if he had a 19-year-old daughter, for example, she would not ordinarily be able to come here.",3
Her parents would be forced to choose between leaving her behind and paying smugglers to bring her to the United Kingdom.,4
"Friends and me is to bring in 3,000 unaccompanied refugee minors who have reached Europe, and there has been an ongoing dialogue on that between my party and party leader, and the Prime Minister.",3
Twenty thousand refugees over five years is a drop in the ocean.,3
"We can and should do more to take those vulnerable Syrian refugees, who now face a bitterly cold winter in camps in Syria’s neighbouring countries and other parts of Europe.",3
"9345/15, EU Action Plan against migrant smuggling, unnumbered Document, a Council Decision on a European Union military operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR Med), unnumbered Document, a Council Decision to launch EUNAVFOR Med, and a Draft Action Plan on Stepping up EU-Turkey cooperation on support of refugees and migration management in view of the situation in Syria and Iraq; and supports the Government’s aim of working with the EU and Member States and other international partners to develop a coherent and sustainable approach to addressing current migratory pressures, focused on shorter and longer term actions to break the business model of people smugglers and traffickers, to break the link between rescue at sea and permanent settlement in the EU, and to address the root causes of migrants’ journeys Today’s debate offers an important opportunity to look at the range of measures proposed to address the migration situation.",3
We agree that there should be more effective joint action on returns and against people smugglers.,3
"We favour stronger co-operation with third countries, as well as more effective management of the external border.",3
"Indeed, we have continued to press our European partners on those points, both before and since the publication of the Commissioner’s communication We have also welcomed the proposals against migrant smuggling.",3
"The motion covers a number of important documents, including the “European Agenda on Migration” and, of course, the “EU Action Plan against migrant smuggling”.",3
"The “European Agenda on Migration”, for example, aims to set out an agenda for a fair, robust and realistic migration policy, and the action plan includes wider steps on issues such as people smuggling, recovering criminal assets, data gathering and the sharing of information, and the use of military assets We support those aims, and the motion’s call for “a coherent and sustainable approach to addressing…migratory pressures” We also praise and support the efforts of our Royal Navy and other armed forces, who have rescued more than 5,577 migrants from the Mediterranean so far.",3
"These documents attempt to identify an approach that will ensure that Europe remains a safe haven for those who are fleeing atrocities and persecution, while also securing its borders and creating the conditions for economic prosperity If there is to be a coherent and sustainable solution to the migrant crisis, we must crack down on those who seek to take advantage of people in their time of need.",3
Ruthless criminal networks organise the journeys of large numbers of migrants who are desperate to reach the European Union.,2
"They make substantial gains while putting migrants’ lives at risk, often squeezing hundreds on to unseaworthy boats, including small inflatable ones.",3
"Scores of migrants drown at sea, suffocate in containers, or perish in deserts.",3
"Smugglers treat migrants as goods, just like the drugs and firearms which they often traffic along the same routes.",3
"Civil war, persecution, poverty and climate change all feed into migration, which is why the United Kingdom must be involved in reinvigorated diplomatic efforts to bring peace and stability to countries such as Syria, from which most of the refugees originate.",4
It is important for there to be ongoing parliamentary scrutiny of UK involvement in anti-trafficking operations.,3
"The initial EU plan stated that phase 3 involved the disposing of vehicles and vessels used for trafficking, but the Government have said that 40 migrant boats have already been disposed of as part of phase 2.",3
"Can the Minister explain that, and can he tell us whether the phases have now changed As well as ensuring that the vessels used for trafficking are disrupted and disposed of, we must ensure that the people smugglers who take advantage of vulnerable people are brought to justice.",3
"I remind the Minister that, in his explanatory memorandum on the communications—this was some time ago, but I do not want to go through all that again—he said that the Commission had failed to “present the correct set of policies to address the problems that Europe is currently facing in the Mediterranean and from mother migratory pressures” I am sure that he will understand my asking this question, which is pretty obvious: what are the correct policies, if this is the wrong one The Commission considers that the asylum system in the European Union, and the operation of the Dublin rules, are regarded as being “fundamentally unfair”.",3
"Relocation applies to individuals who are already in the European Union, who have applied for asylum in a front-line member state, and who are presumed, on the basis of their nationality, to be very likely to qualify for international protection.",3
"Many no doubt justify receiving protection, but I then move on to the United Nations convention—the 1951 Geneva convention—and the breadth of the definition that is applied, and my concern is that what we really need is a re-evaluation of the definitions of what is a refugee, what is a migrant and what is an asylum seeker I have to say that at the meeting I referred to in the previous debate which took place in Rome only last Friday, at which all the Chairmen of the relevant Select Committees were present, there was in fact an endorsement of my proposal, which I have been putting to various international and EU meetings over the past four months, for a review of these definitions.",3
"People who are claiming asylum can fall back on these international conventions in a way that creates a blockage of the legal system and the jurisdiction and jurisprudence of the human rights legislation, whether in respect of the charter or the European convention on human rights.",3
"There is therefore an increasing statistical and legal problem which is that more and more people are claiming asylum and, effectively, being granted it.",2
"I am not saying there are not many cases where that is justified, but I am saying that I think the definitions are so wide that this is becoming a very difficult problem and is not in fact going to lead to any serious policy of returns or deportations.",3
The trouble is that with many traffickers and smugglers the problems exceed the capacity to deal with them.,2
"Turkey and the EU have signed a deal to give Turkey fast-track visa privileges in return for £3 billion-worth of aid and, I believe, the prospect of continuing financial support.",3
"The fact that so many people are making their way through the continent of Europe northwards towards Germany, causing an enormous amount of disruption, owes a great deal to the inefficiency with which I believe Turkey has been behaving recently In addition to that, without getting into the foreign policy and defence implications, Turkey has been at loggerheads with Russia, and that is a severe complication in relation to concerted action in Syria.",3
"I am therefore profoundly cynical about exactly how the Turkey deal will operate In terms of these fast-track visa privileges and its desire to come into the EU, we have to bear in mind that there are 78 million people in Turkey already, and I am told that that is increasing at something like the rate of about 1 million every 18 months.",3
"I am extremely grateful to the Minister for those remarks The UN convention on refugees was incorporated into EU law by virtue of the charter of fundamental rights, so when the European Court of Justice implements EU policies, it interprets key passages such as the right of migrants to claim asylum if they reach EU territory, under article 18 of the charter, and the non-refoulement prohibition on removal to an unsafe state, under article 33 of the UN convention.",4
"That is part of the problem, because as I have said, the charter incorporates the UN convention on refugees and all the definitions that go with it.",3
"That is the problem—it is a legal and political system, and it affects the issue of whether people are refugees or migrants I have no less sympathy for genuine refugees than anybody else.",2
"I have devoted a great deal of my time in the House to international development issues such as sanitation and water and people who are in refugee situations, but the current problem is not the same thing.",2
"That needs to be said in this debate, because the charter of fundamental rights means that the human rights dimension of the current problem, including the definition of refugees and asylum seekers, is locked into the acquis.",3
"In my opinion, that is one reason why so few of them are being dealt with appropriately As the Minister and I, and all of us, know only too well, the UK is not part of Schengen, but we are part of the Dublin regulation, which means that EU states and other UN convention signatories are obliged to allow for asylum claims as of right if a migrant reaches EU territory.",4
"Arguably, to claim asylum under the convention, a refugee needs to arrive directly from the state from which they are fleeing.",3
"We are now dealing with 900,000 people, and the scale of the situation is as much of a problem as anything else Under the convention and the charter of fundamental rights, frontier states are not—I repeat not—allowed to block the entry of those with a genuine right to claim asylum.",3
"The question of setting up a border fence—as I said earlier, there is more barbed wire in Europe than at any time since the cold war—is extremely uncertain in law.",3
"The non-refoulement prohibition in the UN convention on the removal of an asylum seeker to an unsafe state can also be interpreted in different ways, including so as not to exclude removal to a safe third state or safe recent transit state.",3
"This migrant issue, with all the tragedies it involves for those who are drowning in the Mediterranean and with the great deal of problems that come from fake passports, jihadists and so on, makes the situation even worse.",2
"I shall discuss those in a few moments’ time Yet again, I am disappointed, because we are talking about a refugee crisis, yet everything in the papers talks about migrants and migration.",3
This is not a crisis of migrants or migration; it is a crisis of refugees fleeing for their lives.,2
"We fully support the fact that we need to have co-ordinated and firm action against the criminals who are exploiting the vulnerable and desperate through people smuggling and people trafficking, but, as the Immigration Law Practitioners Association is keen to point out, people smuggling and people trafficking are not the same thing.",3
"This means that they need to be addressed in different ways We should also remember that the House of Lords EU Home Affairs Sub-Committee has recommended to the European Commission that when setting the legislation and directives that deal with people smuggling and people trafficking, we should make a distinction when it is clear that the smuggling has been carried out for humanitarian motives.",3
"Some may question whether that could ever be the case, but if it is clear that the act was done not for criminal purposes or for financial gain, but possibly through a misguided belief that it was a humanitarian act, would it be appropriate to classify such smugglers as international criminals?",3
"I would therefore be interested to know what the Government’s attitude to that is The motion also refers to action to tackle the “root causes” of migration, and I would be interested to hear what the Minister thinks are the root causes of 800,000 refugees arriving in Greece over the past year or so.",3
What are the root causes of 4 million people being in the refugee camps in and around the Mediterranean coast?,2
One thing that drives people into the unseaworthy boats of the criminals is that they have no other way of getting out.,2
"If the only way they can get out is by risking their lives with the smugglers, that is what they will do.",3
"If somebody is rescued from the sea, they are almost by definition a refugee.",3
They are claiming asylum.,3
We have to assess whether they are entitled to asylum.,3
"If they are here solely as an asylum seeker, they do not have an automatic right to live here forever.",3
"With the leave of the House, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will respond briefly to some of the points that have been raised during the debate Organised immigration crime is an important issue.",3
"It is worth underlining that in recent months we have developed a 90-member-strong organised immigration taskforce which has had a strong focus on the crime networks operating in some source countries and at transit points, including the Mediterranean, as well as the UK border and in France.",3
"I have written to the Committee on this previously, but to underline the position, we have highlighted four points: first, how EU money is spent on tackling problems at source in transit countries; secondly, an increased focus on fighting organised crime, with better joining up between member states; thirdly, dealing with economic migration regarding those who enter the EU without effective controls staying without consequence, where the issue of claims of refugee status not made out needs to be addressed more firmly; and fourthly, a stronger coherence between upstream development work and the return of economic migrants My hon.",3
We believe that an applicant’s asylum claim made in the EU should be dealt with by the member state most responsible for their presence in the EU.,4
"We continue to support that and to see it as a priority for moving forward The EU-Turkey action plan covers most of our priority areas, including controlling the flow of migrants to the EU from Turkey.",3
"It is about improving education, health and labour rights for Syrian refugees in Turkey to address the potential push factors for further migration.",3
It is important to stress that Turkey is accepting the return of some failed asylum seekers and tackling smuggling networks.,3
The agreed action plan incentivises Turkey to do more on border management.,3
"It does not guarantee visa liberalisation in relation to Turkey, and the UK does not have to offer a reciprocal visa concession.",3
"The UK stands ready to support, through the European Asylum Support Office and others, and to ensure that the appropriate support mechanisms are in place Our position on the migration crisis is practical, pragmatic and focused on the need for a concerted humanitarian response for those who need our protection; ensuring the sustainability of EU asylum systems; pursuing effective co-operation with EU partners; combating illegal migration and those who profit from it; and protecting our security.",3
"9345/15, EU Action Plan against migrant smuggling, unnumbered Document, a Council Decision on a European Union military operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR Med), unnumbered Document, a Council Decision to launch EUNAVFOR Med, and a Draft Action Plan on Stepping up EU-Turkey cooperation on support of refugees and migration management in view of the situation in Syria and Iraq; and supports the Government’s aim of working with the EU and Member States and other international partners to develop a coherent and sustainable approach to addressing current migratory pressures, focused on shorter and longer term actions to break the business model of people smugglers and traffickers, to break the link between rescue at sea and permanent settlement in the EU, and to address the root causes of migrants’ journeys.",3
"Some 570,000 migrants have crossed the Greek border this year, and because of the onset of winter and Russian bombardment we are seeing a spike in the number of arrivals.",3
The mayor says there is no room on Lesbos to bury any more refugees.,3
"We note that £20 million has been allocated, the Secretary of State has announced a further £5 million emergency fund and we will be deploying a new ship, but what action will the British Government, working with EU partners, take to tackle the increasing activity of people smugglers?",3
"The Government have promised to resettle 4,000 refugees this year and 20,000 over the next five years.",3
Some countries have attempted to maintain and police external borders; others have waved migrants through.,3
"The response of the Schengen zone is to establish hotspots in the countries where most migrants are arriving so that they can be properly processed, and then to have a mechanism for distributing them across the EU.",3
We have maintained our borders while others have taken theirs down.,3
We are not participating in the quota system for migrants who have arrived in Europe.,3
"Instead, we are taking 20,000 Syrian refugees straight from the camps.",3
"It is still the case that the United Kingdom has spent more on aid for Syrian refugees than any other EU country—indeed, more than any other country in the world save the United States of America Secondly, the EU agreed in outline a new joint action plan with Turkey.",3
That includes potential additional financial support to help with the huge volume of refugees—there are more than 2 million in Turkey—and assistance with strengthening its ability to prevent illegal migration to the EU.,3
"Although the terms of the EU’s assistance remain to be finalised, any visa liberalisation agreed under the action plan will not, of course, apply to the UK, and we will continue to make our own decisions on visas for Turkish nationals Thirdly, we agreed more action to stop criminal gangs putting people’s lives at risk in the Mediterranean.",3
"The EU’s naval operation is now moving to a new phase, in which we can board ships and arrest people smugglers.",3
"But more needs to be done in that area Thirdly, we need to ensure that the EU works for those outside the single currency and protects the integrity of the single market, and that we face neither discrimination nor additional costs from the integration of the eurozone.",3
"Fourthly, on social security, free movement and immigration, we need to tackle abuses of the right to free movement, and deliver changes that ensure that our welfare system is not an artificial draw for people to come to Britain As I have said before, those are the four key areas where Britain needs fundamental changes, and there is a clear process to secure them.",3
"Already, we have ensured that British people can travel freely around Europe, but have at the same time maintained our own border controls.",3
"More generally, the disruption caused backlogs of traffic in the Calais area that presented existing migrants around the town with opportunities to attempt to enter slow-moving lorries The French and UK Governments were well prepared for this event and tried and tested contingency plans were quickly put in place.",3
"Despite the extra pressure caused by the French strikers, Border Force maintained border security by following plans to put additional staff in place to search freight vehicles passing through the affected ports during the industrial action and thereafter.",3
"During the course of yesterday’s disruption and since, Border Force and the French authorities have successfully identified and intercepted a significant number of would-be migrants Last night, I spoke with the French Interior Minister, Bernard Cazeneuve.",3
Our two Governments have been working closely and constructively in recent months to bolster security at the juxtaposed border at Calais and other French ports.,3
"We will continue to work with Eurotunnel and the French authorities on installing additional security measures at the site to prevent migrants from making incursions into the port More broadly, the ongoing situation in Calais serves as an important reminder of why EU member states need to work together to tackle the causes of illegal immigration in source and transit countries.",3
We are already co-operating closely with the French to tackle the organised criminal gangs that facilitate the movement of migrants into and across Europe.,3
"UK and French law enforcement organisations have already had considerable success in dismantling criminal networks behind people trafficking and smuggling on both sides of the channel, resulting in the prosecution of 223 individuals, and Monsieur Cazeneuve and I have agreed to build on this important work.",3
"As the Prime Minister and I have repeatedly made clear, the most important step to resolving the situation in the Mediterranean is breaking the link between migrants making this dangerous journey and achieving settlement in Europe Traffic on both sides of the channel is moving again.",3
"There will, however, continue to be a significant border security operation as the backlogs of traffic are cleared at the affected ports.",3
"I am sure the House will want to join me in commending the excellent work done by Border Force, Kent police and others on both sides of the channel who have worked tirelessly to maintain border security and minimise disruption to the travelling public.",3
"and learned Friend raises important issues, but it is wrong to assume that all the people coming through those routes are refugees or have valid asylum claims.",3
Many people who come across from Libya into Italy are economic migrants who are trying to get into Europe illegally and to get settlement.,2
"It is also why dealing with human traffickers and people smugglers is important Within the European arena, we are talking about the possibility of establishing places—we are currently looking at west Africa—where it is possible to return people.",3
If more people who came to live in this country took British nationality it would possibility reduce some of our other integration problems.,4
"If the result is close at a few hundred thousand or a million, then people in this country will look for scapegoats and will blame the various foreigners or young people who have been allowed to vote.",3
"In the last year because of immigration, asylum and the huge movement of people around Europe we have seen more antagonism in this country towards foreigners than ever before—people perceived as coming here from Europe without any right to do so or the fear of a “swarm”.",2
"My Lords, the House owes a debt of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for his continual fight on behalf of refugees.",3
The present crisis of the Mediterranean boat people is largely reinforced by economic migrants.,2
"It is simply impossible to process people once they have arrived in Europe in a disorganised way, having either travelled illegally or been rescued because they were at peril on the sea.",2
"In the case of the UK, we have, of course, an opt-out from such a quota system The criticism that we in the UK have taken only a few hundred refugees from Syria misses the point.",3
We have provided £900 million to help more than 4 million Syrian refugees in third countries.,3
"If the whole of that sum were diverted to taking refugees into Britain, it would cover perhaps only 90,000 refugees—on the basis that the cost to the public purse for the care of each refugee in the first year is a minimum of £10,000 The only solution to the immediate crisis is urgently to set up holding areas outside Europe to which people can be returned for safety, sustenance, care and assessment.",3
"However, the last thing we want to do is create more overcrowded refugee camps.",3
"I envisage it becoming eventually a new world state, which I have suggested could be named Refugia.",3
"It was one of the most moving experiences of my life to see their bright eyes sparkling with hope An example on a smaller scale, which I have also visited, were the comprehensive facilities provided in Hong Kong for the Vietnamese boat people.",3
"More than 200,000 refugees from Vietnam came to Hong Kong in the 25 years from 1975.",3
"The EU, including the UK, should be expected to make a substantial financial contribution, not least because Refugia would be a location to which illegal immigrants arriving in Europe could be taken.",4
"There are a lot of these people, and I do not think it makes any difference whether we call them refugees, asylum seekers or migrants.",3
"Europe as a whole has gone anti-immigration—it is regrettable, but it has.",2
"When new Labour was in power, it had a most generous open-door policy of accepting migrants from the newer members of the European Union.",3
"In the last election, not a single party could be found which would actually say something positive about immigration.",3
"That means that the European Union, especially the members who are also permanent members of the Security Council—the UK and France—ought to move the United Nations and everybody else to seek a global solution to the refugee problem I will use a 19th century example.",3
"Some of them were facing persecution, especially those from the Polish borders and so on.",3
That is our attitude to migrants.,3
"They had absolutely nothing, and the despair that I faced in hearing them argue their need to take a boat that would cross the sea to Florida was something that I shall never forget.",3
"How many families have I seen emaciated by hunger when there was nothing they could turn to in order to alleviate that hunger I have come to understand economic migration in terms other than the denigratory way in which it is referred to as an alternative to the seeking of asylum and therefore a less important objective People who are hungry are hungry; people who are destitute are destitute; people who are forced to leave their families need all the attention they can get, and their cry should be heard.",3
"There, with fun, friendship, games and food they are given a chance to integrate in the new community to which they have come and to rediscover themselves on foreign soil.",3
"They have established humanitarian corridors in Morocco, on the other side of the Mediterranean, trying to identify people who may have a legitimate reason for going and help them to come safely to the place where they seek asylum.",3
"Christian Aid had helped the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front with material help—over the border from Sudan, as it happens, as well as from Kenya—during the time when the armed struggle against the Ethiopians was under way.",3
"In my view, the demarcation line between economic migrancy and being a refugee is really not that clear—I will try to remember to keep the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Griffiths, to refer to for the future.",3
Stories of reliance on smugglers—criminals—and the abuse and exploitation suffered at stage after stage of the journey are legion I read the title of this debate as extending to the plight—to use the term chosen by the noble Lord—of those who do reach the UK.,3
"In this country, they are faced perhaps with indefinite immigration detention, which in itself is harmful.",2
"However, an 18 year-old child might have to be left behind and become reliant on smugglers.",3
British citizens find it almost impossible to bring to the UK family members who are in danger We are familiar with the sometimes very long waits for decisions about asylum status.,4
We know how keen many asylum seekers are to work and the importance of work for both their own self-respect and their integration.,3
"It gave as one example: “Because of the experiences that led asylum-seekers to flee, they can be afraid of officials”— and then they come here and are faced with security staff of whom they are afraid.",3
Another example is that: “LGBT asylum-seekers may be asked to provide sexually explicit photographs or videos … to ‘prove’ their homosexuality” Noble Lords will be able to cite comparable examples of such policies A couple of weeks ago I met a doctor from Syria.,3
"There is great concern, which I share, about asylum support rates, both as they are now and as they may be if the regulations which had to be withdrawn at the end of the last Parliament are reintroduced I have been sent some articles written by journalism students who have interviewed refugees and I thought that I would share a few extracts with your Lordships.",3
"It’s also about the messages propagated by the media” One of the students wrote about the Leveson report on press standards, which covered the media’s influence over community relations: “the report found that, in the tabloids particularly, ‘there are enough examples of careless or reckless reporting to conclude that discriminatory, sensational or unbalanced reporting in relation to … immigrants and asylum seekers is a feature of journalistic practice … rather than an aberration’” Another interviewee said that government officials were looking for him in Syria.",3
"Like in a desert, but filled with people around me” The writer of the article said that she would not know how refugees express gratitude and asked the interviewee if he would answer the question: should we expect Syrian asylum seekers to be grateful?",3
"The war in Syria alone has produced 4 million refugees, making it one of the biggest refugee crises on record.",2
Millions more are displaced inside the country It is right that we have a debate on immigration and the state of affairs within our own borders.,2
"As the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, said, we must begin to establish the values that should guide our response to a refugee crisis fuelled by climate change, political unrest and conflict.",3
"As the noble Lord, Lord Luce, highlighted, 86% of refugees reside in developing countries.",3
They occur and people are compelled to cross the nearest border.,3
It goes without saying that it is vital to support refugees where they are.,2
"Governments, donors and NGOs must take a long-term view, as many refugees will be resident for years and even decades.",3
"That also means making sure that support is given to host communities, which are often just as poor and under immense strain, as well as to the refugees.",2
"By resettling more refugees, we not only offer a lifeline to some of the most vulnerable people but it will give us a greater moral authority when we call on countries such as Lebanon and Jordan to keep their borders open and uphold the rights of refugees The Government’s decision to halt the paring back of search and rescue operations by the use of HMS “Bulwark” was welcome, but does its replacement by HMS “Enterprise” signal a reduced commitment by the UK in the Mediterranean?",3
Can the Minister explain how the Government expect HMS “Enterprise” to undertake its dual operational functions of refugee rescue and the apprehension of smugglers?,3
"I fear that the response of Mr Brokenshire, the Minister, to your Lordships’ sub-committee, which was reported in the media yesterday, will only confirm to the rest of the world the UK’s continued reluctance to engage With regard to the Syrian conflict, the Prime Minister has announced a modest expansion of the UK’s resettlement programme, particularly for vulnerable Syrian refugees in the region.",3
"Of the numbers accepted from Syria, can the Minister also tell the House how many were already in the UK, including students My party’s view is that Britain should rejoin the United Nations official refugee programme for the most vulnerable refugees, understanding that many of these migrants will not even make it to a boat or get here on a plane; they will die in a camp without our help.",3
"There are close to 3 million refugees in sub-Saharan Africa as a result of violence and fighting in South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Nigeria and elsewhere.",2
"The conflict in Yemen has been so destructive that thousands of Somali refugees and other nationalities who had escaped there are now seeking safety in Somalia, even though that country continues to experience violence No country or region is immune, from Libya and the shores of the Mediterranean, through to the Gulf of Aden, and across the sea, where the Rohingya and Bengali families were stranded on boats for months with scarce food and water.",3
"The Prime Minister has emphasised that those people fleeing to Europe across the Mediterranean were being driven—pushed—to attempt these journeys, highlighting failed states and people smugglers as the drivers.",3
"However, what he failed to mention, which we have heard in this debate, is the persistent and widespread human rights abuses directed at their people by brutal regimes such as Eritrea, and the unsustainable demands being made on countries such as Jordan and Lebanon in trying to accommodate refugee populations UK Ministers, as highlighted by James Brokenshire’s remarks, suggest that resolving the Mediterranean crisis is dependent on breaking a mythical link between boarding a boat and settling in Europe.",3
Refugees and migrants have suffered appalling abuses.,2
"The contention that these immigrants are “economic migrants”, rather than desperate victims of human catastrophe, is inaccurate and alarming.",2
"António Guterres, the UN refugee chief, stressed that most of those attempting the journey are not economic migrants: a third came from Syria, while people fleeing violence in Afghanistan and Eritrea’s repressive regime each made up 12%.",3
"The British people, who are understandably concerned about levels of migration, are more anxious about human decency when confronted with the facts My right honourable friend Yvette Cooper said that we should decouple asylum from migration targets.",3
"Our aim should be an integrated development, defence, foreign and home policy that recognises that the global challenges we face are interconnected.",3
"It is therefore a matter of concern that the Department for International Development has been excluded from a number of cross-Whitehall committees, including the National Security Council and the immigration task force.",3
I commend him on his long-standing engagement on international development and foreign policy issues.,3
"As other noble Lords have said, we have all been shocked by the plight of migrants dying on an unprecedented scale on boats in the Mediterranean and in the Andaman Sea.",3
"She has rescued more than 4,700 people from sinking boats that have set off from Libya We have also provided two Border Force cutters to support the search and rescue operations, and to date they have rescued some further 450 people.",3
"We have always been clear that to tackle the migrant crisis we need a comprehensive plan in going after the criminal gangs, smugglers and the owners of the boats, potentially taking action there as well, and stabilising the countries from which these people are coming.",3
"Some people will be fleeing war and persecution, others are economic migrants seeking a better life.",3
"In the short term, we are providing humanitarian support to refugees and displaced people across the world.",3
"It is providing food, clean water, medical care and other essential aid that is helping hundreds of thousands of people in Syria and its neighbouring countries and is having a big impact on reducing people’s need to flee the region The Government have also just announced an additional £217 million to Africa to provide support to more than 2 million refugees who are displaced across the region.",3
"There is also a new £110 million programme for work in the Horn of Africa, with a focus on refugees in Ethiopia and Sudan.",3
"As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Kinnock, said, on the other side of the world, Rohingya refugees have fled their homes in north-west Burma.",3
"The United Kingdom is one of the largest donors in Burma, providing £18 million in humanitarian assistance since 2012 to Rakhine State, from where many of the Burmese Rohingya found on boats in the Andaman Sea originate We are also tackling the networks that lie behind people-smuggling.",4
This form of illegal migration funds organised crime and undermines fair immigration controls by allowing economic migrants uncontrolled access to our countries.,2
"The Government are establishing a dedicated law enforcement team to tackle the threat posed by illegal immigration from north Africa, in light of the surge in numbers crossing the Mediterranean.",3
We will work with our international partners to identify organised crime groups smuggling migrants to the Libyan coast; illuminate the routes and methods the smugglers use; and understand the money flows.,3
"The United Kingdom already participates in the United Nations programme to resettle refugees who have fled from their home countries, including those affected by conflict or civil war.",4
"Of this, £725 million will go bilaterally on development programmes to key source and transit countries for irregular migrants in the Horn of Africa and east Africa.",3
"We are issuing a joint demarche, with the US and the EU, to Ministers in Burma, and we are lobbying ASEAN member states Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia not to turn away boats in distress.",3
"We want to see improved humanitarian access, greater security and accountability, and a sustainable solution on citizenship.",3
We must contemplate difficult decisions to help break the link between getting on a boat in north Africa and being allowed to enter and remain in Europe.,3
Our colleagues in Spain have valuable experience in doing exactly this when migrants arrived in their thousands in the Canary Islands.,3
"We can learn important lessons from them, but we will be urging the EU to look to create safe zones in transit countries where illegal migrants could remain, or to which those who end up in Europe and who do not require asylum could be returned when it becomes difficult to send them home directly.",3
We have joined the informal working group to develop this and will be pressing for the level of ambition to reflect the need to fundamentally change the current patterns of illegal migration to the European Union My noble friend Lord Higgins mentioned the situation in Calais.,3
"The declaration included £12 million from the UK Government towards upgrading the security infrastructure at Calais and other juxtaposed ports The noble Baroness, Lady Kinnock, also mentioned asylum.",3
"The majority of illegal immigrants to Italy come from countries such as Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal where the drivers for emigration tend to be more economic rather than fear of persecution.",4
We have been clear that the United Kingdom will not sign up to a compulsory European Union quota system which risks undermining control of our own borders and the UK asylum system.,3
"However, I am proud of this country’s record for resettling refugees.",3
The noble Baroness also mentioned cross-border support in Sudan.,3
"While we are deeply concerned at renewed military activity in the two areas, we continue to judge the risks of providing cross-border support to be too high, due to the limited number of implementing partners and our inability to assess or monitor programmes.",3
"This response also supports Lebanon, Jordan, which was mentioned by other noble Lords, and Turkey to deal with the influx of refugees and the pressures this creates The noble Lord, Lord Luce, asked what we are doing in the regional development and protection programmes.",3
These are EU-led initiatives to increase efforts to deal with what is called the stickiness of refugees in transit countries.,3
"This has two goals: to strengthen EU member states’ co-ordination and coherence and to develop activities to strengthen migration management in the region, and benefit refugees and migrants The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, also mentioned the Syrian relocation scheme.",3
"Crime is down by more than a quarter since 2010; over 870 bogus colleges have been shut; the driving licences of over 9,500 illegal immigrants have been revoked; our benefits system have been tightened; over 1,700 people have been arrested as a result of sham marriage operations and more than 600 removed; and more than 24,000 foreign criminals have been removed since 2010 and our deportation laws have been streamlined In the past five years, we have implemented a programme of radical police reform, introduced a landmark Modern Slavery Act, worked to transform the criminal justice system by improving support for victims, rehabilitating offenders and making prisons more effective and legislated to strengthen our response to the grave threats we face from terrorism.",3
"We recognise that uncontrolled immigration has an impact on people’s lives, on public services and on jobs, and helps to hold down wages at the lower end of the income scale.",2
"So we recognise the impact of immigration, and that is why we continue to set ourselves that ambition and why we wish to build an immigration system that works in the national interest, is fair to British subjects and legitimate migrants, but is tough on those who flout the rules or abuse our hospitality Now that we are no longer encumbered by a coalition, we can take stronger action.",3
"We can create an immigration system that is tougher, firmer and fairer.",2
"We will introduce a new immigration Bill, which will ensure that we can remove those with no right to be in the UK more quickly, create a fairer labour market for working people and deny illegal immigrants access to public services.",3
"We will take the radical step of making illegal working a criminal offence, to make Britain a less attractive place for people to come and work in illegally.",3
That will provide a firmer legal foundation for seizing the earnings of illegal workers as the proceeds of crime.,3
We will also create a new enforcement agency to crack down on the exploitation that fuels illegal immigration We will further reform the immigration route for migrant workers and consult on the introduction of a levy on work visas under tier 2 of the points-based system to fund the development of skills.,3
"If we are to close the skills gap more quickly, we must reduce our reliance on foreign labour.",2
We will act to tighten up access to our public services and protect them against abuse by people who are here illegally.,3
"We will deny financial services to illegal immigrants, building on the existing power to prevent them from opening a bank account, and we will make it easier for landlords to evict illegal migrants from rented accommodation In addition, we will build on our reforms to speed up the removal process by extending the power introduced by the Immigration Act 2014 to require individuals to leave the UK before bringing an appeal against a decision in all human rights cases, except where there is a real risk of serious, irreversible harm as a result of the overseas appeal.",3
"This power is already making a difference, with over 800 foreign criminals deported since July 2014, and our new Bill will take those reforms even further.",3
"We will also create a power to require that foreign national offenders are tagged when released on bail by an immigration tribunal Finally, I want to turn to a subject that cuts across many of the home affairs and justice issues I have mentioned.",3
"Time and again, we have seen how the current framework of human rights law as applied by the European Court of Human Rights has led to rulings that have prevented us from removing dangerous foreign criminals from Britain.",3
"That has been the case in too many other instances, helping rapists, murderers and illegal immigrants rather than their victims or the law-abiding majority.",3
"It would also protect existing rights, which are an essential part of a modern, democratic society, and better protect against abuse of the system and misuse of human rights laws In the last Parliament we made significant strides forward in reforming the police and our immigration system and passed important legislation to counter terrorism.",3
"It will ensure that we can go further and faster with police reform and ban harmful new psychoactive substances; challenge extremism which threatens lives, families and communities; crack down on illegal working and continue to build an immigration system that is tougher and fairer; and reform and modernise our human rights law.",3
"This is the second day of the debate on the Queen’s Speech, when we are debating some of the gravest challenges that our country faces: public safety, national security, citizenship and the wellbeing of our communities; how we counter the extremism that poisons minds and terrorises communities; how we ensure high standards in policing and make sure that we still have police on our streets; how we control and manage migration, tackle exploitation and remain an outward-looking country; and how we protect our security, our liberty and our democracy.",3
"Yes, there are things in it that are from our manifesto, and yes, there is some common ground, yet overall it is a Queen’s Speech that claims to be about one nation but does more to divide us than ever—a Queen’s Speech that claims to help working people, yet takes away working people’s rights There were things we really wanted on home affairs and justice: a new offence to outlaw exploitation of immigration undercutting pay and jobs—it is modern slavery and it should be a crime—a new law to tackle violence against women, stronger laws against child abuse, stronger protection for victims, and plans to save money by abolishing police and crime commissioners.",3
"The right to be free from torture, the right to free speech, the right to a fair trial, the right to protest and freedom of association—these are inalienable rights.",3
"Lady to do much, much more on prevention of extremism in the first place, involving communities, local organisations and faith groups—something that, sadly, in the previous Parliament, the Government cut back repeatedly and that needs to be restored The Home Secretary made much of her new plans on immigration.",3
"Four years ago she put forward new immigration rules and said that as a result the Government anticipated that net migration would fall “from the hundreds of thousands…to the tens of thousands.”—[Official Report, 23 November 2010; Vol.",3
"The target is in tatters The Home Secretary also put forward rules that she said would allow the deportation of far more foreign criminals, yet she is deporting 500 fewer foreign criminals a year than she was five years ago.",3
"Two years ago she also brought in an Immigration Bill that she said would stop people working here illegally, yet the number of employers fined for employing illegal workers has gone down, not up.",3
"Friend is right—that is a problem The Home Secretary’s net migration target includes students, visa overstayers, workers and refugees, but it does not include illegal immigration.",3
That is why she failed so badly in the previous Parliament to deal properly with illegal immigration.,3
"It also does not include people who enter the country on short-term visas, even if they may then overstay and break the rules and abuse the system The problem for the Home Secretary is that by treating everything as part of her net migration target, she is failing.",3
"The area where her approach is failing most, and is most immoral, is the inclusion of refugees in the net migration target.",3
"Ministers shake their heads, but let us look at the evidence about what they have done as a result of their direct incentive to cut the number of refugees that Britain accepts Eighteen months ago, I called on the Home Secretary to make sure that Britain was doing its bit to give sanctuary to some of those in greatest need in the refugee camps outside Syria.",3
"Ministers are right to target people-smugglers’ assets and their empty boats before they can set sail, and right to try to build stability in the region, but that is not enough.",3
"Frontex has said that the main cause of the increase in boats is the situation in Syria, which has caused the worst refugee crisis since the second world war.",3
"Yet the Home Secretary is still resisting the UN’s appeal to give sanctuary to more Syrian refugees, and refusing to help the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to provide refuge to more of those fleeing Syria and so manage the boat crisis I do not expect the Home Secretary to sign up to an arbitrary quota system that is beyond our control, but I do expect her to offer to help.",3
"There are problems with seating, but we are very pleased to see her there This Queen’s Speech debate has been dominated by Europe and immigration.",3
"Member for Ashford (Damian Green) said about Europe, but not so much with what he said about immigration.",3
"As I said to the Home Secretary earlier, only 3% of the allegations that are made about illegal migration result in deportation.",3
"Friend the Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) in saying that Labour Members will support the Government’s efforts to deal with illegal migration and abuse by passing new legislation, but we must have an enforcement system that works, and it must go beyond some of the initiatives that we saw five years ago I am particularly concerned about what is happening in the Mediterranean.",3
"Sometimes we have to step back and remember the way in which our foreign policy decisions affect countries, bearing in mind that it results in attempts by refugees and asylum seekers to come to western Europe Along with others, including my hon.",3
"Thank you for calling me, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I welcome you to the Chair, as you oversee our proceedings We have just emerged from a long general election campaign, during which immigration featured as a hugely important and sometimes toxic issue.",3
"In Barking and Dagenham, immigration has been at the heart of politics for more than a decade.",3
"Focusing on the issue of immigration has therefore been central to my constituency work for many years, and I am thankful that the good people of Barking and Dagenham worked with me to expel and keep out the heinous politics of the BNP by denying it any democratic mandate.",3
"Most migrants come because they have secured a job, and we need their skills both to enable growth and to maintain our public services.",2
"Even if we could stop those jobseekers at our borders, net migration would still be running at more than 200,000 The truth is that people crossing national borders are a feature of the modern world.",2
"In the same way that capital crosses borders in a globalised economy, so people cross borders in a globalised world.",3
I remember when we thought that we could cut the net migration numbers by toughening up the regime on asylum seekers.,3
"We tried to close that route too, and then people tried to come in through the student visa route.",3
"What we really need from the Government is strong, open and candid leadership, which changes the conversation about immigration and talks about the reality of globalisation and the movement of people.",3
"It is the lack of control of our borders, more than the numbers coming in, that angers people and fosters suspicion and hostility When we examined those issues in the Public Accounts Committee, we were horrified by the sheer incompetence we found time and again.",3
"Some 29,000 applications for asylum, which dated back at least seven years, remain unresolved, with many people still waiting for the first decision on their case.",3
"More than 10,000 foreigners who had been in prison have not been deported despite a tenfold increase in the staff who were supposed to be tasked with delivering the deportation of foreign national prisoners.",3
Indeed we uncovered the fact that one in six foreign national offenders who had completed their sentences had absconded and disappeared into the community Let us get those things right and deliver the basics.,3
That is how the Government can establish confidence in the immigration system and in how we control our borders.,3
"I first challenged the old orthodoxy in 2008 and I know from my work in the constituency that if we introduce the principle that people should contribute to a society and earn their entitlement before accessing the public goods that have to be rationed, whether it is social housing or benefits, we would be seen as being fair to everybody, be they recent immigrants or families who have lived in the UK for generations.",3
"Such an approach helps to lance the boil that so easily turns fear of the impact of immigration into racism and hostility to people of different races, creeds and colour I support the Government’s intention to develop that principle.",3
We would all do well to understand that only 6% of EU migrants claim out-of-work benefits and many of them have earned that entitlement by working and living in Britain for many years.,3
"That does not absolve the Government of their responsibility to ensure that there are enough school places, GPs and hospitals and public transport facilities to meet the needs of everybody in our communities, including migrants and their families The Conservatives’ record over the past five years has been abysmal.",3
"While the Government wasted their very limited capital creating free schools in areas where there are a surplus of school places, they refused properly to fund new primary and secondary schools in areas such as mine, where there is huge pressure for more places The Government will not build a one nation Britain if they do not transform their approach to immigration.",3
"Investment in our public services, so that immigrants do not become the scapegoats, is what will help us build a united Britain where communities gain strength from their diversity.",3
"We had a long debate in January on the Serious Crime Act 2015, and I am greatly concerned about the issue of cybercrime and its economic consequences, including organised crime syndicates and the potential for foreign state activity.",3
"Modernising the law on data communications so that the police and the agencies have that information will be one of the most widely supported, if not highest profile, measures in the Gracious Speech The shadow Home Secretary rightly talked about the need to distinguish between asylum and immigration, but then she muddle-headedly expressed a number thoughts in which she completely brought them back together again.",3
"Those who fought the election campaign will have heard many things on the doorstep, but for a number of people immigration was one of the key factors in deciding how to vote.",3
"The new immigration Bill, particularly the provision on preventing illegal immigrants from accessing services that allow them to remain in the country and the “deport first, appeal later” principle in respect of people with no status to remain in the country, will be a powerful tool that could help to reset the whole immigration agenda.",3
"Many MPs might say, “You represent Wimbledon, a leafy suburb”, but immigration is among those issues I deal with.",3
"Only yesterday, I dealt with someone who had been in this country illegally for nine years and was still trying to stay here.",3
"The powers and provisions in the new immigration Bill will enable us to act with fairness and justice Although this is home affairs day, I would like to stray into an area that is not explicitly home affairs but which clearly affects many people in this country.",3
"This idea that we had no human rights and then, all of a sudden, in 1998 they all appeared out of nowhere is just complete nonsense, and the people who argue that case must know in their heart of hearts that it is nonsense The Human Rights Act has become a charter for illegal immigrants to avoid deportation, for criminals to avoid what was the will of this House when laws were set, and to allow prisoners to pursue vexatious complaints completely needlessly and at taxpayers’ expense.",3
"I look forward to taking on those arguments during the EU referendum debate and campaign I believe that those of us who want to leave the EU can win that campaign, not least because—I come to home affairs, which we are debating today—of the thorny issue of immigration.",3
"In the last Parliament, I was highly critical of the Government’s efforts—if one could call them that—to control immigration.",3
"The Prime Minister promised that we would reduce immigration to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands.",3
"People want the Government to control immigration, yes, but they also want the Government to be honest about immigration.",3
"If people want to stay in the EU and have unlimited immigration, that is fine.",3
"For some time, we have debated the treatment of overseas domestic workers.",3
"Before the Government changed the immigration rules, I wrote a report called, “Service not servitude”, and we have debated it since then.",3
"I am glad that we are debating it in the context of modern slavery because, horrifyingly, a shocking number of overseas domestic workers have to submit to slave-like conditions I am sad, however, because although Government amendment (a) in lieu looks as though it gives rights to such very vulnerable victims, it actually offers them less than other victims of modern slavery, which is very distressing.",3
There is the proposal to give someone a six-month visa.,3
A number of my Slough constituents who for one reason or another are subject to immigration control have only six months left on their visa.,3
"The Minister will know that Slough has a pretty buoyant employment market, but it can be impossible, even for constituents in a category which means they are almost certain to have their visa renewed, to find a new employer in that six-month period.",3
"We have heard much about it in relation to the Bill’s introduction, but what about overseas domestic workers?",3
"Because the exploitation of domestic workers does not always amount to enslavement: the courts have sometimes decided that people who are vilely exploited are not enslaved, and are not eligible for some of the existing protections under the regulations on trafficking.",3
"I am really glad about that, but I remember being told that there was tough guidance on people carrying their own passport through immigration control.",3
"Indeed, there is such guidance for immigration officers, but in speaking to victims who are overseas domestic workers, I have yet to find one who did so.",3
"I am afraid that the Minister’s tough guidance just does not work The guidance is not sufficient protection, and neither is the six-month visa, while the failure to sign up to the ILO convention is another example of inadequate protection.",3
The Minister has cited senior police officers who believe that her proposed changes will increase the number of overseas domestic workers willing to be police narks.,3
"Under the old system, it regularly helped women domestic workers to get their passports back, because—guess what?—their employers used to steal them and hold on to them Such support will not be provided by the Minister’s amendment (a).",3
I remember welcoming the Government’s move to opt into the EU directive on human trafficking in March 2011.,3
I congratulate him on that It seemed to me that the Government were putting themselves in a contradictory position by signing up to the EU directive on human trafficking.,3
"and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr Grieve), to City university about the role of UK law as a model for combating human trafficking and slavery, in which he summarised the progress that had been made.",3
"I was very concerned that it was entirely contradictory for the Government on the one hand to sign up to the directive and trumpet the work that had been done to combat human trafficking and slavery, yet on the other hand to change the immigration rules to make life much more difficult for domestic workers.",3
"I am glad that it has moved on from the position that it adopted on 16 June 2012, when it stated: “The position is that, if an ODW has been granted a visa to come to the UK to work for their overseas employer while that employer is visiting the UK, the ODW will have leave to remain in the UK in line with that granted to the employer—ie, up to 6 months’ leave (the maximum grant of leave for visitors).",3
"If an ODW leaves their employer during the time of the visit to the UK, the ODW will retain whatever time remains of the original leave granted and so will not be in the UK illegally during that time.” That did not seem terribly generous.",3
Let us suppose an overseas domestic worker came with a visa to stay in the UK for a certain amount of time.,4
"If they left their employer because of abuse, they could remain until their visa ran out but then they had to go.",3
"The letter continued: “The ODW will not be entitled to work for another employer, but they will not be in the UK illegally unless or until the leave expires.” As I said, we have moved on from that, but it seems that alarm bells have been ringing about abused and exploited overseas domestic workers for many years.",3
"The simplest way would have been for the Government not to have challenged Lords amendment 72, because it helps to ensure that our efforts to combat modern slavery are not undermined by an immigration system that ties workers into slavery We are now agreed across the House that the tied domestic worker visa effectively gives all power to employers and none to their vulnerable employees.",3
It forces domestic workers who are exploited by their employers to make the unenviable choice between breaching their visa conditions or staying with an abusive employer.,2
All reviews came to the same conclusion: the tied domestic worker visa strengthens the hand of the slave master against the victim of slavery.,3
"Friend the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) cited the kafala system that has led to countless cases of abuse in Lebanon, and NGOs used the pre-2012 UK overseas domestic worker visa as an example of best practice.",3
"We were commended for immigration rules that recognised “the particular vulnerability of migrant domestic workers to exploitation and incorporate fundamental protections as a result.” Later that year, we lost those protections, and the amendment seeks to restore them.",3
"If the Bill is to be taken seriously as a genuine effort to tackle modern-day slavery, Lords amendment 72 should stand unchanged Many of us are concerned that the Government are proposing not only to reject the amendment but to insert their own amendment that would provide domestic workers with the right to remain in the UK, but—this is an enormous but—only if they are determined to be a victim of trafficking by the authorities.",3
"I beg to move, That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for the re-establishment of the control and sovereignty of policy, administration and all other matters relating to the United Kingdom’s borders with the European Union and to the entry and exit to the United Kingdom of foreign nationals; and for connected purposes It is the paramount duty of Her Majesty’s Government to protect and defend the integrity of our national borders.",3
I do not believe there has ever been an electoral mandate for open borders.,3
"On the contrary, Governments of all parties have promised the British people that they would strictly control the entry of peoples into our country Indeed, the expectation of my constituents is that our Government will implement a policy to guard our borders from land, sea, air and the channel tunnel; to manage our immigration system to serve our national interest; and, most importantly of all, to keep our people safe from harm.",3
"I have to tell the House that the clamour of the British people for such an approach is greater now than at any time before, and no Government can ignore it From the outset I should make it clear that, while it is my intention in presenting the Bill to introduce a vital change, restoring full control and sovereignty over our UK borders to Her Majesty’s Government and our elected Parliament, thus making it possible to achieve more sustainable levels of migration, I am not against immigration.",3
"A nation that does not retain sovereignty over its national borders will ultimately be powerless to determine its own destiny Figures released by the Office for National Statistics show that net migration for the year ending March 2015 was roughly 330,000 people, of whom nearly half were EU citizens.",3
"Whatever one’s view, my Bill will give the British Government and British Parliament, elected by the British people, the absolute right to decide what our future British immigration policy should be Once sovereignty is restored, Her Majesty’s Government may wish to continue with the current policy of free movement of people from Europe, or even extend it to other countries, and that would be their right as the democratically elected Government of our country.",3
"They may choose whether to extend the ancestry rule, depending on their point of view, but whatever the Government of day decide, based on a democratic mandate handed to them by the British people, my Bill would restore the absolute power to do what Her Majesty’s Government believe to be right for Britain, and deny any supranational commission, Parliament or court the power to overrule us Control over our borders is one of the defining attributes of statehood: in short, a state cannot be truly self-governing unless it can ultimately exercise control over who can and cannot enter that country.",3
"It may be true that European immigrants have paid more in taxes than they have taken out in benefits, but the tangible provision of Government services simply cannot keep up.",2
"It takes time to build houses, establish GP surgeries, hospitals, and schools, and with the strain that we see on public services today, it is obvious that the increase in our population is having a significant social impact on our nation We must be realistic about the length of time that it takes for people to integrate into British society, and it is not unreasonable to say that such a rapid increase in population—including some people from very different cultures—has led to tension within our towns and communities.",3
"I welcome those people, so let me be clear that it is not immigration but uncontrolled immigration that I believe is unsustainable.",2
"If we are serious about achieving more sustainable levels, it is imperative that we first reassert sovereignty over our national borders Through our ever-closer integration with the European Union, I fear that we have lost sight of our place in the world as a global, trading nation, neglecting our close ties with the English-speaking world and Commonwealth, and instead aligning ourselves most closely with the one region of the world where economic growth is stagnating.",3
"My Bill would repeal all legislation that prevents the United Kingdom from asserting sovereignty over our national borders, freeing ourselves to look to the wider world and to enable the brightest and best talent to come to Britain, attracting highly skilled workers from Canada, India, Australia, the Caribbean, Africa, the Americas and the far east, as well as from Europe My Bill will give Britain a fresh start on immigration policy, restoring the right of control over our national borders to the British people and their elected Government.",3
"Our immigration policy and control of our nation’s borders rightly belong under the jurisdiction of our own sovereign UK Parliament, and it is to achieve that goal that I commend this Bill to the House.",3
"There are unauthorised excavations going on, and the plunder of and trafficking in stolen cultural artefacts which is an escalating problem.",2
The trading in looted Syrian cultural artefacts has apparently become the third largest trade in illegal goods worldwide.,3
"Shops selling Syrian antiquities dot the Turkish side of the border, just 40 miles north of Aleppo Another wonderful site is Palmyra.",3
"Friend the Member for Newark said, people who buy looted artefacts from Syria or Iraq are feeding insurgencies, fuelling the purchase of arms, and financing foreign extremists and mercenaries, as well as all sorts of other criminality It is estimated that looting is IS’s second largest revenue source after oil sales.",3
Another problem is that the law frequently differs between the source country from which the artefacts are looted and the country to which they are smuggled and then sold.,3
UNESCO has held workshops on how to combat the illicit trafficking of cultural heritage property from Syria and elsewhere.,3
"This will include over 1,900 additional security and intelligence staff and more money to increase our network of counterterrorism experts in the Middle East, north Africa, south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa At the G20 summit in Turkey this weekend, we agreed additional steps better to protect ourselves from the threat of foreign fighters by sharing intelligence and stopping them travelling.",3
"We will improve integration, not least by inspecting and shutting down any educational institutions that are teaching intolerance, and we will actively encourage reforming and moderate Muslim voices to speak up and challenge the extremists, as so many already do It cannot be said enough that the extremist ideology is not true Islam, but it does not work to deny any connection between the religion of Islam and the extremists, not least because these extremists are self-identifying as Muslims.",3
"Last week, we committed a further £275 million to be spent in Turkey, a country hosting more than 2 million refugees.",3
"In February the United Kingdom will seek to raise further significant new funding by co-hosting a donors conference in London together with Germany, Norway, Kuwait and the United Nations None of this is a substitute for the most urgent need of all: to find a political solution that brings peace to Syria and enables the millions of refugees to return home.",3
"It is operates across the border in Syria, a border that is meaningless to it because, as far as ISIL is concerned, it is all one space.",3
"Corruption is the cancer at the heart of so many of the problems the world faces today, from migrants fleeing corrupt African states to corrupt Governments undermining our efforts on global poverty by preventing people getting the revenues and the services that are rightfully theirs.",2
"Tackling illegal immigration builds social cohesion, takes pressure off public services and creates the space, politically, socially and economically to help those migrants in need, as we are now doing with refugees from Syria One of the principal aims of this Bill is to implement a manifesto pledge to crack down on those individuals who exploit workers in our country and to support working people.",3
"Some of the victims are migrants, but the criminals exploiting the vulnerable have no regard for their immigration status.",2
"Illegal workers, in most cases, have come to the UK for personal economic gain, circumventing our existing immigration laws.",2
"The current offences of entering the UK illegally and breaching immigration conditions date from 1971, but equivalent offences predate even that.",3
"The Crown Prosecution Service and the courts will provide the necessary oversight and support for the enforcement agencies, which will always seek a fair and proportionate outcome The Immigration Act 2014 broke new ground on regulating migrant access to services.",3
"We agreed to the creation of the immigration health charge, and to controls on access to bank accounts, driving licences and housing.",3
We want to stop illegal migrants driving on our roads and to deny them the use of bank accounts.,3
"Illegal immigration has a detrimental impact on multiple parts of society, from businesses who are undercut by unscrupulous employers paying low wages to illegal workers, to the threat that can be posed to social cohesion within local communities.",2
"Although immigration officers already have existing powers to deal with illegal immigration, we can and must go further.",2
That is why we are providing a basis for public authorities to share documents they hold that may assist the Government in controlling immigration.,3
"In doing so, we are simultaneously supporting a collaborative approach to tackling illegal immigration: a vital part of the Government’s objectives.",3
"Existing partnerships between immigration enforcement and the police have led to over 3,600 people being removed from the UK, so the benefit of collaborative working is clear.",3
"This must be strengthened, which is why we will also ensure that our immigration enforcement warrants are aligned with those of the police.",3
"Through this Bill, we will also fulfil the Government’s manifesto commitment to satellite-tag foreign national offenders when they are released on immigration bail, so that we know their whereabouts and can improve public protection.",3
Another method of combating illegal immigration is to accelerate the removal of those who no longer have the right to be in the UK.,3
"Under the 2014 Act, the introduction of the “deport now, appeal later” scheme has had a beneficial operational effect, allowing us to deport hundreds of foreign criminals before they appeal.",3
"This is why, in our manifesto, the Government committed to extending this to cover all human rights cases, except asylum claims.",3
"I reassure the House that this measure will only be used when requiring someone to appeal from overseas will not cause serious or irreversible harm, or otherwise breach their human rights.",3
"We are therefore confident that the extension of this scheme is a proportionate response to maintaining effective immigration control, a position supported by the Court of Appeal’s recent ruling that the Government are generally entitled to proceed on the basis that out-of-country appeals are a fair and effective remedy This House will agree that supporting asylum seekers, and ensuring we offer protection to the most vulnerable, is a cornerstone of our democratic and humanitarian society, particularly given recent events.",3
"However, it is not justifiable—or it is difficult to justify—that we spend millions of pounds supporting failed asylum seekers; individuals who have had their claims refused and exhausted their appeal rights, and who should leave the UK where there is no obstacle preventing them.",3
That is why this Government are taking firm action to restrict such support to failed asylum seekers who are destitute and face genuine obstacles to leaving this country I can assure your Lordships that there will continue to be safeguards to protect children.,3
"In addition to the continued Home Office support that I have just referred to, local authorities will remain able to support families without immigration status who would otherwise be destitute.",3
Local authorities do not have a general obligation to accommodate illegal migrants who intentionally make themselves destitute by refusing to leave the UK.,3
"Currently, the framework under which local authorities can support migrants without immigration status is complex and burdensome to administer.",3
"I appreciate that many in your Lordships’ House will again be concerned about the impact on children, but I assure the House that local authorities will continue to support children and their families to safeguard and promote the child’s welfare A further significant burden that local authorities face is the requirement to pay international tuition fees for adult migrant care leavers, which generally range from £12,000 to £15,000 per year but can be as much as £30,000 per year.",3
"This Government are not trying to deny these adult migrants access to a university education but the current position is unfair to other migrants and British citizens, who must qualify under regulations for student loans.",3
"Finally, we must make sure that we avoid a repeat of the situation that occurred this summer, where a small number of local authorities incurred substantial financial pressure to care for an unexpected number of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.",3
"We are therefore taking steps to encourage other local authorities to voluntarily accept responsibility for such children while simultaneously making sure that we have the required powers, through the Bill, to transfer responsibility for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children between local authorities While illegal immigration poses a significant problem for the UK, it is not the only area which requires greater control.",3
A lack of control over our borders poses a significant risk to our national security—a risk we cannot afford to take.,2
"So the Bill contains measures to ensure that airlines always present passengers to immigration control, and that the Government automatically apply UN and EU travel bans to stop dangerous individuals coming to our country Our manifesto committed to requiring all public sector workers in customer-facing roles to speak fluent English.",3
"Not only is the provision important for that purpose but it contributes helpfully to another manifesto commitment, to promote British values within society, and will simultaneously increase the efficiency and effectiveness of public services funded by the taxpayer Finally, many businesses in the UK are now choosing to hire overseas workers.",3
We must ensure we continue to welcome the brightest and the best migrants to the UK while also continuing to provide humanitarian relief to those who need it most.,3
"The last page of the Bill states that its purpose is: “To make provision about the law on immigration and asylum; to make provision about access to services, facilities, licences and work by reference to immigration status” On the face of it, that is pretty innocuous, since immigration has brought significant benefits to our nation.",3
"However, two sentences in the second paragraph of the Explanatory Notes tell us in blunt and stark terms the true objective and purpose of the Bill: “The purpose of the Bill is to tackle illegal immigration by making it harder to live and work illegally in the UK.",3
"The intention behind the Bill is that without access to work, illegal migrants will depart voluntarily, but where they do not, the Bill contains other measures to support enforced removals” This is one group of working people who will not be lauded by the Government but will instead now be criminalised and removed from the country for the offence of working hard.",3
"We shall need to keep in mind the two sentences I have quoted from the Explanatory Notes as the Bill goes through its different stages in this House, since they explain the driving force behind the Government’s clumsy legislative proposals Strong arguments will no doubt be made that in reality some of the clumsy measures in the Bill will make the illegal immigration situation worse rather than having the effect the Government envisage.",3
The differences of view that are likely to arise will be over the manner in which the declared objective of reducing illegal immigration is intended to be achieved and the likely effectiveness of the measures actually proposed.,3
"Unlike the Government, we will not be judging the desirability of or the need for the measures in the Bill against the criterion of whether they make life harder for some extremely vulnerable people No one is likely to be opposed to reducing illegal immigration—the key word being “illegal”.",3
"There appears to be a need in the Government’s eyes to give the impression to their supporters that they are acting tough on immigration, when in fact the Bill simply highlights the reality that the Government, on this issue, are like a duck paddling furiously simply to try to stand still There are some aspects of the Bill which we support, and I shall refer to these before coming to the parts we consider clumsy and potentially damaging.",3
"We support the establishment, although not the precise functions, of a Director of Labour Market Enforcement, who could provide much-needed strategic leadership in protecting the victims of labour market exploitation, but who should not also have any role connected to immigration control.",3
"We support the strengthening of sanctions for employers of illegal workers, which builds on the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2000.",3
"We also support the requirement for banks to carry out immigration status checks on current account holders, although it needs to provide sufficient redress for those wrongly identified, and the introduction of a duty on public authorities to ensure that all public sector workers in public-facing roles are able to speak fluent English I turn to our key but not only areas of concern, but make one general point.",3
"That is the apparent lack of hard evidence clarifying the extent or nature of the problems that the Government perceive as existing, and thus the need to take the kind of measures proposed in the Bill, or to show that the measures proposed in the Bill will, first, have the effect that the Government expect and, secondly, will not prove to be counterproductive and harm community cohesion The Bill’s overarching impact assessment is thin in terms of both pages and content, which suggests little quantifiable impact on reducing illegal immigration and even less assessment undertaken.",3
"There are references in the impact assessment to some financial savings but, as we consider the Bill, we will need to know by how much the Government expect each major measure to impact on illegal immigration and the hard evidence on which such expectations are based In that context, I assume that the reference in the Explanatory Notes of the purpose of the Bill being “to tackle illegal immigration” means, as far as the Government are concerned, reducing illegal immigration.",3
"No doubt that point can be clarified in the Minister’s response at the end of the debate, along with an indication of the criteria against which the Government intend subsequently to assess the success or otherwise of the Bill in delivering their declared objectives The Bill creates an offence of illegal working, although it is already an offence for a person who does not have leave to enter or remain to be in this country.",3
The Government do not appear to be claiming that this further criminal offence is needed to enable those who are working in this country illegally to be discovered and removed when without it they would not be.,3
"Rather, they are saying that this new criminal offence is being created because being able to catch such people under the new offence enables the earnings that they have made from working illegally to be seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 The actual need for this measure, what it will achieve in reality and how it will operate will have to be explored in Committee.",3
"It is those doing the employing and exploiting who should feel the full force of the law, not those being employed and exploited We need to find out whether the Government intend to prosecute all those found to be in breach of this new illegal working offence.",3
"How many people do the Government estimate are currently working illegally in this country in what will in future be breach of the new offence, and how many will be prosecuted for the new offence during each of the first three years during which it is on the statute book?",3
"How much money do the Government expect to seize in earnings from illegal workers during each of the first three years during which the new criminal offence of illegal working will be on the statute book, if the Bill is passed as it stands The new illegal working offence runs the real risk of further disempowering potentially vulnerable workers and empowering would-be exploiters, who will now have a further offence that they can remind those who they are employing they could be prosecuted for if they get the authorities.",3
Criminalising vulnerable or potentially vulnerable people through the proposed illegal working offence seems to cut right across these objectives.,3
"Since there are already criminal offence provisions relating to those who have breached the Immigration Rules, is there really a need to introduce a new criminal offence of illegal working, against which an employee who does not have the right immigration status has no defence at all The Bill also includes proposals to terminate support for asylum seekers and their children who have had their applications turned down and any appeal rejected but have not departed from this country within the required period of time.",3
"Perhaps the Minister could say what the anticipated amount is that would be paid out each year under this provision—namely new Section 95A—compared with the savings that would be made by withdrawing all existing support under Section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 Will the Minister also say what might count as a “genuine obstacle” to leaving the UK, and confirm that the reality is that the onus would be on the failed asylum seeker to somehow find and produce the evidence to prove their case?",3
"This risks increasing the chances that failed asylum seekers will abscond, again increasing the risk of vulnerable people—not least, the children of families affected—being exploited.",3
Terminating support might also make it more difficult for the Home Office to remain in contact with people liable for removal from the UK and undermine efforts to promote voluntary deportations.,3
Withdrawing support for this category of migrants seems like a threat of destitution as a means of enforcing the Immigration Rules A further issue is that of immigration detention.,3
What is needed is an independent review on immigration detention to be carried out within a short period of time once this Bill has come into force.,3
"It should consider the effectiveness and suitability of the law concerning immigration detention, including the merits of having a time limit.",3
I believe that I am right in saying that the UK is the only country—or about the only country—in Europe that does not have a time limit of any sort for immigration detention Another concern relates to the new criminal offence under the Bill for landlords and letting agents who do not comply with the right-to-rent scheme or fail to evict tenants who do not have the right to rent.,3
"In our view, potentially criminalising landlords in this fashion could lead to discrimination in the rental markets, as landlords play it safe over whom they accept as tenants when it comes to immigration status.",3
"Landlords themselves are calling for clarification that they will not be prosecuted where they have done everything reasonably possible to confirm the status of a tenant or where they are actively seeking to evict a tenant whom they have been told does not have the right to rent Among other provisions of the Bill that will need careful consideration of their justification and likely impact, including on children, is the power that the Secretary of State will have to certify the claim of someone appealing against an immigration decision—including on human rights grounds—so that they can appeal only from outside the UK The Bill also contains some measures in respect of border security.",3
"The Government maintain that they have control of our borders, but that seems highly questionable if the Government are arguing that one of the justifications for the proposals in the Bill is the level of illegal immigration.",3
It is clear that the resources provided for securing our borders are insufficient.,2
Perhaps the Minister could say what the Government’s estimate is of illegal immigration each year.,3
We will also during the passage of the Bill want to discuss the recommendations in the very recent report to the Government on overseas domestic workers I have set out our concerns about a number of what we regard as clumsy and potentially damaging provisions in the Bill.,3
"It will be for the Government to produce the hard evidence to show that their proposals are needed and justified; that they will deal with the problems that the Government say they are intended to address; and, most importantly, that they will avoid unintended consequences such as undermining the progress made on tackling modern slavery and human trafficking, leaving families—including children—destitute, and increasing the likelihood of discrimination in the workplace and housing market.",3
"If the Government cannot do this—and they certainly have not so far—we are in real danger of passing a Bill that, as it stands, would be counterproductive in respect of illegal immigration and would harm community cohesion.",3
"It will risk children’s welfare, turn citizens into enforcers through outsourcing and reduce the UK’s reputation in employment and other sectors—all of this, and more, without making any progress on a time limit for immigration detention, on family reunion, on integration and on community cohesion.",3
"When the Government are asked about relaxing the very restrictive rules, we are reminded that family visas can be issued outside the Immigration Rules on the basis of exceptional, compelling and compassionate circumstances—which is good to know, but how many have been issued?",3
"My second thought was: in view of the experiences of people caught up in, or driven out of, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Sudan and other countries, the situation is not exceptional My second example is the UN’s review of overseas domestic workers and their visas.",3
They do not even allow for a child asylum seeker who has arrived here alone to bring over his closest family.,2
"As for myself, with neither of those children, I want my country to work on safe routes for refugees.",3
"The Bill’s maritime enforcement powers beg the question of what is to be done to help the passengers—or victims—once a ship without nationality is stopped I was a member of the all-party group inquiry into immigration and detention, as were a number of other speakers today.",3
"I was struck then by the paradox at the heart of unlimited detention: the lack, one might even say deprivation, of hope—might detention last for ever?—coupled with uncertainty that tomorrow one might, without warning, be deported.",3
Sweden is one country where returns of unsuccessful asylum seekers is achieved more humanely and with a higher rate of voluntary returns.,3
The returns process will be another point of focus I appreciate that the Bill deals with immigration bail.,3
"Seeking asylum is not equivalent to the commission of an offence with a trial pending, as the term “bail” suggests.",3
"Though we have tried before, we will try again on the right for asylum seekers to work within a reasonable period of their arrival and in occupations not regarded by the Government as in shortage.",3
"For us, it is a matter of integration and not badging asylum seekers as “other” Many who have the right to work and come from other parts of the EU do not understand that they have rights and are vulnerable to exploitation.",2
"That is not a frivolous point as the GLA is a very strong brand I had thought that we might have a year without a criminal justice Bill, but of course we have the immigration-related offences.",3
"Some 17.5% of the UK population do not have a passport, and I suggest that there is likely to be a higher proportion of such people among those who are seeking rented accommodation.",3
"In the employment context, the new illegal working offence is something else that we believe will add to the vulnerability to exploitation.",3
Those powers will be extended from immigration officers trained as criminal investigators to all—but with what recourse?,3
"In the case of the police, as a comparison, there is the IPCC One of the “myths busted” in the Government’s information pack is that asylum support appeals are to be scrapped though 60% are currently allowed.",3
"Leaving aside for now challenging that assertion, I would not say that the figure given in the pack of 37% of appeals being dismissed is anything to boast about, nor is extending the cohort of migrants who must appeal from overseas.",3
New Section 95A says that support for asylum seekers whose application has failed can be by way of vouchers.,3
"The Red Cross reports on what is called the “move-on” following the grant of refugee status, and makes practical recommendations to avoid breaks in support, which I hope we can use the Bill to look at The House has a veritable army prepared to fight for children’s well-being.",3
"As the LGA says, no council should be made to choose between supporting unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and providing vital services for their local community.",3
"There are still resource issues to be sorted out, together with the Home Office—should it not be the DCLG, if anyone?—exercising powers of direction on local authorities Issues of support are the subject of most of the representations which I and, no doubt, others have received from individual members of the public, although I do not think any of them have described as disingenuous applying the Home Office term “simplify” to the basis of assessment and support of people with immigration status who are destitute What should our immigration policy say about our Government?",3
"My Lords, opinion polls suggest that immigration is the number one issue at the moment.",3
"For a long time post-war, there was almost no immigration in this country.",3
"In my view, it has therefore performed a valuable public service A level of immigration higher than, say, that of the 1980s or 1990s is probably inevitable in the globalised 21st century.",3
The fact is that controlled immigration brings many benefits to Britain and many immigrants have contributed a great deal to this country.,3
"However, the very large numbers that we have seen in recent years can, as the Home Secretary in her conference speech rightly said, damage social cohesion and national identity, as well as drive down the wages of the low paid, as evidenced by the recent Bank of England research, particularly in the service sector, where many of these problems are at their most acute What we have seen this year is not only large-scale immigration to Britain but mass immigration to Europe from failed states outside.",3
"In my view, that can be dealt with only by strong border controls, as well as diplomatic and military efforts to get some sort of governance back into failed states, plus international aid for the countries that need it It has always struck me that one of the problems with large-scale immigration is that it can damage not only the living standards of many of the poorest in the receiving country but the country the immigrants come from.",2
It goes hand in hand with a strong commitment to reduce immigration to more acceptable levels.,3
A combination of proper border controls and international aid is the right way to deal with this.,3
"That of course will take time, and the Bill does not attempt to deal with these broad issues; it is a relatively modest measure designed to deal with some of the more egregious problems thrown up by immigration As someone who has always supported a living wage as well as a minimum wage, I am strongly in favour of Part 1, which tackles illegal working and the exploitation of workers.",3
"I remember from my time as a Member of Parliament for Orpington appeals that went on for literally years and years, which is incredibly depressing for the people concerned and, indeed, harrowing for everybody I also support the measures to improve the language skills of immigrants who work in the public sector, and the charge on employers designed to improve the skills of the people they recruit.",3
"Employers, I am afraid, are often used to the easy solution of employing foreign workers rather than taking the trouble to train properly indigenous workers.",3
"Getting immigration back to reasonable levels will take time, possibly even as long as a decade.",3
"Perhaps I should also add that I was a refugee myself, during my childhood.",3
"There are, indisputably, benefits to this country from immigration, but the problem is that those benefits are spread over many parts of the country and certain communities have resulting pressures on hospitals, schools, housing and so on.",2
"It ought not to be beyond our ability and skills to make sure that the communities that are welcoming and accommodating refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants should be helped with resources out of the benefit that goes to the country as a whole from our extra GDP It is important that we try to win public opinion as opposed to adopting a policy that is hostile to immigration and asylum seekers and says that we do not want them here.",3
Of course we must have a sensible and controlled policy for immigration; of course we cannot have an open door.,2
"We never thought Germany would set standards of human rights that would be a model for the rest of Europe It is important that we have a sensible way of distinguishing between asylum seekers, under the 1951 convention, and people who seek to migrate for economic purposes.",3
"There is confusion between the two, because it depends a bit on how effective our determination of asylum seekers is.",3
I put it to the Minister that there are people who may not be deemed to be asylum seekers but who find it very unsafe to return to their countries.,3
It is no wonder that some of them are desperate not to return—it is unsafe—no matter what asylum determination processes we have.,3
"It is important that communities to which asylum seekers go, with the Government’s blessing, should be made to feel involved in the process so that they can be welcoming.",3
I urge the Government to consider a model of that sort when looking at the Syrian refugees.,3
The first is the importance of the pull factor in immigration and how best the Government should tackle it.,3
"Clause 55 gives the Secretary of State powers through subordinate regulations in the form of statutory instruments, of course, to, “require certain employers to pay an immigration skills charge for each skilled worker from outside the EEA that they sponsor” It is good to see some explicit recognition by the Government that the shortage of skills in our domestic jobs market acts as a powerful incentive for employers to recruit from abroad, thus pulling immigrants into Britain.",3
There has been too much emphasis on in-work benefits acting as a pull factor without the Government providing the evidence that this is a key incentive driving large numbers of immigrants.,3
"But our media are full of stories about shortages of skills within the UK, resulting in searches for qualified workers from overseas.",3
"The Commons Home Affairs Committee recently commented that the Government’s tier 2 migrant cap, “could have been responsible for a crisis in nurse recruitment”.",3
"There seems to be a complete absence of co-ordination across Government on this as the Home Office tightens controls on immigrants with skills while the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department for Education and others cut back on training for those already here I have worked in Bradford with a social housing association which runs, as part of its social responsibility agenda, a superb apprenticeship scheme for the various building trades which is enormously oversubscribed.",3
"Unless the Government take responsibility for the failings in our education and training systems, and their funding that contributes to the long-term skills shortages which drive inward immigration, they have no hope of reducing the determination of companies and public sector employers to recruit directly from abroad.",3
"Do the Conservatives regard marriage as important for the well-to-do, worthy even of offering tax concessions to encourage, but not worth investing public money into for those already marginal in our society My third point is about border security—Clauses 44 and 45.",3
"When I briefly answered on policing and anti-terrorism issues for the coalition Government in this House, I was struck by the unavoidably transnational nature of serious crime, including drug-smuggling, and the frequent use of private aircraft and private airstrips and heliports in pursuit of illegal activities.",3
"Is it assumed that these are used only by the rich, and can therefore be left outside our tighter border controls The Minister may know that I have asked specific Questions about Brecqhou helicopters, which fly the Barclay brothers to and fro from within the UK border control area—devolved in the case of Brecqhou to the Guernsey authorities, which I understand are strongly discouraged from ever setting foot on the island—and various parts of continental Europe.",3
"Are there others, including Russian oligarchs and Gulf royalty with homes across southern England, who fly from private helipads beyond border controls?",4
"Are we moving towards one set of border controls for ordinary people, and a far lighter regime for the super-rich?",3
"We cannot be sure that, “Persons excluded from the United Kingdom”— in Clause 46 might not be smuggled in by such means, as well as other illegal immigrants and undesirables My fourth point is about the impact of the tiered visa system on patterns of movement into and out of the country.",3
"The Minister will know that I have recently been concerned with a personal issue in this area, related to spouse visas for talented young Britons seeking to return to the UK after some years of study and work abroad.",3
"The Tier 1 (Investor) Visa is worthy of a tax haven, not a self-respecting sovereign country; it fits in with a housing regime which promotes sales of newly-built homes in London to overseas buyers before they have been offered to British citizens, and allows them to be bought through anonymous offshore companies I note that the Bill has no proposals to tighten controls on Tier 1 visas.",3
"Are the Conservative Government really determined, with Mayor Boris Johnson’s support, to build a country fit for foreign money-launderers to live in?",3
It seems easier for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Great Britain than for the young and talented to go through the eye of UK border controls.,4
"As a Liberal Democrat, I want better management of immigration and asylum than we have at present.",3
"On the subject of labour market provisions, it is necessary to clarify the primary purpose of the Director of Labour Market Enforcement as being to enforce the rights of workers and to protect people from exploitation, and not to confuse this with immigration control.",3
The introduction of a criminal offence of illegal working is a very bad idea.,2
I prefer the term “irregular migrants” to “illegal migrants”.,3
"During consideration of the Bill in Committee in the Commons, the Immigration Minister, James Brokenshire, confirmed that the primary response to the discovery that an individual is in the UK illegally is to seek to remove them, rather than to pursue a prosecution.",3
"Given that, is this new offence not just political posturing Making illegal working a crime creates a perfect environment for exploitation because it will deter exploited workers from coming forward and militate against the Government’s work to combat trafficking, slavery and labour exploitation.",3
"The Home Secretary claimed, in the other place, that vulnerable people such as trafficking victims would not be punished because the Modern Slavery Act would continue to apply.",3
"Many employers organise visas and so on for their employees, who may fall foul of these new provisions through no fault of their own.",3
Does there really need to be criminalisation of illegal working in order to use proceeds of crime powers to confiscate the wages of illegal workers?,3
"Will the proceeds not exceed the costs On the subject of access to services, the right-to-rent scheme, making landlords into immigration officers on pain of criminal sanctions, is objectionable on several grounds.",3
"The provision for landlords to evict tenants without a court possession order removes a crucial due process safeguard which protects against erroneous decision-making On the subject of support for asylum seekers, the provisions in the Bill which attempt to create a hostile environment to force people into leaving voluntarily are very worrying indeed.",3
There is a real risk that refused asylum-seeking families will fall through the gaps.,3
"As to the practical objections, the Home Office’s own evidence, including from the pilot a decade ago, strongly suggests that cutting families off from support will be ineffective in making them more likely to leave the UK, so the Government simply will not achieve their stated objective People cut off from support are more likely to abscond and go underground, putting them out of reach of the authorities and undermining the very immigration controls that these headline-grabbing proposals are supposed to enforce.",3
"The best solution is to give asylum-seekers permission to work—even an obligation to work, if fit—if they have waited more than six months for a decision I have observations on two themes which run through the Bill.",3
"Outsourcing immigration control to landlords, banks and the DVLA is not commensurate with the idea of reducing red tape.",3
"Local authorities will get more bureaucracy in regard to language requirements, asylum seeker and child support and notification of licences, as well as greater expense.",3
Businesses will have the immigration skills charge.,3
"The need is to get better Home Office management of asylum and immigration instead, not least by speeding up full monitoring of both entry and exit.",3
"The extra powers proposed for immigration, detainee custody and prison officers—such as to search and seize documents including driving licences, and for speculative in-country stops and closing premises—all need firm scrutiny.",3
"This is reflected in the provisions on summary eviction of a tenant on the basis of a notice from the Home Secretary, enforceable in the same way as a High Court order, and the extension of “deport first, appeal later”.",3
"My Lords, I declare immediately that I am involved with a number of charities dealing with refugee matters: the Cardinal Hume Centre already referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and Women for Refugee Women—I am a patron of both.",3
"It is also the UK section of the International Commission of Jurists Luckily, we have a whole set of wonderful researchers and young lawyers who work for us, who have been looking avidly at the Bill because of concern expressed to Justice by practitioners and others—lawyers who are members of Justice who are concerned about the Bill’s implications for our society I say immediately in tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, who is one of the great moral voices in this House, that his is the speech I would have liked to have made in this debate, because he speaks about the actual experience of people, the need for us never to lose our compassion when dealing with the issue of immigration and how we must remember the stories.",3
"We are very concerned about a number of the provisions, and recommend that the offence of illegal working be removed from the Bill altogether.",3
I say that because we already have power to deal with people who are here illegally.,2
"To confiscate what are usually miserable, meagre, lowly earnings from those people seems to me a terrible statement of where we have got to with immigration issues Justice also recommends that the offence of leasing premises to those disqualified from renting be removed from the Bill, pending a comprehensive evaluation of the law that we introduced only a year ago and which, as others have mentioned, has introduced a whole civil process for people who are leasing premises to those who should not be in the country.",3
People with a foreign name who apply for housing and approach letting agencies already face problems even getting on to lists and seeing premises.,2
"We could put such an amendment into the Bill, but we should be most concerned about the idea that there should be a readily available right for the Secretary of State to overcome a court’s decision, given what that means for the rule of law Justice also recommends that the proposal to extend the “deport first, appeal later” powers to all human rights-based immigration appeals should be a source of alarm to anyone who cares about the law and the rule of law.",3
"Of course we have to have proper immigration procedures and systems, and they should be clear and just; but they have to be imbued with humanity and decency.",2
"Not only are we faced with a very similar set of measures to those in the 2014 Act, but also the Bill includes a second savage cut in asylum support this year and, yet again, a parallel consultation is taking place on charging migrants for healthcare, including some emergency treatment.",3
"As if the 2014 Act did not create a hostile enough environment for so-called illegal migrants—a term that bodies such as the General Assembly of the UN committed not to use; I will refer instead to “undocumented” migrants because no person is illegal—organisations on the ground warn that this Bill will make Britain an even more hostile and suspicious place for all migrants and their descendants I am grateful for the bumper bundle of official information that appeared on my desk last week, but the sunny picture it paints bears no resemblance to that detailed in the copious briefings we received, for which I am also grateful—though I will not be able to do them justice.",3
"As the Conservative MP Richard Fuller warned, “the problem is that it is very difficult for someone to see that a person is an illegal immigrant.",3
"In the name of combating exploitation, some of the Bill’s provisions are likely to increase it, as we have heard, and, as has been argued, the withdrawal of the asylum support from appeal-exhausted families with children will without doubt mean destitution for all too many of them It was my original intention to speak solely about asylum support as I feel so strongly about this, particularly following the shabby and shameful cut in support for children that we debated in October.",3
"In its two reports on the last immigration Bill, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I was then a member, raised serious concerns on human rights grounds about out-of-country appeals.",3
"There are also concerns about family separation and fears that the best interests of the child will not be given primary consideration as required by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, despite the Minister’s reassurances Rights of Women is worried about the implications for women migrants who have left abusive partners but who do not qualify to remain under the normal domestic violence rules because of their status, which is a common occurrence.",3
"Rights of Women warns that its extension and intensification could disproportionately affect women fleeing abusive partners, regardless of their nationality With regard to discriminatory effects, will the Minister give an assurance that the new language requirements for customer-facing public sector workers will not be used against those whose first language is British Sign Language, and commit to include a clear statement to that effect in the code of practice, as requested by Sense Turning back to the right to rent, there are also fears that it would make undocumented migrants more vulnerable to exploitation by rogue landlords.",3
Exploitation can also be one result of the removal of asylum support from appeal-exhausted asylum seekers unless they can demonstrate destitution and a genuine obstacle to leaving the UK.,3
"Despite widespread opposition to the use of prospective destitution to incentivise voluntary return, the Bill steamed ahead with the original proposal just six days after the consultation closed The language of “incentives” is constantly used as justification, as if asylum seekers personified economically rational man in their decision-making.",3
"Such thinking was challenged by a Centre for Social Justice working group some years ago, and the overwhelming evidence from organisations working with asylum seekers shows just how misplaced it is.",3
"There are also limitations on support for care leavers subject to immigration control, who are referred to as “adults” as though somehow the vulnerabilities faced by care leavers who turn 18, long recognised in law and policy, will magically dissolve I have received many emails from organisations and individuals asking me to speak today because of their concerns, particularly around asylum support.",3
One is deportation before an appeal is heard.,3
I am rather doubtful about the safeguards that are sometimes mentioned by the spokesmen on behalf of the Government My second concern is the position in which some whose asylum appeal is refused are left.,3
"I have recently been involved, through the Refugee Council, in a case of a young Afghan who was an unaccompanied child refugee from Afghanistan at the age of seven.",4
"However, when he was 17 and a half he had to apply for asylum, which was refused.",3
It must be very difficult for someone who was seven years old when they became a refugee to prove that they would be persecuted.,3
"For four years, while his status was uncertain, he lived in fear of deportation back to Afghanistan, where he knew no one and had no prospects of a job; indeed, he was no longer familiar with speaking an Afghan language Deportation is not often carried out, but Channel 4 showed a memorable film of a young man in a similar plight who was deported and taken away from loving foster parents, ending up as a drug addict living under a bridge in Kabul.",3
People seeking asylum do not have permission to work in the UK and thus are forced to rely on support provided by the Home Office.,3
"This consists of accommodation given on a no-choice basis and just £5.28 a day to cover food, clothing, toiletries, travel, communication and all other necessities Even under the current system many refused asylum seekers in the UK do not currently qualify for the limited Home Office support or have to wait for long periods to access this support.",3
I am told that the British Red Cross has supported thousands of asylum seekers and their dependants in this situation in the United Kingdom so far this year.,3
"My third concern, which I shall refer to very briefly, is the extraordinary proposal to make illegal employment a crime not only for the employer but for the employee.",3
What illegal employee will dare to reveal the condition of near slavery in which he or she is employed if they fear that they will be prosecuted or will lose whatever meagre earnings they may have saved?,3
Control of illegal employment will be infinitely more difficult This is another in a series of ineffective immigration Bills.,2
Making the landlord criminally responsible—if I may put it like that—for staying up to date with his or her tenant’s immigration status puts him or her in the invidious position of taking on the mantle of immigration officer and border control officer.,3
"Who will take the risk of letting accommodation to an Imran Khan, on a student visa, when faced with a possible prison sentence if they get it wrong?",3
"In a former role as caseworker for my noble friend Lady Kramer when she was in another place, I dealt with a number of immigration cases.",3
"It is as inevitable as night follows day St Mungo’s Broadway, a charity working with 25,000 homeless people across London, the south-east, the south-west and the Home Counties, states: “Homelessness often results in the loss of ID documents and many vulnerable people will not have a passport or be readily able to provide other ID documents required to rent or renew their existing tenancy” St Mungo’s Broadway’s figures for services working with rough sleepers show that in Westminster last year, counting only UK nationals and Irish clients, 49% had no ID.",3
Will the Minister look into making this task a little easier for charities involved in helping homeless vulnerable people to rebuild their lives There is also concern about the deterrent effect of applying the right to rent scheme to households who take in lodgers and to charitable families who offer a spare room to refugees and homeless migrants while their application is being considered.,3
"These hosting schemes are extremely important for helping people to avoid destitution while they go through the process of regularising their situation or preparing to return to their home country and who are otherwise not entitled to any support A couple of weeks ago, I met a newly arrived young Syrian who had recently been granted refugee status.",3
I fear that families will be deterred from coming forward to offer spare rooms to destitute asylum seekers and refugees for fear of falling foul of the law.,3
"More and more people will be forced to sleep rough on the streets The concern is that the Home Office’s record on dealing with immigration leaves something to be desired, and there is concern about its ability to deal promptly with inquiries from landlords and indeed employers.",3
"It will be useful to have some evidence of whether existing measures are succeeding in tackling illegal immigration or whether the effect is to drive illegal immigrants further underground, increasing homelessness and providing easy pickings for unscrupulous landlords I have similar reservations about the measures in Part 1 on the labour market and illegal working.",3
I seek reassurance from the Minister that the role of the Director of Labour Market Enforcement is unconnected to the role of immigration control The many other measures contained in other parts of the Bill could have serious adverse effects on the lives of innocent people who have inadvertently fallen foul of the law or who have suffered from wrong or tardy information from the Home Office.,3
"The loss of a driving licence, the loss of a car, the suspension of a bank account, the loss of documents and the inability even to represent oneself at an immigration appeal hearing will devastate and, in some cases, destroy lives What will be the effect of stopping drivers to ask for their driving licence?",3
So I ask the Government: is this a good time to create a hostile environment for much-needed migrant workers?,3
"We saw refugees from Syria being welcomed to the Isle of Bute, and I am proud of some Canadian connections when we hear that Justin Trudeau promised that Canada, under its new Liberal Government, will welcome 25,000 refugees by the end of February.",3
"Last week when the first plane arrived in Toronto, the call went out: “Please do not go to the airport: too many people are already there welcoming the refugees”.",3
"One of the provisions of the Bill is the “deport now, appeal later” system.",3
It could have provided an end to the deportation of 18 year-olds who may have come here as unaccompanied children.,3
"Some 225 such deportations have taken place in the past year, and in more than half of them there was violence in the deportation process because the person being deported was totally panic-stricken.",3
We have already heard how the United Kingdom is to recommend its European neighbours not to have a time limit on the detention of immigrants.,3
In the UK our unlimited detention laws mean that in 2013 some 400 immigrants were detained for more than six months.,3
"If an amendment is brought forward for a possible maximum period of 28 days, I will be more than happy to support it We also have the threat that all payments and benefits will be removed if an asylum appeal fails.",3
"The Government say that it will encourage asylum seekers to return to their home countries—where they face death, starvation, or becoming the victims of extreme terrorism.",3
"The whole thing is ludicrous Put simply, this Immigration Bill achieves the Home Secretary’s aim of creating a hostile environment for innocent immigrants.",3
"The Bill also breaches Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, as well as Supreme Court rulings made in 2013 The sight of refugee families, including children and old people, trudging hundreds of miles in search of some hope which they are being denied in Syria or wherever it might be, should move us.",3
"If we talk about cutting asylum support, we have already heard how desperate it is for so many people.",3
"We have already heard about all the missing children and the fears that people have about them being part of trafficking schemes We have heard stories from individuals on how they have been forced to enter criminality to support themselves and their families, yet they have still not wished to return to their own countries.",3
"There has been great discussion about economic migrants and refugees, and in my view we are still not clear where the line lies.",3
"It is easy to talk in terms of economic migrants and people seeking a better life when that hides the fact that people are fleeing war, desperate circumstances, torture and possibly death.",3
We on this side believe that asylum seekers should be able to work.,3
There are also things like illegal driving.,3
"Many noble Lords have already referred to the right to rent scheme, which makes it an offence for landlords to rent accommodation to illegal immigrants in this country.",3
"I accept that the whole issue of immigration, and the circumstances it raises, are considerations of key importance to many people in this country—I do not deny that for one moment.",3
"Successive Governments in this country have failed to build affordable houses, so we cannot lay that at the door of migrants.",2
"Again, we cannot lay that at the door of migrants.",3
"For centuries, there have been waves of immigration into our country, going back to the Angles and Saxons, the Normans, Huguenots and Jews.",4
"Later, there were migrants from Africa, the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent.",3
"The danger then is anti-immigrant prejudice, bigotry and xenophobia.",2
"We have seen eruptions of that all too close to home in some European countries When people from overseas are here illegally, this creates real problems.",2
"The Government are right to want to deal with the problem of unscrupulous employers who exploit illegal immigrants, who often end up having to work for very low wages in dangerous and degrading conditions.",2
This is obviously important for practical reasons but it is also vital for integration into British society.,3
"I suspect we will not know for some time how effective it is More generally, the Bill is seeking to tighten up existing measures to deal with illegal immigration.",3
"Everybody, illegal immigrants or otherwise, must always be treated with dignity.",2
Does the Minister believe that any further training of immigration officers or others will be necessary?,3
"To contrast the nature of the Bill with the character of the Minister, if I may use a corrupted 1970s cliché, “What’s a nice bloke like the Minister doing with a Bill like this?” Let me say clearly and unequivocally at the outset that Liberal Democrats support proper immigration control.",3
"Apparently, 8% of workers in the UK are from overseas, which is the average for the European Union as a whole, but in Ireland it is 11%.",3
"My noble friend Lady Sheehan quoted the president of the National Black Police Association regarding the negative impact of the Bill on what is already a hostile environment in this country towards black and minority ethnic people in general, and migrants in particular, as evidenced by recent hate crime figures.",3
The police decided to move away from immigration enforcement on the grounds of improving community relations.,3
"As the Race Equality Foundation briefing says, there is the potential in the Bill to set us back 30 years in race relations, although I would not go as far as the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, on that point To get down to specific issues, starving asylum seekers who have reached the end of the road with their asylum applications is not something that this country should be doing.",3
"There was a trial of Section 9 of the asylum and immigration Act of 2004, which removed all support from those who had run out of road, and 39% of those families disappeared compared with 21% of those who continued to get support.",3
"As he said, the Red Cross has helped 10,000 asylum seekers in the past 12 months As far as the right to rent is concerned, the Liberal Democrats reluctantly agreed in the coalition to conduct a pilot scheme on it, in the belief that the evaluation of that pilot would show that it was not worth pursuing.",3
"Even Syrian and Afghan families who are already settled in the UK are not being allowed to take in family members who are currently stranded in Europe There is nothing in the Bill about the unlimited administrative detention of migrants, at the cost of £40,000 per detainee per year.",3
"Although I note the comments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, surely there must at least be judicial involvement in these cases after 28 days—convicted foreign criminals are of course a separate issue.",3
"The right of asylum seekers to work where there is no decision after six months will clearly reduce the burden on the public purse, and surely we are more likely to be able to keep tabs on these people if they have social ties than if they do not.",3
The Secretary of State has the power to order asylum seekers to move from one local authority to another.,3
"Does the Minister not see the contradiction As far as skills shortages in this country are concerned, as my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire highlighted, the Bill will introduce a new immigration skills charge, which will apply to employers sponsoring non-EEA nationals who come to the UK under tier 2 of the points-based system.",3
"Will we know these details before the end of our deliberations in this House, or does the Minister want the House to write the Government a blank cheque As my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire also pointed out, the Bill changes the Government’s fee-raising powers in respect of civil registration, including that of births, marriages, deaths and passports.",3
"The reasons given in the government briefing include to allow such services to be “self-sufficient”, which is fair enough, and to have passport fees that, “better reflect the costs incurred”, for example the costs of processing “complex applications”.",3
"But then it says, “to allow some passport fees to be set at above cost” Can the Minister tell the House which type of passport applications they intend to make a profit out of?",3
"My Lords, I want an immigration system that is fair and just to British citizens and those who want to come here, play by the rules and make a contribution to our society.",3
"My noble friend Lord Rosser made clear at the start of his speech our concern at many aspects of the Bill There are, of course, parts of the Bill we welcome, as well as parts we have serious concerns about, but before focusing on its provisions, it is worth putting on record how much this country has benefited from immigration.",3
"Look at one institution, our NHS, which would be in considerable difficulty if it were not for the immigrants who have come to this country to provide the services that we rely on.",2
"We heard about that in the contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire How many of your Lordships are immigrants yourselves, or the children or grandchildren of immigrants?",3
I am the eldest son of immigrants.,3
"In 2014, the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration, when looking at the fiscal effects of immigration on the UK, estimated that migrants contributed about £25 billion to the economy between 2001 and 2011 Part 1 of the Bill is about tackling illegal working and preventing the exploitation of workers.",3
"The illegal labour market can have a very detrimental effect on the pay and conditions of legally employed workers, and a very damaging one on reputable businesses that are playing by the rules.",2
"My noble friend Lord Rosser made clear our concern about criminalising illegal workers, as did many other noble Lords today Part 2 concerns access to services.",3
"Asking landlords to carry out reasonable checks of identity documents, as they already do, is perfectly acceptable, but it must be understood that landlords are not immigration officers.",4
"The punishment of up to and including five years’ imprisonment for committing such offences is certainly very tough There is also concern that by not striking the right balance, the Government run the risk of landlords just deciding to play it safe and renting only to people with British passports, thereby creating a whole new area of discrimination and injustice, whereby people with foreign names, foreign paperwork or foreign passports are routinely refused accommodation.",3
Will the Minister comment on this proposal when he responds Part 3 of the Bill concerns the expansion of the powers of immigration officers.,3
"We will probe and explore these powers further during the passage of the Bill, but we support the notion that immigration officers need to have adequate powers to enable them to undertake their duties effectively and to seize evidence that may relate to non-immigration offences.",3
"It includes a major extension of the “deport first, appeal later” provisions for foreign national offenders in all human rights claims.",3
"Will the Minister tell the House why we should give any organisation such powers, when 50% of its initial decisions in immigration matters are found to be wrong?",3
What is the current backlog of immigration cases that the department is struggling to cope with?,3
"My noble friend Lady Kennedy of the Shaws, who has considerable knowledge and experience of this area of law, set out much more eloquently than I can the difficulties and problems that the “deport first, appeal later” provisions could present Part 5 of the Bill makes a number of changes to the way local authorities assess and provide accommodation and subsistence support for destitute families with immigration status.",3
"That equally applies to vulnerable people whose immigration status may not be in order; while they are in the United Kingdom, people deserve the protection of the law no matter what their status.",4
"I join with the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, in urging the Minister to use his considerable skills to persuade his colleagues of the need to change this part of the Bill Part 6 of the Bill deals with border security and would introduce a civil penalty regime to be applied to airlines and port operators who allow passengers to disembark without being presented to immigration control officers.",3
It also gives certain immigration officers powers that can be used in UK territorial waters.,3
"Again, I say to the Minister that the proper resourcing of our borders could make significant inroads into some of the problems the Bill tries to address, but in a manner that makes life difficult for some very vulnerable people and is not based on any sound evidence or evaluation of the problem and its possible solutions.",3
"I do not believe that the Government have proper control of our borders, particularly at ports, and this problem needs to be addressed.",2
The report of the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration on illegal working and immigration removals has just been published.,3
"The Shaw report on immigration and detention, which I know is of significant concern, will be published in early January—certainly by the time we reach Committee There will also be a Migration Advisory Committee report on the operation of tier 2, in addition to the Home Affairs Select Committee report.",3
The Government’s response to the consultation on reforming support for failed asylum seekers and other illegal migrants is another basis for our legislation.,3
"I want to put on record that there has been a significant amount of evidence gathering to build the case for the actions we propose here Turning to the policy, one thing we tend to be in general agreement about is that there is an issue with illegal immigration into the country.",3
"I was very moved by the words of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and others who spoke of the plight of those refugees.",3
"None of us, at this time in particular when we remember another refugee in a foreign land fleeing persecution, should be immune to acknowledging the tremendous pain and anguish that many people face in these countries.",3
People who come to this country in search of help enter our asylum system.,2
All Governments —coalition and Labour—have a proud track record of offering sanctuary to those people fleeing in fear of persecution Then there are those people who circumvent the immigration procedures and are found not to be genuine asylum seekers when their claim is tested through the appeals process and tribunal service.,3
"The recent report by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration commented on the Government’s success in our aim of year-on-year increases in confirmed voluntary departures every year since 2012-13 On border security, the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, asked a specific question about private helipads.",3
"Both these categories of appeal could involve human rights claims On the point about family reunion, which was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lords, Lord Hylton and Lord Dubs, we recognise that families may become fragmented because of the nature of conflict and persecution, and the speed and manner in which those seeking asylum often flee their country of origin.",3
"Our policy allows the immediate family members of a person granted refugee leave or humanitarian protection in the UK, their spouse or partner and children under the age of 18 who formed part of the family unit before the sponsor fled the country, to reunite with them.",4
"We have granted over 21,000 family reunion visas over the past five years, 2010-14.",3
"The Government recognise the need to be flexible so as not to disadvantage, for example, the minority of British citizens who do not hold a passport On detention, I have given an undertaking that Stephen Shaw’s review, which I know is eagerly awaited, will be published before we reach the relevant stage in Committee, while our response will be published before the clause on immigration bail is debated.",3
"While there is no fixed time limit to immigration detention—in fact, that is a matter that was discussed in previous legislation—there are well-established principles set out in case law, known as the Hardial Singh principles, which state that for detention under immigration powers to be lawful there must be, “a realistic prospect of removal within a reasonable timescale … Detention must be used sparingly, and for the shortest period necessary” An arbitrary time limit would potentially allow criminals and non-compliant individuals to play the system, as it were, which was a point raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood At that point, I shall draw my remarks to a conclusion.",3
"Since 2011, we have taken more than 5,000 Syrian refugees and asylum seekers, and last week, the Prime Minister announced that we will resettle 20,000 Syrians in need of protection over the course of this Parliament I can tell the House that plans to welcome those refugees are progressing at pace.",3
He will also report to the Secretary of State for International Development on the provision of support and assistance to Syrian refugees in the region.,3
Friend the Immigration Minister will continue to be responsible for our asylum system for Syrians and people of all nationalities who need our protection.,3
"Friend’s first commitments will be to host a meeting of non-governmental organisations to agree with our partners how best to harness the strong desire expressed by the public, and a range of organisations, to welcome these refugees to the UK.",3
"This team is working closely with local authorities across the UK to ensure that refugees will have the support and care they need locally on arrival Last Friday, I chaired a cross-Government meeting that brought together the Secretaries of State for Communities and Local Government, for Work and Pensions, for International Development, for Education, and for the Wales and Scotland Offices, as well as Ministers from five other Government Departments and representatives from the Local Government Association, to drive forward this important work.",3
"On Monday in Brussels I spoke to the UNHCR, António Guterres, who welcomed our decision to take more refugees from the region and gave his full support to the Government’s plan In welcoming vulnerable refugees to the UK, it is imperative that we have in place the support and help they need and deserve.",3
"As I have said before, the UK believes that this approach risks encouraging even more people to risk their lives making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean or into Europe Instead, we should, as the UK is doing, be resettling people directly from the region, including Syrian refugees from Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, such as those the Prime Minister met on his visit to the region on Monday.",3
"The UK will, however, continue to build on the considerable practical assistance we are already providing to the member states experiencing particular pressures, and help them to build functioning asylum systems with the resilience to withstand increased pressures.",3
We are also committed to supporting our European partners in ensuring the full and proper management of the EU’s external border I set out our strong support for the Commission’s hotspots proposals for screening centres in the parts of Europe most acutely affected at the moment.,3
These centres will identify those in need of international protection and give them quick access to asylum procedures.,3
"Those who are not in need of protection will be rapidly returned to their countries of origin, relieving the huge pressure which unfounded claims put on member states’ asylum systems, and ensuring that our protection can be given to those who really need it The strain of such claims must be addressed.",3
Claiming asylum must not be viewed as an easy means of settlement in Europe.,2
"Now more than ever we need asylum systems that can respond quickly to those genuinely in need, and all available resource must be directed appropriately.",2
"We need to ensure that all possible information and intelligence, including from migrant debriefing, is shared across Europe and with Europol We also want to see the EU and its international partners take forward more ambitious efforts under initiatives such as the Khartoum and Rabat processes and the proposed multi-purpose centre in Niger.",3
These should include concrete actions aimed at combating the people smugglers and returning illegal economic migrants The plight of so many Syrian refugees who have been left homeless and whose lives have been shattered is simply heart wrenching.,3
I hope the whole House will join me in sending a message of welcome to those refugees who will soon be arriving in this country and I commend the statement to the House.,3
I thank the Home Secretary for updating the House on the refugee crisis and welcome the further measures she has announced today.,3
"More than half a million migrants have arrived at the EU’s borders this year, about double the number that came in 2014.",3
"Earlier this week, four babies, six boys and five girls were among 34 victims who lost their lives after their boat capsized between Turkey and a small Greek island.",3
"Although the appointment earlier this week of a Minister with specific responsibilities is a welcome and sensible development, we now need clarity on the headline figures The Government have committed to 4,000 refugees a year, although the Prime Minister has suggested it could be more this year.",3
Does it adequately describe the people—the desperate parents carrying children at the Hungarian border and the children sleeping on the streets in Greece?,3
Is the Government’s decision not to take any refugees from Europe sustainable from a moral and practical point of view?,3
One of the problems the summit will have to address is the management of borders within Europe.,3
"What is her view on Germany’s decision to reintroduce border controls, and what implications does she think that will have for the Schengen agreement Will the Home Secretary say more about the proposal for removal centres in transit countries in Africa?",3
"Is the approach of moving people back to transit centres consistent with the principle set out in the Dublin convention, whereby people have the right to claim asylum in the country of arrival Is the EU in discussion with other countries across the middle east to increase what they are doing?",3
"As I explained in last week’s debate, we are working with the UNHCR and have expanded the criteria of vulnerability that will be used to identify refugees to come to the United Kingdom.",3
They have already been working with local authorities across the country and looking at the offers and the capacity of various councils to receive refugees.,3
"Friend the Minister with responsibility for Syrian refugees will address at a granular level in his discussions, making sure that those offers are being made and that they give the correct support The right hon.",3
"As I indicated in my statement, we have been supporting asylum systems in Greece, initially as part of the Greek action plan but also subsequent to that.",3
"That is why it is right that we are the second biggest bilateral aid donor to those in refugee camps and communities in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey.",3
They are part of the EU’s collective support for those countries and provide a system whereby people who cross the border can be properly identified and registered.,4
"Those who are claiming asylum appropriately are identified, but it is those who are illegal economic migrants that we are talking about returning to their countries of origin.",3
Friend is absolutely right about the gangs smuggling in refugees and illegal economic migrants.,2
"Of course, the business of some people smugglers is taking money from people and putting them on a boat that they know will probably sink in the Mediterranean, while others are human traffickers who want not just to put somebody on the journey but to ensure they are met when they arrive and are taken into some vile form of slavery.",3
"We constantly look at our effort on this, and I am pleased we have now confirmed in his place the independent anti-slavery commissioner, Kevin Hyland, who has been working with countries—in Africa, for example—looking at this terrible trade of human trafficking.",3
"Ministers will be aware of the incident last week at Killingholme, in my constituency, when 51 illegal immigrants were apprehended following a successful operation by Border Force.",3
"Can the Secretary of State assure me that adequate provision will be made for future incidents of this type, and that the legal process will not in any way hinder their speedy deportation?",3
"Amendment 19, page 5, line 2, leave out clause 8 To omit the clause on the new illegal working offence and maintain the status quo.",3
"Amendment 20, in clause 8, page 5, line 9, after “if” insert “without reasonable cause” To provide for a defence against the offence of illegal working.",3
"Amendment 33, in clause 9, page 7, line 11, leave out subsection (1) and insert— “(1) In section 21 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (offence of knowingly employing illegal worker), leave out subsection (1) and substitute— (1) A person commits an offence if he knowingly or recklessly employs an adult subject to immigration control, where— (a) this adult has not been granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, or (b) this adult’s leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom— (i) is invalid, (ii) has ceased to have effect (whether by reason of curtailment, revocation, cancellation, passage of time or otherwise), or (iii) is subject to a condition preventing him from accepting the employment.” To restrict the criminal offence of “employing illegal worker” to where this has been done “knowingly or recklessly”.",3
"Amendment 47, page 7, line 36, in clause 10, leave out “Scotland or” Removes the power for the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to illegal working extending to Scotland.",3
"Amendment 48, page 7, leave out line 41 Prevents the Secretary of State making regulations that confer functions on Scottish Ministers in relation to illegal working.",3
"Amendment 51, in clause 11, page 8, line 13, leave out “Scotland or” Removes the power for the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to illegal working in relation to private hire vehicles extend to Scotland.",3
"Amendment 52, page 8, leave out line 18 Prevents the Secretary of State making regulations that confer functions on Scottish Ministers in relation to illegal working relating to private hire vehicles.",3
"Amendment 46, in clause 13, page 9, line 31, at end insert— ‘(5A) A landlord will not commit an offence under subsection (1) if— (a) the landlord enters a residential tenancy agreement with an organisation or person who is supporting an adult mentioned in in subsection (2); (b) the rental payment received by the landlord as a result of this tenancy does not significantly exceed the costs that are incurred by the landlord for having the adult occupy the premises.” Ensures that a landlord who has agreed by working with an organisation/charity to provide accommodation to support failed asylum seekers are exempt from committing an offence.",3
"Amendment 21, in clause 58, page 50, line 9, at end insert— ‘(2A) Section 13 shall come into force subject to the conditions set out subsection (2B) (2B) The Secretary of State must prepare and publish an evaluation of the national implementation of provisions contained in sections 20 to 37 and Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 2014, and must lay a copy of the report before Parliament (2C) The report in subsection (2B) must include an assessment of the impact of those provisions on— (a) individuals who have a protected characteristic as defined in Part 2, Chapter 1 of the Equality Act 2010, and (b) British citizens who do not hold a passport or UK driving licence.” This amendment would require the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament an evaluation of the national roll out of the 2014 Right to Rent Scheme before the new offences in clause 13 come into force.",3
"New clause 8—Detention of persons—exempted persons— In paragraph 16 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971, after subsection (4) insert— “(5) A person may not be detained under this paragraph if they are— (a) a woman who— (i) states that she is pregnant, where this is confirmed to be the case or, (ii) is reasonably suspected to be pregnant by an immigration officer; (b) a person whose initial claim for asylum to the United Kingdom was based on being a victim of one of the following: (i) human trafficking; (ii) torture; (iii) sexual violence; (c) a member of any other group as may be prescribed in regulations by the Secretary of State.” This amendment would provide that pregnant women, people who claimed asylum as victims of trafficking, torture or sexual violence, and any other group prescribed by the Secretary of State, may not be detained pending an examination or decision by an immigration officer.",3
"New clause 9—Time limit on detention— In paragraph 16 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 after subsection (4) insert— “(5) Subject to subsection (6), no person shall be detained under this paragraph for more than 28 days (6) Subsection (5) shall not apply where the person detained under this paragraph has a criminal conviction with a sentence of imprisonment for three months or more.” This amendment provides that people shall not be detained pending an examination/a decision by an immigration officer for more than 28 days, unless they have a criminal conviction.",3
"New clause 13—Review of Immigration Detention— “(1) Before the end of the period of three months beginning on the day on which subsection (1) of section 32 comes into force, the Secretary of State must commission a report on detention under paragraph 16 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 that addresses the following matters— (a) the process for, and detail of, introducing a statutory maximum limit of 28 days on the length of time an individual can be detained under that paragraph; (b) how to reduce the number of people detained under that paragraph; (c) how to minimise the length of time an individual is detained under that paragraph; (d) the effectiveness of detention in meeting the Secretary of State’s objectives; and (e) the effectiveness of procedures to review decisions to detain and to continue to detain (2) The Report must be published by a panel appointed by the Secretary of State (3) The panel appointed under subsection (2) must be independently chaired (4) On completion of the report, the Chair of the panel must send it to the Secretary of State (5) The Secretary of State must lay before parliament a copy of the report received under subsection (4).” Reflecting the unanimous agreement of the House of Commons to the recommendations of the joint APPG on Refugees and APPG on Migration inquiry into immigration detention, the new clause requires the Secretary of State to appoint an independently-chaired panel to consider the issues raised therein and report to Parliament within three months of Schedule 7 to the Bill coming into force.",3
"Amendment 32, in schedule 7, page 97, line 22, at end insert— “(2A) The Secretary of State must grant a person bail if a person is detained under a provision mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) after no later than the 28 day following that on which the person was detained.” To introduce a 28 day time limit on the amount of time a person can be kept in immigration detention.",3
"I agree that we need to enforce the immigration rules and laws that we have put in place, but the problem is that the resources and manpower are not being put in to do that.",2
"I suggest that some of the rules already go far too far New clause 16 is a modest response to clause 13, which creates wide powers for immigration officials to close premises for 48 hours before any court involvement is required in certain cases of suspected illegal working.",3
"Provision for statutory compensation, which our amendment would introduce, is designed to ensure that notices are not issued in an oppressive manner by immigration officials New clause 17 is without doubt the more significant of the two new clauses.",3
"We also fully back their amendments 23 to 26, which would remove the obscene proposals that would see landlords and landladies turned into not only immigration officers but High Court judges, and would see summary evictions without judicial oversight I know that my hon.",3
"Right to rent is not evidence-based, but in fact flies in the face of the evidence provided by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, and indeed parts of the Government’s own pilot review.",3
"It is unfair to place these duties and now criminal sanctions on landlords, and it will lead to inadvertent discrimination or racism, with foreign nationals and even British citizens without documents at risk of being rejected from a tenancy whenever there is a safe and easy option of a British passport holder to rent to.",3
"It will push more families away from authorities and immigration control, making enforcement harder, not easier The one part of the Bill from which something useful might actually emerge is the first few clauses of part 1, and the provisions for a Director of Labour Market Enforcement, which we welcome.",3
"It is sad that its presence in an immigration Bill suggests that the new role might be seen as one primarily concerned with enforcing immigration laws, so we have joined our Labour colleagues in supporting amendment 18, which is designed to ensure that the functions of the director are exercised for the purpose of protecting the victims of labour market exploitation More fundamental is amendment 19, which seeks to remove the offence of illegal working.",3
"We share the widespread concerns that, like other offences, it will have little effect in terms of immigration control, but will have other significant adverse effects.",3
"In this case, the negative consequence is to undermine the decent work that the Government have been doing to tackle slavery and trafficking.",3
On that day there were strong speeches on all sides of the House as it united to tell the Government that immigration detention without a fixed and certain time limit was no longer acceptable.,3
"We on the SNP Benches would prefer that we move straight to a position where immigration bail is granted after 28 days, as set out in amendment 32.",3
"It provides clarity and it avoids any misconception or temptation about this role, which is being introduced in an immigration Bill—namely, that it should be about labour market enforcement, not immigration control.",3
The experience of other countries suggests that this is the right focus for this important role Amendment 19 would omit the proposed illegal working offence and maintain the status quo.,3
"The Migration Advisory Committee reported in 2014 that “the combination of non-compliance and insufficient enforcement can lead to instances of severe exploitation, particularly of vulnerable groups such as migrants.” The Committee said in the same report: “We were struck on our visits around the country by the amount of concern that was expressed by virtually everyone we spoke to about the exploitation of migrants in low-skilled jobs.” There is a great deal of other evidence to the same effect.",3
There are already criminal provisions relating to those who have breached immigration rules and there is no need to introduce a new criminal offence for employees.,3
"My current intention is to push amendment 19 to a vote, although obviously I will listen to what the Minister has to say I turn to amendment 20, which also relates to the offence of illegal working.",3
It is a strict or stark offence: an employee who simply does not have the right immigration status commits an offence and has no defence at all.,3
"If an employee in good faith relies on his or her employer to sponsor him or her, but something wrong in the process means that as a matter of law, and unbeknown to them, they do not have the right immigration status, they automatically commit an offence and have no “reasonable excuse” defence.",3
"This Bill, in 2015, proposes to extend the civil penalty scheme by introducing a criminal penalty before there has been a full and meaningful evaluation As was mentioned on Second Reading, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants carried out an evaluation showing, alarmingly, that 42% of landlords said that the right to rent provisions made them less likely to consider accommodating someone who did not have a British passport.",3
"In this country in the 21st century no group of individuals should—for whatever reason, and whether renting lawfully or not—be subject to summary eviction proceedings that, as I said, we turned our back on a long time ago I move on to immigration detention, which has already been touched on and is a matter of increasing concern to many in this House and beyond.",3
"The fact of immigration detention causes real distress and anxiety, particularly among vulnerable groups, and its indefinite nature adds to that.",2
I think I am right in saying that the UK is the only country in Europe that does not have a time limit of any sort on immigration detention.,4
That has been the subject of inquiry by the all-party groups on refugees and on migration.,3
The issue is one of increasing concern and justifying indefinite immigration detention is increasingly difficult.,2
"We must consider how we want to achieve what we are all saying about the principles that have been outlined Work on immigration is taking place, and Stephen Shaw’s review into the conditions of detention is important.",3
"I welcome indications that a further comprehensive review will go to the heart of new clause 13, and particularly recommendations (b) to (e) There is a danger that immigration detention will not get sufficient attention.",3
"Over the year about 30,000 people are held in 11 immigration removal centres, and apart from campaigns and individual circumstances that sometimes lead to litigation, the issue does not get the attention that it needs.",3
"We need serious action one way or another to ensure that immigration detainees are much clearer about when they are likely to be released and have a clear expectation I am a criminal defence solicitor, and as I said in a debate scheduled by the Backbench Business Committee, the first question asked by every client once they have ended up in prison, and after they have challenged me about how I dealt with their case, is, “How long have I got?",3
"What is the earliest date of release?” We must be able to provide greater clarity and at least some expectation that various gatekeepers and review mechanisms have been put in place to ensure that everyone knows that there is no prospect of indefinite detention, and that there is a greater push and pull to ensure that the smallest number of people are detained for as limited a time as possible The new clauses are framed around the inquiry of the all-party group on refugees, which was able to report before the election, and then more substantively in a motion discussed in a Backbench Business debate.",3
Friend the Member for Bedford—recognises the issue of foreign national offenders and public protection.,3
"A quarter of immigration detainees are foreign national offenders in one form or another, so it is not good enough to rely on the issues of public protection alone.",3
"New clause 8 seeks to exempt pregnant women, and people who have been granted asylum as victims of trafficking, torture or sexual violence, from detention orders.",3
"Current Home Office guidance identifies vulnerable groups of people—the elderly, pregnant women, those suffering from serious mental illness, torture survivors, those with serious disabilities and victims of human trafficking.",3
"Under the screening process, those protections are limited, and it is all too commonplace for victims of torture and trafficking to end up in detention centres for an intolerable time.",3
"Despite saying that she had been a victim of trafficking, her detention continued and she was told that she had fabricated her trafficking experiences.",3
"Since her release, she has received formal recognition as a victim of human trafficking.",3
"There must be fair play and they must be treated properly I sense that in the future we will look back at the numbers detained in so-called immigration removal centres—that is a bit of a misnomer—and wonder how we tolerated for so long so many people being detained who were victims of torture, trafficking, sexual violence or who were pregnant New clause 13 has received the most cross-party support because its provisions are very moderate.",3
"The Home Affairs Committee will also be listening to what the Minister says and I hope that we will have an update on the comprehensive review before we go too far down the line in the other place I hope that the Bill will mean that we have many fewer people in immigration detention, many fewer in detention for too long and many more people receiving fair play and respect for their human dignity.",3
"New clause 1—Extended criteria for refugees joining refugee sponsors— ‘(1) Rules made by the Secretary of State under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971, shall make provision for persons outside the United Kingdom to apply for family reunion with persons recognised as refugees in the United Kingdom, or granted humanitarian protection in the United Kingdom on or after 30 August 2005, who are their children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, spouses, civil or unmarried partners or siblings (2) Rules made under subsection (1) may— (a) make provision for dependants of the persons therein mentioned; (b) make provision for a person who the Secretary of State is satisfied was a dependant of the refugee or person granted humanitarian protection or a member of their household at the time the refugee or person granted humanitarian protection left the country of his habitual residence; (c) restrict provision for siblings applying to join family in the UK to those who have not formed their own independent family unit outside of the UK (3) Family members seeking leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom must— (a) be applicants who would not be excluded from protection by virtue of article 1F of the United Nations Convention and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees if he were to seek asylum in his own right; (b) be applicants who would not be excluded from humanitarian protection for any reason in the immigration rules in the United Kingdom.’ This new clause would allow those separated from their family, and who have refugee or humanitarian protection status in the UK, to sponsor family members beyond spouses or under-18 children to join them.",3
It would also remedy an anomaly that prevents children with refugee status in the UK from sponsoring their parents to join them.,3
New clause 11—Review of rules relating to refugee family reunion— ‘(1) The Secretary of State must undertake a review of the current rules on refugees or those granted humanitarian protection reuniting with close family members in the UK.,3

Government amendments 13 to17 New clause 2—Automatic deportation under the UK Borders Act 2007— ‘(1) Section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007 is amended as follows (2) In subsection (2) substitute “12” for “6”.’ This new clause would require that non-British citizens who commit offences and are sentenced to 6 months in prison are deported automatically.,3
"New clause 10—Offence of presence in the United Kingdom without legal authority— ‘(1) Any person who is present in the United Kingdom after 1 June 2016 without legal authority shall be guilty of an offence (2) Any person who after 1 June 2016 enters or attempts to enter the United Kingdom without legal authority shall be guilty of an offence (3) A person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) is liable on summary conviction— (a) to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months; (b) to a fine which in Scotland or Northern Ireland may not exceed £5,000, or to both (4) Any person who is convicted of an offence under subsection (1) shall be subject to a deportation order unless the Secretary of State deems such a deportation order to be against public interest (5) For the purposes of subsection (2) above, a deportation order shall be deemed to be in the public interest unless a certificate to the contrary has been submitted by the Secretary of State to the court.’ This new clause makes provision for criminal sanctions including deportation orders against those who have entered the United Kingdom illegally or who remain in the United Kingdom without legal authority.",3
"New clause 12—Right of residence: registration certificates— ‘(1) Section 7 of the Immigration Act 1988 is repealed (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of the European Communities Act 1972, or any other enactment, any non-UK citizen resident in the United Kingdom without authority to remain in the United Kingdom provided by a valid visa, visa waiver, residence permit or other official permission must apply for a registration certificate to confirm their right of residence in the United Kingdom.",3

"Amendment 38, page 102, line 9, leave out sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) and insert— ‘(1) The Secretary of State must provide, or arrange for the provision of, facilities for the accommodation of persons released on immigration bail.’ This amendment makes provision for an impecunious detainee to be furnished with an address to facilitate their applying for bail, without which they are unlikely to be granted bail.",3
"That support is potentially still available as we continue, as part of this process, to assist families in their entirety, with the appropriate safeguards, in seeing that they are returned if they do not have the right to remain in the UK The appeal statistics on asylum support do not give the full picture.",3
"In the year to August 2015, 37% of asylum support appeals were dismissed.",3
"The previous independent chief inspector of borders and immigration found in his July 2014 report on asylum support that 89% of refusals were reasonably based on the evidence available at the time Amendments 42 to 45 would reverse the Bill’s reforms of support for adult migrant care leavers and require that they be provided with local authority support under leaving care legislation, even though all their applications and appeals to stay here have been refused.",3
"Public money should not be used to support illegal migrants, including failed asylum seekers, who can leave the UK and should do so.",3
"The amendments would create obvious incentives for more unaccompanied children to come to the UK to make an unfounded asylum claim, often by using dangerous travel routes controlled by smugglers and traffickers.",3
"If their asylum claim has been finally refused, automatic access to further support from the local authority should cease at that point.",3
"The Bill makes appropriate provision for their support before they leave the UK Amendment 2 would allow permission to work where an asylum claim has been outstanding after only six months, remove the caveat that any delay must not be of the asylum seeker’s own making, and lift all restrictions on the employment available.",3
We met our public commitments to decide all straightforward asylum claims lodged before April 2014 by 31 March 2015 and to decide all straightforward claims lodged from 1 April 2014 within six months.,3
"If an asylum claim remains undecided after 12 months, for reasons outside the person’s control, they can apply for permission to work in employment on the shortage occupation list.",3
"Work is being done across Government on the return of foreign national offenders, which I know was a particular issue for my hon.",3
"I am not sure that legislation is the right way to approach that The Immigration Act 2014 limits the factors that draw illegal migrants to the UK and introduces tough domestic reforms to ensure that our controls on access to benefits and services, including the NHS and social housing, are among the tightest in Europe.",3
"That would undermine the impact of the minimum income threshold, which the courts have agreed correctly reflects the public interest in controlling immigration to safeguard the UK’s economic wellbeing by preventing family migrants from becoming a burden on the taxpayer and by promoting their integration.",3
A minimum income threshold set at that level would therefore not be sufficient to prevent burdens on the taxpayer once the migrant partner reached settlement and had full access to welfare benefits.,3
It would also provide less support for the migrant partner’s integration in society.,3
That is simply not an adequate basis for sustainable family migration and integration.,2
That is why we introduced the immigration and health surcharge in the last Parliament Amendment 39 seeks to restrict the power of immigration officers to examine someone in-country.,3
"and learned friend the Solicitor General—he is sitting alongside me—said in Committee, the power to examine someone in-country is essential, for example when immigration officers are questioning persons who have been seen climbing out of lorries on motorways or at service stations, and who are therefore suspected of having entered the UK illegally Officers working in immigration enforcement do not conduct speculative spot checks.",3
"To examine a person after the point of entry, an immigration officer must have information that causes them to question whether someone has the right to be in the UK, as set out in the 1987 case of Singh v. Hammond.",3
"Our published guidance reflects that judgment, and makes clear that when conducting an in-country examination, immigration officers must first have reasonable suspicion that a person is an immigration offender, and they must be able to justify that reasoning.",3
"Section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 allows human rights claims and deportation cases to be certified to require an appeal to be brought from outside the UK, where to do so would not cause serious irreversible harm or otherwise breach human rights.",3
"Extending such a power to all human rights claims is a Government manifesto commitment and builds on the success of section 94B, which was introduced by the Immigration Act 2014 and has resulted in more than 230 foreign national offenders being deported before their appeal The Court of Appeal recently considered two cases concerning the operation of that power.",3
"I wish to speak to new clauses 1 and 11, which focus on the response that we should have to the refugee crisis and the way in which the family reunion rules for refugees are simply not working.",3
The background to this is that the European refugee crisis is showing no signs of easing.,2
Nearly 1 million refugees have travelled to our continent this year.,3
"Some 700,000 people have travelled through Greece and, in the final weeks of November, almost 3,000 people were arriving on the tiny island of Lesbos by boat each day—this is even in the November cold.",3
"A huge number of refugees are stuck in the Balkans, often in very difficult and increasingly harsh weather conditions; there are refugees camps in Idomeni, on the Greek border, and thousands more refugees are in Serbia, including unaccompanied children.",3
"Other countries in Europe are doing considerably more than us, and I continually urge the Government to do more, as we need to do our bit to support the refugees.",3
"That will be a powerful point for him to make, but what follows from that is the fact that we should not stand back and allow other countries to shoulder so much more of the burden of responding to the refugee crisis, especially as we are not doing enough to help This year, Britain will take just 1,000 refugees from Syria, and yet 3,000 arrive each day in Lesbos.",3
I was struck by what the Minister said about asylum shopping.,3
"Given that we had only 25,000 asylum seekers in Britain last year, compared with 700,000 in Germany, how can he seriously talk about asylum shopping?",3
"In fact, what we are talking about are families who have been split up by a terrible refugee crisis and who simply want to be together.",3
Parents have been torn apart from their children and brothers apart from their sisters I have met Syrian children on their own in refugee camps.,3
Our current rules make it very hard to reunite families of refugees who have been split up by the crisis.,3
"The British Red Cross is currently supporting an Iraqi refugee who hopes to be reunited with his wife and two daughters, one of whom is disabled and has the mental age of a seven-year-old.",3
"She is entirely dependent on her mother, but she is over 18 and so is not eligible to come to the UK under the Minister’s family reunion rules for refugees.",4
"She is stuck in Iraq, and the strain of being a sole carer is taking its toll on her mother Another case of the Red Cross is that of a 15-year-old boy whose parents have both been killed in the war and whose brother has been granted refugee status in the UK.",3
"He has not registered an asylum claim anywhere in Europe, but has had his fingerprints taken in Greece.",4
"His brother is incredibly worried about his safety, as he feels that he is at risk of being exploited by gangs of traffickers, which, as we know, is what happens to many unaccompanied refugee children When I was in Calais a few weeks ago, I met a single mother with two small children.",3
"Clearly, there is a huge problem here, and it could be what is driving some of the illegal migration.",2
"Many of them told me that it was because they had family in Britain, and they were people who ought to have refugee status.",4
"It is just not working in practice for too many of the refugees who are fleeing terrible conflict When many refugee families have been hit by crisis, persecution or war, they may lose their closest family members.",2
That is why it is so important to look at the wider family relationships of refugees My intention in drawing up new clause 1 was to make it easier to reunite refugee families and to help refugees whose closest family are already refugees here in Britain to get sanctuary here too.,3
It is not my objective to rewrite the wider immigration rules for those who are not refugees; that is a different debate.,3
I want to concentrate on those who are refugees.,3
I recognise that new clause 1 is not the simplest way to do this because it is primary legislation when the matter would be dealt with better through immigration rules.,3
Further changes to immigration rules would be needed alongside new clause 1 to ensure that the measure was focused on those fleeing conflict rather than wider family who are not refugees The new clause is an attempt to focus the Minister’s attention on the plight of families who are being separated all across Europe and need to be reunited.,3
"We should, out of compassion and as part of our support for refugees and for families and the family values that we hold dear, make more attempt to reunite families.",3
It would be the best way for us to increase the number of refugees that we in Britain take.,3
"The refugee crisis is not going away, and the most sensible, simple and fair way to provide more support for those who already have family here who could support them is for us in Britain to give them sanctuary We cannot make the debate on Syria simply one about security.",3
It has to be about refugees and compassion as well.,3
"I know that the Government have done much to help refugees in the region, and I have praised them for doing so many times, but it is not an alternative to doing our bit to reunite families.",3
I urge the Minister in the same spirit to look carefully at what more he is able to do to help reunite some of the desperate refugee families who really need our help.,3
"This is scraping the barrel of immigration control measures, and I will want to test the House’s opinion on that We regard as utterly unnecessary the part 7 provisions on the English language.",3
Part 7 creates unnecessary bureaucracy and is a clear example of immigration theatre and tokenism A number of other Members have made brave attempts to bring a silver lining to the cloud provided by this grim Bill.,3
New clauses 11 and 1 seek to expand the range of people qualifying for refugee family reunion.,3
"In the face of the most dreadful refugee crisis since the second world war, surely this is a sensible option that we can all support.",3
"This is the logical place for them because they have family support here and so will have help with accommodation and integration, for example.",4
Amendment 2 would introduce permission to work for those seeking asylum who have been waiting six months for a decision.,3
"We also thoroughly welcome new clause 14 as a step forward in overcoming the unduly onerous financial thresholds attached to family visas, which the Children’s Commissioner for England recently reported had created thousands of what she called “Skype families”—British children able to communicate with a parent only over the internet.",3
"We are focusing our efforts on humanitarian aid to help the majority of refugees who remain in the region, and working with international partners to find a solution to the conflict, as well as—of course—the issue of resettlement, including of 20,000 of the most vulnerable refugees over the course of this Parliament The right hon.",3
"Those in Calais are the responsibility of the French authorities, and anyone wishing to benefit from the family unity provision of the regulation must first lodge an asylum claim in France and provide details of their family in the UK.",3
"As part of our joint declaration with the French Government, we continue to work with the French authorities on the overall processing of asylum claims and ways in which we can continue to support their activities.",3
"Where a family reunion application fails under the immigration rules, such as in the case of an 18 or 19-year-old applying to join their refugee parents in the UK, the entry clearance officer must consider whether there are exceptional circumstances or compassionate reasons to justify granting a visa outside the rules.",3
Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) highlighted deportation.,3
"Our primary sanctions for immigration non-compliance are removal and civil penalties, which is why, in many respects, prosecution numbers are relatively low.",3
"As we come to Third Reading, it is important that we remember why the Bill is so necessary, so I want to reflect on what we believe the Bill will do As I said on Second Reading, we must continue to build an immigration system that is fair to British citizens and people who come here legitimately to play by the rules and contribute to our society.",3
"That means ensuring that immigration is balanced and sustainable and that net migration can be managed I am sure that the whole House will agree that, without immigration, this country would not be the thriving multiracial, multifaith democracy that it is today.",3
"So since 2010 the Government have reformed the chaotic and uncontrolled immigration system that we inherited, and instead we are building one that works in the national interest This Bill will ensure that we can go further in bringing clarity, fairness and integrity to the immigration system.",3
"This Bill will create a new statutory director of labour market enforcement to oversee and co-ordinate the drive for more effective enforcement across the spectrum of non-compliance The House will appreciate that illegal working remains one of the principal pull factors for people coming to live in the UK illegally, so we are taking the necessary step of making illegal working a criminal offence.",3
This addresses a genuine gap in our ability to use proceeds of crime powers to seize and confiscate the profits made by those who choose to break our immigration laws.,3
"But we should be clear that this measure is not intended to—nor will it—punish the vulnerable, such as those who are trafficked here and forced to work illegally.",3
"Instead, we want to deal with those illegal migrants who choose to work here illegally when they should, and could, leave the UK.",2
But we must also target the employers who facilitate illegal working.,2
The Bill will allow us to strengthen sanctions for employers who knowingly turn a blind eye to the fact that they are employing illegal workers We also know that a great deal of illegal working happens in licensed sectors.,3
The Bill will ensure that those working illegally or employing illegal workers cannot obtain licences to sell alcohol or run late night take-away premises.,3
"Similarly, we will be requiring licensing authorities to check the immigration status of taxi or private hire vehicle drivers.",3
"The message is simple—illegal working is wrong, and it will not be tolerated Too often, illegal migrants ignore the law, remain illegally in this country and take advantage of our very generous public services.",2
We will make it easier for landlords to evict illegal migrants while also introducing new offences for rogue landlords who repeatedly rent to illegal migrants.,3
"We will crack down on those driving while in the UK illegally by ensuring that, if they hold UK driving licences, their licences can be seized and taken out of circulation.",3
"We will also strengthen the consequences for those continuing to drive without lawful immigration status, including powers to detain their vehicle We will create a duty on banks and building societies periodically to check the immigration status of existing current account holders so that accounts held by illegal migrants can be closed or frozen following a court order It is right that we address the appeals issue so that we can remove people with no right to be in the UK.",3
"In 2014 we introduced our deport now, appeal later scheme, which has helped us to deport over 230 foreign national offenders.",3
"The Bill allows us to do just that, to ensure that illegal migrants who have not been offered leave to remain cannot frustrate the removal process.",3
We will also ensure as a result of the Bill that when foreign criminals are released on bail we can place a satellite tag on them so that we know their whereabouts and can improve public protection The Government are clear that we have a duty to offer support to those who come to the UK and seek our protection while their claim is being assessed.,3
"Such individuals are illegal migrants, and to support them further would be unfair on those who do need our protection and our support to establish a new life here.",2
The Bill redresses that balance and removes incentives to remain here illegally Two other aspects are important.,3
Controlling our borders is vital in protecting national security.,2
"The Bill gives Border Force officers more powers to intercept vessels at sea, increase penalties for airline and port operators who fail to present passengers to immigration control, and automatically apply UN or EU travel bans to stop dangerous individuals coming to the UK Secondly, in line with our manifesto, we will ensure that customer-facing public sector workers are able to speak English.",3
"Where communicating with the British public is a vital part of the job, fluent English should be a prerequisite, and through this Bill we will legislate to ensure that this becomes a reality When the Government first came to power in 2010, the immigration system that we inherited was chaotic and uncontrolled.",3
"We have tightened immigration routes where abuse was rife, shut down more than 920 bogus colleges, capped the number of non-EEA migrant workers admitted to the UK, reformed family visas, and protected our public services from abuse.",3
"This Bill will build on our achievements and ensure that we have an immigration system that is firm and effective, fair on the British public and on those who come here legitimately, and, most importantly, serves the national interest.",3
"The Statement is as follows “Mr Speaker, before making a Statement on counterterrorism, let me update the House about what we are doing to help address the migration crisis in Europe and, in particular, to help the thousands of refugees who are fleeing from Syria.",3
Some are economic migrants in search of a better life in Europe; many are refugees fleeing conflict.,3
"The majority of these are Syrian refugees fleeing the terror of Assad and ISIL, which has seen more than 11 million people driven from their homes The whole country has been deeply moved by the heart-breaking images we have seen over the past few days.",3
"It is absolutely right that Britain should fulfil its moral responsibility to help those refugees, just as we have done proudly throughout our history.",4
"That means helping to stabilise countries where the refugees are coming from, seeking a solution to the crisis in Syria, pushing for the formation of a new unity government in Libya, busting the criminal gangs that are profiting from this human tragedy and playing our part in saving lives in the Mediterranean, where our Royal Navy has now rescued over 6,700 people.",3
"The rest will go to neighbouring countries—Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon—where Syrian refugees now account for one quarter of the population.",3
"We will invest even more in tackling the causes of the crisis in the Middle East and north Africa and we will hold much larger sums in reserve to respond to acute humanitarian crises as they happen Turning to the question of refugees, Britain already works with the UN to deliver resettlement programmes and we will accept thousands more under these existing schemes.",3
"We have already provided sanctuary to more than 5,000 Syrians in Britain and have introduced a specific resettlement scheme, alongside those we already have, to help those Syrian refugees particularly at risk.",3
"So we are proposing that Britain should resettle up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over the rest of this Parliament.",3
"However, because we are not part of the EU’s borderless Schengen agreement or its relocation initiative, Britain is able to decide its own approach.",3
"So we will continue our approach of taking refugees from the camps and from elsewhere in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.",3
"This provides refugees with a more direct, safer route to the United Kingdom, rather than risking the hazardous journey to Europe which has, tragically, cost so many lives.",3
We will continue to use the established UNHCR process for identifying and resettling refugees and when they arrive here we will grant them a five-year humanitarian protection visa.,3
Over recent days we have seen councils and our devolved Administrations coming forward to express their willingness to do more to take Syrian refugees.,3
My right honourable friends the Home Secretary and the Communities Secretary will now work intensively with local authorities and the devolved Administrations to put in place the necessary arrangements to house and support the refugees that we resettle.,3
"The Home Secretary will update the House on these plans next week Finally for this part of the Statement, in full accordance with internationally agreed rules we will also ensure that the full cost of supporting thousands of Syrian refugees in the UK will be met through our aid spending for the first year, easing the burden on local communities.",3
"This will be a truly national effort, and I know the whole House will come together in supporting these refugees in their hour of need Turning to our national security, I would like to update the House on action taken this summer to protect our country from a terrorist attack.",3
"Our approach includes acting overseas to tackle the threat at source, with British aircraft delivering nearly 300 air strikes over Iraq, and our airborne intelligence and surveillance assets assisting our coalition partners with their operations over Syria As part of this counterterrorism strategy, as I have said before, if there is a direct threat to British people and we are able to stop it by taking immediate action, as Prime Minister I will always be prepared to take that action.",3
"I know that James Brokenshire says that it is not indefinite because we have to comply with the European convention, but it feels indefinite if you cannot see the end, coupled with uncertainty about the outcome The evidence is that compliance rates from community-based arrangements for looking after asylum seekers are very high, and of course that is a much less expensive way of going about the work.",3
"The Home Office has put so much effort and thought into the issue of slavery and trafficking over the last few months, and into the operation of the national referral mechanism.",3
There must be a read-across from that to the trauma suffered by many who find themselves in asylum and immigration detention because of their experiences.,3
"It may not be due to trafficking, but, my goodness, it amounts to a huge degree of trauma, and they are in danger of retraumatisation by the experience of detention Immigration detention gives a wrong message to those who seek sanctuary and support—I accept that that is not the only population of IRCs—and sends a message about them.",3
"I go so far as to say that I think that it gives support—which I know is unintended—to that nasty, xenophobic element of society that sees immigrants in a way that I know your Lordships do not.",3
"Noble Lords on the noble Baroness’s Benches who voted against the amendment on overseas domestic workers, which was taken to a Division last night by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, should hang their heads in shame.",3
"We have made a very principled decision on what we as a Labour Government would do on asylum detention As the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, said, the guidelines on torture and pregnancy are not being enforced, so the immigration laws have to be changed, and then we have to ensure that they are enforced We have looked at indefinite detention in further detail.",3
"For those asylum seekers who have suffered abuse, torture or sexual abuse, it must be such an ordeal and deeply distressing.",2
"I confirm to your Lordships’ House that a Labour Government would end indefinite detention for people in the asylum and immigration system We are not setting a timescale today, but in government we will consult on the appropriate time limits to detention, and look at appropriate safeguards for detention decisions, at best international practice and at existing alternatives that are being used and, in many cases, working well.",3
"An important part of our commitment is that we would also recruit 1,000 additional border and immigration enforcement staff to help speed up that decision-making process, indentify breaches of the Immigration Rules and enforce and manage removals.",3
"If they have no right to be in the UK, they still must be treated fairly and appropriately I want to be clear that we are not talking about those who have committed criminal offences or are being deported because of criminal behaviour, or about those who pose a threat to our national security or public safety.",4
"This change will affect the rules around detention for people in the asylum or immigration system I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, for allowing us to have this debate.",3
"We need to make sure that those issues are looked at carefully I join the noble and learned Lord in paying tribute to the authors, Sarah Teather and the others mentioned in this debate, for the way that they conducted both part 1 and part 2 of their review of detention in the immigration system and its effectiveness.",3
"When I visited Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre, there were different categories of people whom I met.",3
"They are then brought into the detention centre and stay only for a matter of hours before they are moved on and processed elsewhere, often returning of their own choice to France or Belgium There are then the most difficult cases, the foreign national offenders who have been referred to in many of the contributions that I have listened to.",3
These are the people who used to be held within the prison estate and were then deported from there when they had served their sentence.,3
A small proportion of them are still in the prison estate but are held now in the immigration detention centre ready to be removed.,3
The noble Lord rightly spoke of the appropriateness of mixing foreign national offenders who are on their way out with people who are seeking asylum in this country.,3
"A principal reason why people are held there is that it is not in their interest to co-operate and give an accurate name, to give their passport details and date of birth, and to get replacement documentation for their country, because that would be, as it were, to co-operate in the process of the return which they do not want—they want to stay here.",4
Virtually every foreign national offender whose case I have looked into has been there for a very long period and falls into that category The detained fast track is an issue which will have to be addressed.,3
"Normally, the Border Force feels that these people’s asylum claims at ports of entry can be dealt with quickly and a swift decision reached.",3
Not all those people are then deported; many of those claims are immediately upheld and the individuals concerned are moved to be cared for in the asylum system.,3
"Taking advantage of the leniency which my noble friend Lord Hurd gave me, I can say that that will now be released I can also say as a statement of intent that we do not, as a direction of travel, want to see growth in the numbers of people in the immigration detention centres.",3
"Moreover, today we are announcing that we are handing the Haslar immigration removal centre back to the prison estate.",3
"When we talk about that, distinct from talking about foreign national offenders who I think we all recognise are a different category in this sensitive issue, we are talking about those in the detained fast track.",3
"Last Thursday evening, Border Force officers at the port of Harwich detected and intercepted 68 migrants seeking to enter the UK illegally and clandestinely.",3
Among the 68 migrants were two pregnant women and 15 children.,3
Seven migrants complained of chest pains and nausea and were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure.,3
All four drivers of the lorries involved were arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration.,3
"Some of the individuals have claimed asylum, and UK Visas and Immigration is considering their claims, including suitability for the “detained fast track” process.",3
Two of the asylum seekers are unaccompanied minors and have been placed in the care of Essex social services.,3
"We have already begun the work to seek the removal of the remaining migrants from the UK, and 15 have already been successfully removed.",3
"If we can show that those claiming asylum have also claimed in another EU member state, we will seek to remove them under the Dublin regulations.",3
"The Government are clear that the EU’s approach to migratory flows must include the proper management of the external border, the prompt return of those not in genuine need of protection and action to tackle the efforts of the smugglers and traffickers who profit from human misery I am aware that my hon.",3
"Among other successful operations in recent years, the team has made some significant seizures, including 15 kg of heroin in December, 17 kg of cocaine in May and 2.9 million cigarettes in March On the specific problems of clandestine immigrants, Border Force concentrates significant resources at the juxtaposed ports in northern France, where the vast majority of illegal border crossings are attempted.",3
"Border Force can and does move its resources around on the basis of threat to ensure we keep one step ahead of the criminal gangs that exploit vulnerable people and try to circumvent our immigration laws The important work that Border Force officers carry out, detecting and intercepting those who attempt to enter the UK illegally, in conjunction with law enforcement agencies in the UK and internationally, is vital in the fight against organised criminal networks engaged in people smuggling.",3
"I commend Border Force for its discovery last week and the work it does day in, day out to protect the UK’s border, and I commend this statement to the House.",3
"Seeking out illegal entrants is not its first priority, which is to swipe passports of known passengers and carry out anti-terrorist measures Secondly, although Border Force was able to reassure me that it has effective working relationships with its counterparts in Holland and elsewhere across the continent, the UK does not have an agreement with Holland on what is known as—the Minister referred to it—juxtaposed controls, similar to those with France, which enable the UK authorities to operate on the ground at Calais and other French channel ports.",3
"Yes, we found these individuals, and I am delighted that the Minister has been able to tell us that 15 of these clandestine migrants have already been deported, but out of the 68, what is the likelihood that many will end up achieving what they wanted and be allowed to stay here?",3
Why do clandestines cross continents of free countries to claim asylum here?,4
"While we must honour our obligations under the tightly defined criteria for asylum claims laid down in the 1951 Geneva convention, how much does the way that we adjudicate on the much wider provisions of the European convention on human rights unreasonably inflate asylum claims so that the UK attracts people to claim asylum here rather than elsewhere, and what should be done about that?",3
"It is quite clear that human traffickers are evil, brutal gangs, but one problem that we came across when I was chairman of the all-party group on human trafficking was that illegal immigrants were coming through the porous eastern borders of the European Union and travelling across the EU unchallenged, partly because of freedom of movement and partly because there are no border checks.",3
"The amendment would iron out what seems to be a contradiction about the position as between a letter from the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Bates, in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, which came from the Home Office Your Lordships will recall that this Bill extends provisions regarding any tenant’s right to rent, but those who are caught up in this situation are, not entirely, but very often, immigrants.",3
"The point, as she summarised it, is that asylum speakers whose presence is not illegal but who do not have documentary proof are unable to show landlords that they have a right to rent.",3
"He wrote: “It remains the case that migrants who do not understand whether they may qualify for permission to rent may contact the Home Office to establish whether this is the case” That was welcome, but earlier in the same month the Home Office, replying to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, said three times: “there is no application route for permission to rent” It also said: “It is not a question of a migrant making an application for permission to rent, but rather a status the Secretary of State may consider affording on a case by case basis” To explain the problem a little further, Home Office guidance envisages that permission to rent will be granted in cases such as: asylum seekers; refused asylum seekers; families co-operating with the Home Office’s family return processes; individuals on criminal or immigration bail; those within the Home Office voluntary departure process; victims of trafficking or slavery; and individuals with an outstanding out-of-time immigration application, in-country appeal or judicial review.",3
"However, he also made it clear that the Government did not consider it appropriate for there to be an absolute rule and gave the example of an irregular migrant—I deliberately do not repeat the term “illegal”, in line with the recent recommendation of the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights—who arrives at an airport and can be returned almost immediately.",3
"He spoke of detention’s “undoubted damage to mothers and unborn babies” at a meeting in Parliament hosted by Caroline Spelman MP, who together with me, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham—who I do not believe is in his place—were members of the parliamentary inquiry into detention which recommended that pregnant women should never be detained for immigration purposes.",3
"Of the 99 pregnant women detained in Yarl’s Wood during 2014, 30—that is nearly one-third—were held for between one and three months; four for three to six months; and only nine were deported from the UK.",3
The fact that nine out of 10 pregnant women held in detention in 2014 were subsequently released back into the community rather than deported suggests that it is rare.,3
"ILPA makes the point that if a pregnant woman claims asylum she cannot be returned until her claim is determined in any case As Women for Refugee Women argue, refusing to accept Shaw’s clear recommendation of an absolute exclusion from detention on the basis of what would appear to be a small number of cases each year where swift removal might be possible, and when there is clear evidence that allowing decision-makers discretion results in significant numbers of pregnant women being detained in circumstances that are far from exceptional—just one pregnant women being detained when she should not be is one too many—is not sensible, effective or humane policy-making.",3
"Furthermore, exempting from detention an individual who has arrived at the border with no right to enter the United Kingdom and who can be put on a return flight quickly would allow pregnant women access to the United Kingdom regardless of their immigration status The noble Baroness, Lady Lister, mentioned that 99 pregnant women were detained in Yarl’s Wood in 2014 and that this number had reduced to 69 in 2015.",3
She is a foreign national offender who recently completed an 18-month prison sentence and was detained there on 9 February.,3
A deportation order was signed and removal directions were in place for 3 April.,3
These were later brought forward to 26 March but then deferred because of an asylum claim being made.,3
This is what frequently happens in these circumstances and goes some way to explain why only a small proportion of those actually in detention are subsequently removed from detention and deported.,3
Many are released under condition and their asylum or immigration status is determined subsequently and the matter disposed of in that way I stress that we are dealing with cases in which there are exceptional circumstances.,3
"The noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, observed that uncertainty over immigration status could itself be a source of stress and anxiety for a pregnant woman.",3
"The committee also stated that only a compulsory card, or one that carried details of immigration status, would have an impact on preventing illegal immigration.",3
The rollout of compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals began in November 2008 and the rollout of the identity card to UK residents began on a voluntary basis in November 2009.,3
"The then Government argued that the Act would achieve less illegal migration and illegal working, enhance the UK’s capability to counter terrorism and serious and organised crime, reduce identity fraud and lead to more efficient and effective delivery of public services.",3
"However, as has been said, the UK Border Agency continues to issue biometric residence permits to non-European Economic Area foreign nationals staying in the UK for more than six months to provide evidence of the holder’s immigration status in this country In his speech, my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours made his case for identity cards in his typically powerful and persuasive manner, and raised a number of points which require a full answer from the Government if this debate is to have any meaningful purpose and not simply turn out to be little better than a talking shop.",3
"On previous, very recent occasions when the issue of identity cards has been raised, both in this House and in the other place, the Government’s response has been that they considered money that would have been spent on identity cards had been and was being more usefully spent on better equipping security forces and better securing our borders There are two points on that.",3
"First, to suggest that we have improved and are improving control of our borders by using money not being spent on identity cards seems a rather doubtful claim from a Government who are nowhere near achieving their own declared objective of net migration in the tens of thousands, who apparently have large numbers of asylum seekers whose claims they have rejected still in this country without even knowing where they are, and who have no real idea how many people are in this country with no authority to be here The second point is that the Government appear to see identity cards as an inferior option to investing in other means of improving security and control rather than as potentially another complementary string to the bow.",3
"As a result, the extent to which it can be claimed that an identity card system and an identity register represent some further unacceptable intrusion into privacy is one on which there are likely to be very different views In the House of Commons earlier this week, the Government were asked by both a Conservative and a Labour Member to reconsider the question of ID cards in the light of issues concerning immigration and the identification, detention and deportation of illegal immigrants, as well as the introduction of digital services, national security and the protection of UK citizens from terrorism.",3
"In his speech, my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours laid emphasis on how he considered the benefits of identity assurance went way beyond those areas and into addressing the increasingly worrying area of identity fraud I have to say that this is a Government who are prone, on occasions, to making hasty decisions on security and border control issues.",3
"Instead, the case that my noble friend has made today deserves to be considered carefully in the light of the current situation—particularly in respect of increasing identity fraud, the need for identity assurance, the threat of terrorist activity and apparent levels of illegal immigration—and given an evidence-based response, irrespective of whether the Government decide they are going to change their approach or not I hope that that is what the Government’s line will be today: that, without any commitment to change their current stance, they will nevertheless set up a review of the advantages or otherwise of the introduction of an ID system giving identity insurance, including looking at the position in other countries that have such systems and the benefits or otherwise that those systems actually bring—an issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Scriven In today’s environment, all measures that might further enhance security and address other significant problems and issues, including identity fraud, merit careful and full consideration of their advantages and disadvantages so that decisions made on what measures it is in the interest of our nation and our citizens to adopt are clearly evidence-based.",3
They thought that all that would survive was the assembly of foreign-designed vehicles as a stepping stone to Europe.,3
"We need a level playing field for domestic steelmakers against overseas competition, including competitive energy, labour and tax policies—mainly infrastructure.",3
"Most of all, we need to develop a mindset of competitiveness, to which the Government should always respond That is especially true of immigration policy.",3
"Considering the key people who work in those companies, I would suggest that a lot of them are top-quality immigrants.",3
"I was surprised when I saw the figure—it is estimated that 34,000 people a day become displaced, including asylum seekers and refugees, and people internally displaced.",3
"The British Red Cross study highlights how far the international community has yet to go in ensuring that all migrants, regardless of their legal status, receive the protection and support they need It is a vast issue, with 65 million refugees and 65 million individual stories.",3
What pressures led them to risk crossing devouring seas in very fragile boats?,3
"This past year, more than 3,000 have drowned as they tried to cross from north Africa to the European continent One Syrian refugee who fled civil war and left all that he knew and loved behind had studied English and history at his university in Syria.",3
"He travelled by rubber dinghy and in the back of lorries, in constant fear for his life because he was in the hands of traffickers The family of another young man from Syria sold everything they owned to help pay traffickers and get him to safety.",3
"He, and 45 other people, were put in an inflatable boat that was intended for a maximum of 20 people, he walked 12 hours in the dead of night once he reached Greece and spent the month after that walking through Macedonia and Serbia Those who have fled Syria are the victims of circumstances.",3
In no way can they be regarded as economic migrants.,2
We hear of government attempts to reduce the number of asylum seekers to tens of thousands.,3
"In 2015, the courts overturned Home Office decisions in 38% of asylum appeals.",3
"In 2015 alone, nearly 15,000 asylum seekers were locked up in detention centres.",3
"In fact, nearly half of all asylum seekers will be detained during their asylum process here in Britain.",3
What led me to support the coalition Government in the previous Parliament was the pledge to end child detention in immigration cases.,3
Britain is not fit for purpose in its processing of asylum applications.,3
The United Kingdom currently welcomes less than 1% of the world’s refugees.,4
"Canada welcomes 25,000 Syrian refugees a month.",3
"The obligation in the latest Immigration Act to accept unaccompanied child refugees is not making a great of deal of headway In 2016, the United Nations made its strongest appeal for humanitarian aid, calling for $20.1 billion.",3
"This September, President Obama will host a leaders’ summit on refugees to increase financing for international humanitarian organisations by 30%, double the number of legally resettled refugees, increase access to legal channels of admission and increase the number of refugee children in schools and refugee adults in work.",3
We have to accept our fair share of refugees here in the UK.,4
"In the UK, with 20,000 refugees to accept before the next general election takes place, according to the Prime Minister’s pledge—there is no use passing this on to the next Prime Minister as the pledge has already been made—unaccompanied refugee children must be accepted here.",3
"As other noble Lords have mentioned, more than 65 million people are forcibly displaced worldwide, a third of whom are refugees.",3
"We are committed to increasing assistance to meet the needs of refugees, displaced people and host communities, and to encouraging international financial institutions and bilateral donors to bolster their assistance Also mentioned was the first ever World Humanitarian Summit held in May, which was attended by 55 leaders.",3
"The G20 summit will immediately precede the two summits which the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, highlighted in his title to the debate: the UNGA high-level event on large movements of migrants and refugees, hosted by the UN Secretary-General, and the US summit on refugees to be hosted by President Obama The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, mentioned migration and the UN summit.",3
It will seek to agree a new global compact for refugees and lay the groundwork for a global framework for dealing with irregular migration.,3
The compact will reinforce the 1951 convention and the 1967 protocol and have a focus on responsibility-sharing for refugees.,3
The United Kingdom aims to secure these principles as a key part of the declaration and refugee compact agreed at the United Nations summit.,3
"The noble Lord, Lord Collins, went on to ask another question to which I will respond in writing, and I will provide answers in the Library for all those who have taken part in the debate As noble Lords are aware, the following day, on 20 September, President Obama will host a leaders’ refugee summit aimed at making new and significant commitments to strengthen the international response to the global refugee crisis.",3
"This includes securing increased funding to humanitarian organisations and UN appeals, doubling the number of resettlement places, and providing opportunities for education and legal employment to increase refugees’ self-reliance and inclusion.",3
"While the management of migrants in Calais is the responsibility of the French Government, the United Kingdom recognises that vulnerable people in the camps are at risk from exploitation and trafficking.",3
The United Kingdom will contribute £17 million to joint work with France to ease migrant pressures in the Calais region and further strengthen the UK border The United Kingdom and France run regular joint communication campaigns which inform individuals of their rights to claim asylum in France and give them information on family reunification.,3
"The Syrian crisis is the most pressing humanitarian challenge facing us at this time, and the Government are to be commended on co-hosting an important conference that has raised more than $10 billion for Syrian refugees.",3
The wholly commendable efforts on Syrian refugees in the region belie the Government’s wilful myopia on the plight of more than half a million Syrian refugees here in Europe.,3
"It is true that the majority of Syrian refugees are in the region, and the situation continues to worsen.",2
"We all saw the television pictures at the weekend of tens of thousands of terrified Syrians waiting at the border with Turkey in response to Assad’s bombardment of Aleppo, but will the Secretary of State explain how much longer this country and the EU can expect Turkey to keep its border with Syrian open while at the same time we want to prevent refugees from transiting to western Europe The funds raised by the conference are vital, but it is vital, too, that this country shows willingness to take its fair share of refugees, including Syrian refugees.",3
"The UK has agreed to take, over five years, fewer refugees than Germany has taken in a month.",3
"The Opposition appreciate that this country has not signed up to Schengen, but does the Secretary of State acknowledge that the fact that we are not signatories to Schengen does not remove the moral responsibility that falls on us as part of the European family of nations, and does she accept that many people are surprised and disappointed that the Government have rejected the Save the Children campaign to take in just 3,000 child refugees The Secretary of State may well wish that these children had stayed in the region, but the direction in which the children chose to flee does not make them any less vulnerable.",3
"These children may not be in the part of the world she might prefer them to be in, but they are still lone children at risk of abuse, sex-trafficking and worse.",2
"She cannot behave as if there are two classes of Syrian child refugee: one set who stay in the region, whom she is prepared to help, but another class who have travelled to Europe on whom she turns her back The Secretary of State will have heard reports of the German Chancellor’s speech in Turkey today.",3
Does she agree with Angela Merkel that the ultimate solution to the migrant crisis is safe and legal pathways for refugees?,3
"We entirely agree that it is unacceptable and illegal to use siege, starvation and the blockage of humanitarian aid as a weapon of war.",3
Friend the Leader of the Opposition has called for some time All Syrian refugees want to return home.,3
"Immigrants and refugees, whether they go home or not, never lose that hope in their heart that they will return to the country in which they were born.",3
"But whether the Secretary of State would prefer it or not, there are half a million Syrian refugees here in western Europe.",3
"Friend the Leader of the Opposition, I visited the camp in Calais and met very many Syrian refugees there, many of whom, it seemed to us, had a legal right to come to this country, and all of whom were living in appalling conditions When the caravan of these international events has moved on, there will still be thousands of Syrians and other refugees, including an increasing proportion of women and children, living in appalling conditions in Europe, frightened, terrorised and at the mercy of people traffickers.",3
"We may all wish that they had not listened to the people traffickers, but this Government should be doing more not just for Syrian refugees in the region, but for the very many Syrian refugees here in western Europe.",3
I wanted to use that example because I did not want to get into the arguments about immigration and migration control.,3
"The problem of forged passports is important I do not accept what the Home Office used to say, which is that if we create a safe environment for people who have been trafficked, it will be a pull factor.",3
People can come in and claim asylum anyway.,2
"On human trafficking, it was absolutely not like that.",3
"We finished up with a Modern Slavery Act 2015, which increased the penalties for trafficking, toughened border control and improved the rights of victims to prove that they were victims, which is a complicated thing, but we did not deal with the situation of child victims.",3
"I will develop the argument a little later Adult victims of human trafficking are a central Government responsibility, that of the Ministry of Justice.",3
"Unbelievably, children who are victims of human trafficking finish up in local authority homes and, bizarrely, are indirectly the responsibility of the Department for Education.",3
"The biggest single fear, I gather, is immigration or migration.",2
This seems to worry people more than it worries me because we have been a nation that built ourselves on immigrants and things worldwide.,2
"As I mentioned, the fear of the nation is migration or immigration.",2
"I live in the very happy hope that having been here for 52 years I may have a few years longer However, there needs to be some decision-making as to where, who and how we develop overseas countries to our own benefit.",3
It is amazing that having been such a great steel country we should rely on individual foreigners to save our manufacturing of iron and steel.,2
This report is a welcome and valuable contribution to the debate on the future of EU foreign and security policy.,3
"The foreign policy challenges in the near neighbourhood pose even greater threats to the EU’s security and prosperity than was the case just 10 years ago Given these serious threats, we believe that a properly coherent approach to EU external action has never been more important.",3
"The EU’s collective action is relevant to many of the UK’s foreign policy objectives, and as a large member state with global interests and membership of many key international organisations and groupings, the UK is in a strong position to influence EU common action.",4
"The paper entitled The European Union in a Changing Global Environment, published by High Representative Mogherini last June, set the context for a revised Europe Global Strategy and described the challenges that EU foreign policy needs to address.",3
"We have been working closely with the strategy team in Brussels to feed in our views An important comparative advantage for the EU in foreign policy, set out a moment ago by the noble Lord, Lord Collins, is the EU’s ability to combine with its diplomatic and security tools a wide range of policy instruments: political, economic, development, and humanitarian—he is right.",3
We think the EU needs to improve further its ability to combine its foreign policy instruments—and its institutions—more effectively.,3
"In particular, we encourage stronger links between the Council-led foreign policy work and the Commission-run trade and energy work, where interests and objectives can sometimes overlap.",3
We absolutely agree that member states drive the whole issue of EU foreign policy—it is a national competence.,3
We support the committee’s call for the EU to use the strategy review as an opportunity to set rigorous priorities and improve the execution of its foreign policy decisions We also agree that the new strategy should aim to achieve better co-operation between the EU and NATO.,3
"For the first time, we have a plan that breaks the business model of the people smugglers by breaking the link between getting in a boat and getting settlement in Europe I turn briefly to the Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy, to which several noble Lords referred.",3
"The EU remains united in its commitment to the interests of our eastern partners Many noble Lords—my noble friends Lord Horam and Lord Balfe, the noble Lords, Lord Anderson, Lord Judd and Lord Soley, and the noble Earl, Lord Oxford and Asquith, to take just a few—referred to Russian foreign policy.",3
"Concern about the direction of Russian foreign policy has generated useful debate in this House, not just today but on previous occasions when we have had the chance to go into more detail.",3
"We have taken a unified approach and shown Russia that its illegal actions in the way it has behaved in Ukraine will not be tolerated, including by taking the step of sanctioning a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council Several noble Lords referred to the fact that it is important to think about the Russian Government and not lump in the Russian people with them.",3
They have long-standing success and reputations overseas.,3
"They market themselves individually overseas; the GREAT campaign, which succeeded in other areas of the economy, has really not made as much progress in knowledge, to my mind, as it should have However, it is the Home Office we have in front of us today, so most of my speech will concentrate on what I think it could do to improve things.",3
"This is not true, particularly with Brexit: we are all in this together, we all have responsibility, particularly for immigration, since controlling immigration is clearly one of our objectives, post-Brexit All of us—the Government, employers, universities and individuals—have a shared responsibility, over time, to do something about the level of immigration.",3
There is a very interesting pilot going on with Imperial College and some other universities to see what can be done to improve things further in return for privileges in the way that overseas students are dealt with.,3
"We have to wait, quite reasonably, for the Home Office to develop immigration policy generally.",3
"The post-study work route, which matters a lot when it comes to marketing university courses overseas, is fundamentally subservient to our overall, detailed immigration objectives.",3
It has a lot of attractions as a method of immigration.,3
"Once we have that policy I very much hope that post-study work visas will re-emerge as a very good way of bringing in whatever it is we want by way of immigration There is scope for a much more open, much deeper relationship between the Home Office and universities.",3
It really does not seem to be integrated with the systems that the Home Office has.,3
"There does not appear to be any positive approach to the idea of students coming here at 14 or 16 and our taking them through to the end of a degree in a UK university, which is a growing part of the market There are lots of areas where there is scope for collaboration and continuous improvement in the way that the Home Office and universities work together to make us a better destination for overseas students.",3
"The idea of discrimination on quality, that there are courses so bad that they are fit only for putting our own children into debt, is not something that appeals to me or has any resonance overseas.",3
"I do not want to see, and I am sure that my noble friend does not want to see, the University of Huddersfield struck off the list as not being grand enough for overseas students.",3
"If overseas people want to study at our further education colleges—there are some wonderful, world-leading courses—or even if they just want to come here to study English, why should we put them off if we are in proper control of the consequences of our immigration policies That comes back to the old problem of the treatment of students as immigrants.",2
"Clearly, a group of people to whom that applies are not immigrants in the way that we usually think of them; nor do people around the country think of them as immigrants in the usual way.",3
"Their inclusion in the figures means that every time we do something to try to control immigration, which we will be doing pretty frequently, that is read overseas as an attack on overseas students We are completely muddying the waters.",3
It would be much better for everybody if the figures were separated and we could have a clear view of what is happening in the areas of immigration that we all care about The Home Office has demonstrated a great ability to be destructive to the reputation of higher education abroad.,3
"I shall comment from the perspective of colleges, and indeed schools, in the independent sector, where large numbers of overseas students have been educated with skill and success for many years I declare my interest as president of the Independent Schools Association, the ISA, one of a number of bodies that comprise the Independent Schools Council, of which I am a former general secretary.",3
"The ISA works on behalf of some 400 schools, generally small in size, committed to keeping their fees as low as possible and to increasing means-tested bursaries, and fully integrated with their local communities.",3
"The colleges mingle great talents and different cultures, enriching our own country and other nations It will perhaps come as little surprise to your Lordships that in these schools and colleges there is unanimous opposition to the inclusion of overseas students in the official immigration figures.",3
Suffice it to say that the current arrangements impede recruitment and damage the reputation of our country as a place that is both open and welcoming to overseas students It ought surely to be a fundamental objective of any Government to assist the continuing success of our country’s private education sector in recruiting overseas.,3
"Its schools and colleges are world leaders, earning significant foreign exchange and promoting British cultural and democratic values worldwide.",3
"But with the reverberations of Brexit stirring concern about our country’s future across the globe, Britain’s independent schools and colleges are increasingly conscious of the difficulties that they face because of our current stringent immigration study requirements.",3
"This was brought home to a CIFE college principal on a recent visit to Nigeria: Canada, he was told, was now seen as more attractive than the UK Serious concern has arisen in particular because the processes through which overseas students have to pass have become increasingly onerous and, in their application, a source of increasing anxiety to schools and colleges because stiff penalties are now being imposed, often in a seemingly arbitrary fashion, for minor paperwork errors.",3
"That can threaten the very existence of schools and colleges with a significant proportion of overseas students A litany of complaints from schools and colleges about decisions by UKVI, many of them apparently arbitrary in character, has reached the ISA’s chief executive, my colleague Mr Neil Roskilly.",3
"The introduction of yet more regulations, particularly those which require students to apply for visas more frequently, is compounding the problem.",3
Encouraging and welcoming foreign students to the UK is one of the most effective ways of garnering and sustaining that soft power.,4
So much for evidence-based policies The Government also seem to ignore the evidence from a poll carried out by Universities UK that the majority of people do not view international students as immigrants—clear evidence that a more restrictive policy is unlikely to assuage public concerns on migration.,3
"As with our main competitors in the international education sphere, Canada, Australia and the US, students should be classified as temporary rather than permanent migrants and should not be subject to a target.",3
"My noble friend called them “visitors”, and I think that that is quite right One of the key recommendations in the excellent IPPR report, Destination Education: Reforming Migration Policy on International Students to Grow the UK’s Vital Education Exports, was that, like Australia, the UK should set out a 10-year plan for expanding its education sector as part of its industrial strategy and that, as part of that plan, the Government should reintroduce the post-study work visa for STEM and nursing graduates.",3
"With the future of EU student recruitment at UK universities uncertain, and with UCAS figures showing a 9% decrease in applications so far this year, how will the Government communicate that all students from outside the UK are still welcome here It is clear that the policies of fear rather than pragmatism are driving immigration policy, which is having many perverse and adverse effects, especially on our higher and further education sector.",3
"We say that we are proud to be an outward-looking, open and welcoming country, but the policies pursued in relation to overseas students and immigration tell a different story.",3
I hope that they do so and that they not only rethink their new proposals but take the bold decision to remove from the immigration target the international students who are welcomed by the vast majority of our fellow citizens.,3
"Having served there for nine years, I know well the importance of foreign students at so many of the leading universities in this country, perhaps particularly in London.",3
"The problem, of course, is that students are included in the immigration statistics.",3
"Those who voted for Brexit and those who are concerned about immigration do not, on the whole, consider students to be immigrants, and even if they do, they are not particularly concerned about student immigrants.",3
"Like other noble Lords, I urge the Minister, whom I much admire, to try to persuade the Home Secretary to take students out of the immigration figures If the Government really do want to get immigration down to below 100,000, that will be completely impossible if students continue to be counted.",3
I have heard the Government’s response that it is not possible to take students out of the immigration figures because all countries are required to use the United Nations definition of an immigrant: a person who comes to a country with the intention of staying for more than 12 months.,3
"It produces two sets of figures: one based on the United Nations definition and one prepared by the Department of Homeland Security, which makes the distinction between permanent and temporary immigrants.",3
The numbers are now starting to fall and this is mainly because of visa and immigration problems.,3
My main concern is that there have been a number of intimations from government that overseas students are not welcome in the United Kingdom.,4
"Far from discouraging students, we should be encouraging overseas students.",2
"Tens of thousands of students from India and China want to come here but we are losing market share because it is more difficult to get a visa to come here than, for instance, to the United States We all know that in the past, student visas were granted for study at educational establishments that were not approved colleges or universities.",2
"Clearly, there must be a rigorous standard set for students to come here, and only students coming to study at recognised institutions should be given a visa.",3
"But we are competing with other countries to attract the best students and it should be no more difficult to come here than it is to go to the United States, Canada or Australia, to take three examples In conclusion, it is clear that noble Lords in all parts of this House are asking the Home Secretary and her Ministers to re-evaluate the immigration policy as it pertains to students.",3
"The Prime Minister has long opposed taking them out of the immigration numbers, as we have heard in this debate, although only a quarter of the public think that they should be regarded as immigrants.",3
"The world sees a country that has voted for Brexit, where there have been troubling instances of immigrants being hassled in the streets and now sees a country that is adding a thickening bureaucracy, which makes applying for student visas more problematical and which is toying with adding new barriers.",3
"Is this really, as they say, to improve quality or is it just a cheap and easy way to cut the number of immigrants There is another obstacle.",3
"I cannot help noticing that I get pleas from time to time from young ensembles that find their lead violinist or cellist is being denied a visa and so their career and planned engagements are being cut short To sum up, if we put off overseas students, my establishment, Trinity Laban, will suffer.",3
"Yet, as we have heard from all sides, the Government insist on counting them as immigrants, while at the same time declaring that immigration must be reduced to meet a target that has little regard to the needs of the country Reference has been made to the recent polling carried out by Universities UK which found that the majority of people do not see international students as immigrants.",3
"We could spread the field wider to see just how influential the UK may have been in days gone by Why can we not follow the example of more welcoming countries by designating students as temporary migrants or visitors, thus removing them from the stigma of being part of immigration totals?",3
There appears to be a fear somewhere that vast hordes of students will stay on illegally after their studies and cause havoc and unrest in society.,2
"This makes it impossible for the thousands of students studying sub-degree programmes to progress on to higher education, thus making our provision less attractive to ambitious international students We heard from many noble Lords, my noble friend Lady Smith among them, about the complexity of the visa system.",3
"Tier 4 visas provided opportunities for graduates to work in the UK for two years after they had completed their courses, but that is now reduced to four months.",3
"So how will the Government try to ensure global opportunities for UK students in future in order to guarantee that UK graduates have the international skills necessary to compete, which they can more readily acquire while working alongside overseas students, and in order to avoid the cultural chauvinism mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey The Minister has heard overwhelming, if not absolutely unanimous, support in this House for a change of policy towards overseas students.",3
I urge her to use her good offices with the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary to persuade them to take one very simple step: to remove students from the immigration figures.,3
We will all benefit from hearing more from her This Motion is most timely and enables us to further understand the position of the Government; it gives noble Lords an opportunity to offer some advice to the Government on the application of immigration policy and how that applies to overseas students.,3
"My first point, which has already been referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Trees, and others, is that polling has consistently shown that the British public see international students not as long-term migrants but as valuable temporary visitors.",3
"International students arrive in the UK and complete their studies, and then the majority go home afterwards A ComRes poll referred to by other noble Lords revealed that only a quarter of British adults think that international students are immigrants.",3
"In many ways, it is a win-win for the UK for the universities, the local economy and the students themselves The Government have ambitious targets to grow the number of overseas students, and I welcome that.",3
"On the one hand, the Government say that they want to increase the number of international students and that they are very welcome here; on the other, their actions give a very different impression to prospective students, with tighter controls and the UK appearing unwelcoming and unfriendly to international students The insistence on keeping student numbers as part of the policy target on immigration has been discussed many times in your Lordships’ House and elsewhere, but the Government are just not listening.",3
A set of statistics using the same UN definition is produced but the Department of Homeland Security also produces a second set which makes a distinction between permanent migrants and those classed as non-migrant admissions.,3
"I know the east midlands very well—I worked there for many years—and I wholeheartedly endorse her comments about the university nexus in Nottingham, Derby, Loughborough and Leicester The noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Newnham, commented how difficult it is for international students to get a visa to undertake a course at Cambridge University, one of the finest institutions in the whole world.",3
"Like me, she is an immigrant, and also like me, she sounded quite emotional speaking in this House for the first time.",3
"We do not propose to cap or limit the number of overseas students who can come to study in the UK Our approach is based on two key principles, which I hope will be shared by all noble Lords.",3
"I do not want to bring politics into what has been a bipartisan debate, with very good contributions from all around the House, but I have to say that the student immigration system the Government inherited in 2010 was a mess.",3
"Some 920 institutions have had their right to sponsor overseas students removed, and the effects are clear to see.",3
"The proportion of overseas students now attending higher education institutions has risen by 16%—from 143,000 in 2010 to 166,000 in 2015 I would not want your Lordships to interpret this as an attempt to restrict those who are genuine in their desire to study.",3
"The grant rate for tier 4 general visa applications has increased every year since 2010, and 94% of such applications were granted in 2015 Of course, applications from some nationalities are down, as the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, pointed out.",3
"There are natural fluctuations, but the fact that overall applications to universities have increased in the last five years is encouraging and suggests that any particular falls should not be attributed to Home Office immigration policies This Government are determined to help our best institutions attract the best international talent from around the world.",3
We recently launched the tier 4 visa pilot.,3
"Four institutions, the Universities of Bath, Cambridge, Oxford and Imperial College, chosen because of their consistently low visa refusal rates, are piloting a scheme whereby certain visa eligibility checks have been delegated to the universities and the documentary requirements for students taking part are reduced.",3
"We have not done so, as it is commercially sensitive information As the Home Secretary recently announced, we will be seeking views on study immigration routes.",3
"He asked why we cannot have two sets of immigration figures, like the USA.",3
"International students who stay for longer than 12 months have, like other migrants, an impact on the infrastructure and services that they use and the communities in which they live.",3
"The House of Commons Library estimates that 4.9 million UK citizens live or work in other countries, yet in my surgeries, week in, week out, I meet constituents from overseas who cannot obtain visas, residency or citizenship here.",3
The whole of Scotland is outraged at the threat of deportation facing the Brain family.,3
"What, in the Chancellor’s view, is the difference between an economic migrant and an expat?",3
"It is important for all migrants of all backgrounds, race, creed and religion to learn English, for themselves and for society as a whole.",3
"There were 850,000 people in the last census who said that they spoke little or no English” Yet the Prime Minister chose to single out Muslims with a figure of 190,000, which many question In addition, the Government cut £40 million last year from funding for migrants wanting to learn English.",3
"The Woolf Institute, which had a recent commission on religion in public life, said: “It is extremely unfortunate that the prime minister has chosen to focus solely on Muslim women to make an important point about the integration of immigrants” It has asked that this issue be looked at in the round and said that points that apply to, “immigrants from a wide variety of nationalities … and religions … have been used to associate all Muslims with difficulties associated with integration” I agree with my own party leader, Tim Farron, when he says: “Linking women in the Muslim community who struggle with the English language to home grown extremism only serves to isolate the very people Cameron says he is trying to help” Threats of deportation are even more unhelpful Where is this policy framed in a way that will attract and positively encourage more women—and men—from all backgrounds to integrate properly, learn the language and become active members of our society?",3
"The scale of the migration challenge requires NATO, the European Union and other countries across Europe to work together to address both its symptoms—the constant flow of migrants and the conditions we see them face—and the causes in Syria and beyond.",2
"We must also work with local civilian authorities to tackle the gangs that profit from smuggling migrants The United Kingdom has already been engaged for several months, with the Home Office ship VOS Grace deployed in the region since November with a detachment of Border Force officers On 11 February, NATO Defence Ministers took the decision to deploy NATO ships, better to enable Turkish and Greek coastguards to intercept the migrant boats and disrupt the smugglers’ business model.",3
"Standing NATO maritime group 2 arrived in the region within 48 hours of that decision and has been conducting initial reconnaissance and surveillance of illegal crossings since then The NATO Secretary-General outlined in a statement yesterday evening that discussions between NATO, Turkey and Greece have agreed that NATO vessels can now operate in Greek and Turkish territorial waters We have, therefore, decided that the UK contribution is to send Royal Fleet Auxiliary Mounts Bay and a maritime Wildcat helicopter to the Aegean.",3
"They will work alongside three Border Force boats: the VOS Grace, the cutter Protector, which is on its way to the region, and a further cutter, which is expected to start operations later this month.",3
"In the meantime, the Royal Navy deployment is an important part of the international effort to assist the Turkish and Greek authorities in reducing this criminal and dangerous people trafficking.",3
"In those parts that affect Scotland, the Government must do all they can to provide assurances and clarity Specifically, concerns have been raised about the immigration powers in the Bill.",3
"Article 33 of the refugee convention states: “No Contracting State shall expel or return…a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened” That fundamental duty is one of the central pillars, if not the central pillar, of the refugee convention and the Government are bound by that duty as a matter of domestic and international law.",4
The charity Liberty is worried that that purports to give the Secretary of State powers to refoule refugees on any such boats by returning them to foreign ports Nothing in the proposals requires the Secretary of State or her enforcement officers to use those powers in a way that is compatible with the refugee convention and the work of the European Court of Human Rights.,3
They must lawfully process and assess those people’s claims to asylum and determine whether they can be lawfully removed according to the Dublin regime.,3
Nor can the Government use their enforcement powers to identify alleged breaches of the UK’s immigration law to impose penalties or bar refugees from making asylum claims on that basis.,3
I therefore ask the Minister to say unambiguously today that he intends to comply with the refugee convention and the European Court of Human Rights.,3
"On that note, the provision in the Bill on fees could potentially extend the executive competence of Scottish Ministers and would therefore require a legislative consent motion Giving police the power to require arrested persons to state their nationality, applying to arrests for all offences, seems to go beyond the purpose of immigration.",3
"Our foreign policy rests on the pillars of democratic values, the rules-based international system and human rights.",3
"We are now getting the figures on a weekly basis from the police—we did not used to, but it is important that we do, because these spikes do occur, sometimes predictably at certain events, but sometimes from something that is completely left field within our own country or indeed overseas.",3
"Like other noble Lords, although I have faith, I recognise that the role of humanists in this country is most often to promote tolerance and integration, and I applaud that.",3
"The overwhelming majority of Muslims, as with other faiths living in Britain, are law-abiding, peaceful and an accepted part of our country Britain has a proud tradition of religious tolerance within the law, and the Government are committed to creating a strong and integrated society in which hatred and prejudice are not tolerated and in which all people are free to express their identity and live without fear of harassment and crime that targets them because of their identity.",4
"All of them are playing great roles in interfaith, and that has to be something that we encourage as a country; indeed, we encourage it in the department Given the limit of time today, it will not be possible for me to respond to all the contributions that we have heard today, but I will ensure that I write to Members, copying it to everyone who has participated in the debate, to pick up specific policies and points that were made on national citizenship, the prison system, housing, family law, bank holidays, corporate social responsibility, mental health, corporate pay, disability, art and sports funding and the visit to Hull.",3
"I have already mentioned the point about humanists, but I want to echo it again: they too have a role to play in integration.",3
"In Bradford, I saw the Bangla Bantams, people descended from Bangladeshi immigrants, working successfully with Bradford City Football Club to break down barriers and encourage local Britons descended from South Asians to attend local football matches In October, I had the opportunity to speak at the launch of a schools linking programme.",3
"A point well made earlier was that the Government can put up housing but cannot create communities The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, made a valuable point: all of us are ultimately descended from immigrant stock.",3
"But we have also seen huge growth in the number of people coming to southern Europe from Afghanistan, Pakistan and north Africa, all facilitated by the rapid growth of criminal networks of people-smugglers.",3
"More than 8,000 migrants are still arriving in Greece every week and there are signs that the numbers using the central Mediterranean route are on the rise again.",3
"So far 10,000 have come this year Of course, because of our special status in the European Union, Britain is not part of the Schengen open border arrangements—and we are not going to be joining.",3
"We have our own border controls and they apply to everyone trying to enter our country, including EU citizens.",4
But it is in our national interest to help our European partners to deal effectively with this enormous and destabilising challenge We have argued for a consistent and clear approach right from the start: ending the conflict in Syria; supporting the refugees in the region; securing European borders; taking refugees directly from the camps and neighbouring countries but not from Europe; and cracking down on people-smuggling gangs.,3
"This approach of focusing on the problem upstream has now been universally accepted in Europe, and at this Council it was taken forward with a comprehensive plan for the first time As part of this plan, the Council agreed to stop migrants leaving Turkey in the first place; to intercept those who do leave while they are at sea, turning back their boats; and to return to Turkey those who make it to Greece.",3
For the first time we have a plan that breaks the business model of the people-smugglers by breaking the link between getting in a boat and getting settlement in Europe I want to be clear about what Britain is doing—and what we are not doing—as a result of this plan.,3
British asylum experts and interpreters are already working in Greece to help to process individual cases.,3
"Our share of the additional money, which will go to helping refugees in Turkey under this agreement, will come from our existing aid budget But let me also be clear what we are not doing.",3
"First, we are not giving visa-free access to Turks coming to the UK.",4
"Schengen countries are planning to give visa-free access to Turks but, because we are not part of Schengen, we are not bound by their decision.",4
"We have made our own decision, which is to maintain our own borders, and we will not be giving that visa-free access Secondly, visa-free access to Schengen countries will not mean a backdoor route to Britain.",4
"As the House knows, visa-free access means only the right to visit.",3
"Just because, for instance, British citizens can enjoy visa-free travel for holidays in America, that does not mean that they can work, let alone settle, there.",4
"Nor will this give Turkish citizens those rights in the EU Thirdly, we will not be taking more refugees as a result of this deal.",3
"We said that we would resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees over this Parliament, taking them directly from the camps, and that is what we are doing.",3
"The second was to have a voluntary resettlement scheme for 22,500 from outside the EU, but by the end of last year just 483 refugees had been resettled throughout the 27 countries We said what we would do and we are doing it.",3
"We are fulfilling our moral responsibility as a nation Turning to the central Mediterranean, the EU naval operation that we established last summer has had some success, with more than 90 vessels destroyed and more than 50 smugglers arrested.",3
"HMS “Enterprise” is taking part and we will continue her deployment throughout the summer What is desperately needed is a Government in Libya with whom we can work, so that we can co-operate with the Libyan coastguard, in Libyan waters, to turn back the boats and stop the smugglers there, too.",3
The United Kingdom should be leading by example in the response to the refugee crisis.,4
"Credit where credit is due: where this Government have played a leading role, such as in encouraging humanitarian relief in Syria and the region, we have been successful, not least at the Syria donor conference in London last month However, when we look at the agreement and the Statement from the Prime Minister, we find it shameful that the United Kingdom is demonstrating such reluctance to stand up for vulnerable refugees who have fled from war and terror.",3
"Our continued inaction does not do justice to Britain’s history and values When one reads the Prime Minister’s Statement, one finds that we will not be taking more refugees as a result of this deal.",3
"The vast majority of refugees fleeing Syria and Iraq choose to stay in the region, as close to their homes as possible, but for those who cannot survive in the region, routes must be available to apply for asylum not only in the United Kingdom but in other countries as well.",4
"In the vote in the earlier Division, the House made its view very clear on that On previous occasions the noble Baroness the Leader of the House and other Ministers have tried to argue that, by accepting those seeking asylum who have travelled the fraught journey to continental Europe, we are only encouraging more people to do so.",3
"If, as the Statement hopes, the agreement breaks the business model of the people smugglers, what reason is there then for us not taking an equitable share of those who are already in continental Europe Clearly, the Dublin system is not currently sufficient to deal with this crisis.",3
"Instead, the United Kingdom should encourage the European Union to develop European-wide systems of responsibility for asylum seekers, including setting up a system for asylum requests to be distributed equitably across EU member states which takes account of different demographic projections, such as the high net migration in the United Kingdom, compared to forecast population decreases elsewhere Turning to the specifics, many people and well-recognised organisations have expressed concern that the proposals as they stand seek to address only the short-term concerns over European borders.",3
Can she give details of how full and proper asylum determination procedure will be carried out in Greece in full compliance with European Union law?,3
"Will those who have the right to international protection be granted asylum only in Greece, or will they be relocated elsewhere The one-for-one arrangement appears to apply only to Syrian refugees.",3
"Not surprisingly, Greece is having great difficulty processing the number of people through the relocation provisions, so can the noble Baroness give us some detail as to how quickly people will be assessed and indicate what provision the United Kingdom is making for the assessment process There appears to be little in the way of concrete proposals to tackle trafficking within Turkey and other launch points, including Libya.",3
"Although we would like a full investigation into the cash flows of the smuggling businesses, in the mean time, can the noble Baroness assure the House that the money provided by the European Union to improve humanitarian conditions for refugees in Turkey will be closely monitored and, where possible, be funded through international organisations, including UNHCR, UNICEF and other NGOs Finally, the EU-Turkey statement reaffirms a commitment to re-energise the accession process.",3
"For the first time, there is now a serious and comprehensive proposal to deal with this very serious migration and refugee crisis in Europe.",3
"As has been acknowledged, if it is properly implemented, the deal with Turkey will break the business model of those very wicked people, the people smugglers, by breaking the link between getting in one of their boats and getting resettlement in Europe.",3
"This European Union programme for refugees in Turkey is comprehensive, and builds on the bilateral support that the United Kingdom is already providing to the many Syrian refugees in Turkey.",3
"As for the support to those who arrive in Greece and seek refuge and asylum there, the new processing centres or hotspots will include interpreting advice and ensure that they are all treated as individuals, in terms of their cases, as international law requires The noble Baroness asked about Turkish travel documents.",3
"For the one-for-one scheme to apply, when a refugee from Syria is returned to Turkey, another refugee has the opportunity to be settled in Europe.",3
"We have had another passionate debate about refugee family reunion, as we had in Committee and, of course, as we had on the previous group of amendments.",3
It is a central part of the UK’s asylum policy and of our approach to the collective effort needed across Europe and beyond to manage the consequences of the conflict in Syria and elsewhere as well as we can.,3
We recognise that families may be separated due to conflict and persecution and the speed and manner in which asylum seekers often flee their country.,3
"First, our refugee family reunion policy allows immediate family members of those granted protection here, who were part of the family before the sponsor fled their country, to reunite in the UK.",3
"This reflects our obligations, to which the noble Baroness referred, under the refugee convention.",3
"On 28 January, the Government announced that we will work with the UNHCR on a new scheme to resettle unaccompanied children from around Syria and conflict areas where it is in the children’s best interests to do so In addition, British citizens and refugees in the UK can sponsor family members who themselves are recognised refugees under our mandate resettlement scheme.",3
"Under our refugee family reunion policy, we have reunited many refugees with their immediate family and will continue to do so.",3
"We have granted more than 21,000 family reunion visas in the last five years, from 2011 to 2015.",3
That is not a small number and it is likely to increase in line with the numbers of recognised refugees in the UK.,3
"That is an essential but also a responsible and sustainable part of our overall asylum policy and our contribution to supporting those affected by the conflict in Syria and elsewhere Alongside these provisions, the Immigration Rules enable British citizens and persons settled in the UK to sponsor their spouse or partner and children under 18 to join them here, where they make the appropriate entry clearance application and meet the relevant criteria.",4
The family rules also cover those with refugee leave or humanitarian protection status to sponsor a spouse or partner with whom they formed a relationship after they fled their country of origin.,3
"Where an application fails to meet the requirements of the rules, our policy requires consideration of exceptional circumstances or compassionate factors for granting a visa outside the rules.",3
This can include reasons why extended family members should join a refugee here.,3
"There are indications that some EU countries are moving towards more, not less, stringent requirements in this regard, because they understand the impact this is likely to have on where someone chooses to claim asylum The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and others made a powerful case based on compassion.",3
"It is right that such arguments should weigh heavily in this debate, but the Government are charged with the responsibility of maintaining the viability and effectiveness of the UK’s asylum system as a whole.",3
"It is because of that principle that the Dublin regulations make specific provision to unite children who claim asylum in another member state with their parents or other relatives, where they can take care of the child and it is in the child’s best interests to bring them together.",3
"It is clearly in the best interests of asylum seekers, children or adults, to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach so that they can be provided with assistance there and do not seek to travel further across Europe Our policy prevents children with refugee status sponsoring their parents to join them.",3
"As Save the Children points out, many children are feared to have fallen victim to human traffickers and people smugglers.",3
"These criminals will seek to exploit the very compassion that lies behind the proposed amendment, and allowing child refugees to sponsor relatives would play right into the hands of the criminal gangs and undermine the safeguarding responsibilities that we seek to uphold.",3
The UK has fully implemented the Dublin III regulation and we think that the arrangements are the right way to provide consistency of approach across the whole EU in dealing with asylum applications.,3
"If they claim asylum in another EU country and have close family already in the UK, the family reunion provisions of the EU Dublin regulation provide a route for asylum seekers to join them We recognise that some European countries face particular pressures on their asylum and border systems, which is why the UK has been active in providing practical operational support, bilaterally and via the EU and its agencies, to countries such as Greece, Italy and Bulgaria.",4
"This support includes more than 1,000 days of asylum experts deployed as part of the European Asylum Support Office The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked why British citizens cannot sponsor a family member under the family reunion criteria.",3
"Only those with refugee or humanitarian protection status are entitled to sponsor immediate family members under family reunion provisions, which means that they do not need to meet the same financial or language requirements as those applying under the family rules.",4
This policy recognises that refugees may need more time to integrate into society following the grant of refugee status.,3
"Of course, that very much helps them to integrate into the local community and gives them that support network.",3
"Suffice to say that we have on record the very significant financial contribution that we have made and the comparative effectiveness of our resettlement programme in having brought 1,000 people to this country, whereas the European resettlement programme has managed to resettle only half that number among 27 countries in the European Union The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, asked whether there was a managed resettlement system for refugees.",3
Allowing child refugees to sponsor relatives would play right into the hands of the criminal gangs and undermine the safeguarding responsibilities that we are seeking to uphold.,3
"I respect that, but I am afraid that we disagree on it, and I shall try to explain why the Government feel like that The amendment concerns the family Immigration Rules for British citizens which also apply to those who are settled in the UK and those here with refugee leave or humanitarian protection to sponsor a spouse or partner to come and remain in the UK.",3
"However, we believe that family life must not be established here at the taxpayer’s expense and that family migrants must be in a position to integrate into British society.",3
So the effect of the amendment would be to remove the minimum income threshold and accommodation requirements; to remove the requirement for basic English language speaking and listening skills; to remove the suitability requirements which prevent a foreign criminal from qualifying for leave; to remove the minimum age requirement; to remove the requirements which prevent the formation of polygamous households and prevent those with a prohibited degree of relationship from qualifying; and it would run counter to Parliament’s view of what the public interest requires in immigration cases engaging the qualified right to respect for family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights as set out in the Immigration Act 2014.,3
"Understanding basic English and being financially independent, for example, help to ensure that the migrant spouse or partner can integrate and play a full part in British society.",3
"My Lords, the immigration skills charge is a major innovation in UK immigration policy and very difficult to debate this late in the evening.",3
"There is a real problem here of how we address a major innovation which the Royal Society, on behalf of the national academies, says will cost universities £25 million a year merely to deal with short-term secondees from foreign universities working on two-year post-doctoral fellowships in British universities.",3
"We raised a number of questions in our short Committee stage to which Ministers, as I have just said, have not responded The Minister, in responding in Committee, could assure us only that, “details about the rate and scope of the immigration skills charge will be set out in regulations to be laid before the introduction of the charge.",3
The immigration skills charge is to be rushed into effect before the beginning of the next school and university year—I assume deliberately—to catch recruitment from outside the EU of teachers and academics for the 2016-17 year.,3
"If the Minister cannot provide a justification for this rush to implementation, we may wish to return to this question at Third Reading I stand shoulder to shoulder with the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, in accepting that the failure to train sufficient British citizens in skills in demand is one of the most powerful pull factors in UK immigration.",3
"When hospital trusts announce that they need to recruit 15,000 nurses from outside the EU, when head teachers are searching Australia, west Africa and Asia for maths teachers, and when IT companies are forced by shortage of skills within Britain to look for recruits in India, large numbers of additional migrants are pulled into the UK.",3
"I read the Grayling public affairs comment on last Thursday’s Budget, which warned that, “a current lack of policy clarity and consistency … may undermine the government’s target of 3m apprenticeships … With so little information available, employers will rightly be concerned about how the … system will work” Last June, the Prime Minister stated that improvement in training would come first, and then reduction in skilled immigration, but here we are presented with charges to reduce skilled immigration before the training scheme has been set up.",3
"Can he confirm whether the Government see this as a universal charge on all entrants under tier 2 visas or whether exemptions for health and education, for example, are envisaged?",3
"The idea of charging Health Education England for visas for overseas doctors coming here for advanced training, or hospital trusts for recruiting nurses, seems absurd—funding them with one hand and fining them with another There is a large air of unjoined-up government about all this.",3
"It is very clear that whenever decisions are made in the European Union, they come back to and come under the sovereignty of this House On immigration, one of the huge strengths of this country—it has made us one of the strongest, richest, most powerful and greatest countries in the world—has been our ability, over centuries, to absorb and integrate millions of immigrants, migrants, people fleeing oppression and economic migrants.",4
My family were economic refugees who came to this country during the Irish famine in the mid-19th century.,4
This country has got rich and stayed rich on immigration.,2
"It received a full day’s parliamentary debate yesterday and we will have further debates leading up to 23 June The British public made it clear that they were not happy with the status quo, and the Prime Minister sought to address that, so last November he wrote to Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, setting out in detail the four areas in which he sought change to the European Union, namely economic governance, competence, sovereignty and immigration.",3
That means we can create more jobs and security for working people in Britain We said that we would protect Britain as the eurozone continues to integrate.,3
"We have delivered that in this deal, which means that British taxpayers will never be required to bail out the eurozone and that British businesses can never be discriminated against because we are not part of the euro We said that we would put an end to the “something for nothing” welfare culture for EU migrants so that we can control immigration from Europe, and we have delivered on that as well.",3
"EU migrants can no longer claim full in-work benefits for four years, which some people said would be impossible to achieve, and child benefit will no longer be sent overseas to Europe at UK rates.",3
"We have already delivered our commitments to require EU migrants to leave Britain after six months if they have not found work and have no genuine prospect of finding a job, and to stop EU migrants being able to claim universal credit while looking for work.",3
"It means that we will never join the euro, never join a European army and never be part of the Schengen borderless zone Soon the people of Britain will have their say on the UK’s membership of the EU.",3
Their case is yet another that highlights the chaos of the immigration system under this Government.,3
"The Brains’ situation will be familiar to many Members in this House, who will have seen their own constituents faced with deportation owing to changes in the immigration rules.",3
"They entered legally, they have integrated into their community and they have fully embraced its way of life.",3
That they should now be faced with deportation because of Government changes shows the problems caused by the constant chopping and changing of the immigration rules by the Home Office.,3
"Member for Moray (Angus Robertson) correctly said yesterday; the Brains’ case is not an issue of immigration, but of emigration.",3
Our immigration system must allow us the flexibility to meet the needs of our communities.,2
"Of course there must be rules to govern immigration, and it is important that these rules are enforced, but this is also an issue of compassion.",2
"Should we be deporting children whose whole lives have been here, to a country they barely know I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.",3
Why do the Brain family no longer qualify under the original visa terms under which they came to the UK?,3
"Why is the Home Office making this an issue of immigration, as opposed to one of emigration, as under the original scheme?",3
"According to the latest immigration statistics, I am told by the Refugee Council, over 3,600 applications for asylum have been without an initial decision for longer than six months.",3
"As the Refugee Council comments, when you take into account their dependants, that is nearly 5,000 people living on little over £5 a day in asylum support who are unable to work.",3
"In any event, what is to be gained by a restriction that continues up to the 12-month point It seems that a lot is to be lost: contribution to the economy through work and taxation; savings for the state on asylum support; and, as for the individuals, the impact on their self-esteem, mental health, possible—probably likely—loss of skills, and the ability to find employment when the period comes to an end.",3
"For those who stay, their community integration is important and we should not delay it, because more than half of the asylum seekers who come here stay This is a very topical point, as a colleague, Suzanne Fletcher, who was a councillor in the north-east and who is still a very active Liberal Democrat, has been all over the media today on the issue of the red doors, on which the Times has reported—doors that were painted red so that the occupants could easily be identified as immigrants.",3
"If your reasons for coming here are economic rather than to seek asylum, I would have thought that six months would be quite a deterrent in itself Our Amendment 134A deals, as the noble Lord has said, with the 12-month period.",3
"Therefore, asylum seekers would not be likely to get such jobs, because the period of their stay is uncertain, even if they were qualified to do them.",3
"More recently, in 2007—long before I came to this place—the Joint Committee on Human Rights described the denial of the right to work as part of a deliberate policy of destitution, in breach of asylum seekers’ human rights The all-party parliamentary inquiry into asylum support, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Alton—of which I was a member—talked about how asylum seekers who are not able to undertake paid work lose skills and are unable to provide a role model for their children, and about the impact on their self-esteem, self-confidence and mental health.",3
"A Freedom from Torture report on poverty among torture survivors states: “Many questionnaire respondents, and most participants in client focus groups, highlighted the importance to them of having permission to work while their asylum claim is decided as a means of supporting themselves and being self-reliant.",3
"Indeed, the lack of permission to work for asylum seekers was a major theme of discussion and the key change that focus group respondents called for, although they also recognised that many torture survivors”, may not be “well enough to work” A letter to the Independent at the end of last year asked why asylum seekers are not allowed to work in the UK.",3
But these skills are wasted and deteriorate while we wait for a decision on our asylum applications.,3
Why should asylum seekers be denied the opportunity for a whole year of joining the happy ranks of hard-working families in the labour market—and even then joining only on very restrictive terms?,3
The evidence shows that this impedes integration.,3
"The Home Office’s own research shows that delayed entry into the labour market can cause problems even when refugee status is then granted, leading to high levels of unemployment and underemployment We have already heard about what happens in other European countries.",3
"My understanding is that most of these countries have fewer applications for asylum than are received in the UK, which does not support the argument that providing the right to work acts as a pull factor.",3
"Moreover, as Still Human Still Here argues, it is not very likely that economic migrants would draw themselves to the attention of the authorities by making an asylum claim, so that they might be able to apply for permission to work in a whole six months’ time The danger is that asylum seekers will end up in the shadow labour market, facing the kind of exploitation we discussed earlier in the context of undocumented migrants.",3
"Indeed, can the Minister say whether, if they do take paid work, they could be caught by Clause 8 —criminalised for working illegally even though they are legally in the UK awaiting a decision on their asylum claim I fear that Governments are often timid with regard to the rights of asylum seekers, for fear of public opinion.",3
"However, surveys by the IPPR, and the British Social Attitudes survey, show that there is public support for allowing asylum seekers the right to work.",3
"The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, in an inquiry into destitution among asylum seekers a few years ago, said: “Overwhelmingly, giving asylum seekers the right to work was the favoured solution identified”, by those who gave evidence As has been said, we have debated this issue a number of times in your Lordships’ House, even in just the five years that I have been here.",3
"Since the previous time we debated it, the financial position of asylum-seeking families has worsened because of the savage cut in asylum support for children.",3
We will come to employment in a moment It is important that we protect the resident labour market for those lawfully present in the UK and discourage those not in need of protection from claiming asylum for economic reasons.,3
"This approach prioritises access to employment and business opportunities for those lawfully in the UK, including recognised refugees.",3
"It will undermine this approach if non-EEA nationals can bypass employment restrictions by claiming asylum, particularly where that claim is clearly without merit There has been much comment, including tonight from the noble Lords, Lord Alton and Lord Ramsbotham, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about historic delays in decision-making in the Home Office, but this has been brought under control.",3
"The Home Office met its public commitment to decide straightforward asylum claims lodged before April 2014 by 31 March 2015, and to decide all straightforward claims lodged from 1 April 2014 within six months.",3
This means that the vast majority of asylum claims are decided quickly.,3
"While awaiting a decision, asylum seekers are provided with free accommodation and a cash allowance to cover essential living needs—I will come on to the detail of that in response to the noble Lord, Lord Alton—if they would otherwise be destitute.",3
"I am not relying on volunteering as a primary argument, and it will not be financially beneficial, but it will help with integration, making friends, learning the language, maintaining skills and so forth.",4
It also assists genuine refugees.,3
It is common knowledge that some people make unfounded asylum claims.,2
Earlier access to employment risks making asylum more attractive for those who are otherwise not eligible to work in the UK Providing more generous employment opportunities for those who claim asylum therefore creates a risk of more unfounded claims.,3
An increase in the number of such claims would slow down the processing of genuine claims and undermine our progress towards a fair and efficient asylum system.,3
"The noble Baroness, Lady Lister, asked a straightforward question about whether asylum seekers would be caught by Clause 8 and the offence of illegal working.",3
"The right to work is a different question from whether you are in the UK lawfully and it is better if I write to the noble Baroness and send copies to interested Peers to confirm how Clause 8 will affect asylum seekers The noble Baronesses, Lady Lister and Lady Hamwee, talked about other countries that allow asylum seekers to work that had fewer asylum claims and whether reducing the period would act as a pull factor for asylum seekers.",3
"Germany, which was mentioned by the right reverend Prelate, the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, and others, allows asylum seekers to work after three months and the highest number of applicants were registered in Germany in 2015, including thousands of migrants from the western Balkans who are economic migrants and rarely qualify for asylum.",3
"Germany has the highest asylum intake in the EU The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked about the permission to work, which is limited to the shortage occupation list.",3
"It comprises skilled jobs where there is an identified national shortage that it is sensible to fill, at least in part, through immigration.",3
"Under EU law, we are entitled to prioritise access to work for UK and EEA citizens over asylum seekers.",3
"However, those granted refugee status have unrestricted access to the labour market The noble Baroness also mentioned the recent news about red doors.",3
"As the Immigration Minister told the other place today, we have commissioned an urgent review and officials will be travelling to Middlesbrough tomorrow to begin that The noble Lords, Lord Ramsbotham and Lord Alton, talked about the support package that is made available to asylum seekers.",3
"The current level is for each person in the household—the asylum seeker and any dependant—and of course they have access to NHS healthcare and all minor children are legally entitled to free primary and secondary education The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked how many asylum seekers had been awaiting a decision for at least six months.",3
"The British Red Cross has produced a report on the problems of destitution faced by asylum seekers which is based on 56 cases, but for the most part these were not asylum seekers.",3
"Some 46 of the 56 were failed asylum seekers, people the courts agreed did not need our protection As I said at the beginning, this is an emotive issue.",3
"These are all issues that have been identified by those who work in the sector, both the landlords and agents and the various groups which have concerns for immigrants The Home Office evaluation of the West Midlands scheme acknowledges that the sample sizes were small—I would say they were very small—and that the findings are indicative rather than definitive.",3
"In fact, the evidence showed discrimination The aims of the right-to-rent scheme are to reduce the availability of accommodation for people who are illegally in the UK, to discourage those who stay illegally—in other words, to encourage them to leave—by making it more difficult to establish a settled life here and to reinforce action against rogue landlords.",3
I do not believe that the report demonstrates that those aims were met I congratulate the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants on the work it did.,3
"I shall not quote a great deal from its report as I hope that I have made the points fairly succinctly, but it points out from an independent evaluation it commissioned that 42% of landlords said that the right-to-rent requirements have made them less likely to consider someone who does not have a British passport and more than one-quarter said that they would no longer engage with those with foreign accents or names; at Second Reading, I said that I thought that with my slightly odd name I might find it hard to find rented accommodation.",3
I declare an interest as the owner of properties which are let to long-term tenants I find it a bit rich that landlords should risk imprisonment for housing an illegal immigrant when it is the Government’s failure in their duty to protect the borders of this country that has resulted in the illegal immigrant being here in the first place.,4
"I fully understand the difficulties in controlling our borders, which will inevitably lead to errors, but should the person responsible for the error go to prison?",2
"If those responsible for allowing illegal immigration should not go to jail, why should a landlord?",2
"I am afraid that I do not share the optimism of the noble Lord, Lord Best, that the power will not be abused at some stage New Section 33A says that if any illegal immigrant resides in a property, it will be a criminal offence by the landlord regardless of whether or not that individual was the person to whom the premises were let.",3
What about the case where a house with a number of bedrooms has a drive and trees and is thus concealed from view Can the Minister suggest what reasonable steps could be taken to ensure that the person who has legally rented the premises is not allowing illegal immigrants to stay in the house?,3
Any person renting a house legally who then wishes to house illegal immigrants is hardly likely to announce their intention when taking the property.,3
It will be totally impractical for any landlord to monitor the ongoing use of the property and whether the person renting it has illegal immigrants to stay Proposed new Section 33A(7) states that a post-grant contravention is an offence.,3
"Can the Minister indicate the likely response time for the service and whether there will be charges for those using it, as the noble Lord, Lord Best, asked If it was simple for landlords to do what is being asked, why are the authorities not already monitoring illegal immigrants more effectively?",3
"It is not unreasonable for landlords to play their part in helping with the problem of illegal immigration, but what they are asked to do should be reasonable and proportionate.",2
"As drafted, the Bill has no defence for a landlord who has done their best to check the immigration status of a tenant, or for a landlord who is caught out by an unscrupulous tenant.",3
Checks part-way through or on renewal of a tenancy will leave landlords and agents with tenants who may then be deported; this will probably lead to a large number of random reports if tenants ignore correspondence or decline to provide documents.,3
"I support this amendment, as it provides clarity about when landlords will be expected to undertake the checks Amendment 150 in my name is supported by my noble friend Lord Howard and reads: “A person does not commit an offence under subsection (1) or (7) where they are proceeding diligently to evict an adult who is disqualified as a result of their immigration status from occupying the property of which that person is a landlord” As we have already heard, Clauses 13 to 15 make it an offence for a landlord to fail to check the immigration status of tenants who are subsequently found to be in the country illegally.",3
"This builds on the Immigration Act 2014, which requires landlords to check the immigration status of their tenants; the 2014 Act contained only the threat of civil penalties for landlords, and it is the Government’s plan for the checks to be rolled out across the country from February this year.",3
"It could well be that those same forged documents enabled the illegal immigrant to get into the country in the first place, as my noble friend said, but I do not believe that the immigration officers who allowed the immigrant into the country are deemed to have committed a criminal offence or are fined £3,000 or imprisoned for up to five years—so why the landlord?",3
"As a landlord, I do not see how I can possibly spot a forged document if immigration officers cannot, with all their sophisticated equipment.",3
"In Scotland, the SNP Government, apparently unwilling to accept the legitimacy of a UK-wide referendum, are already calling for another independence referendum and fomenting fresh divisions north of the border Of course, I would like to think that the majority who voted to remain in the EU or to leave did so purely on a point of principle.",3
"However, there were those on the leave side who disgracefully drew on those resentments and fears when the sole focus became immigration.",3
"It leads to feelings of rejection, alienation, anxiety and depression.",2
"Many people have come to these shores—Irish, Jews, Italians, people from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and from the Caribbean, and the recent migrants from Poland and elsewhere in Europe.",3
"What we must do now is to build on these values again—and with fresh energy Finally, if we were to baton down the hatches and not allow any more immigration, as some would wish, I would make a gentle reminder that the many hundreds of jobs—in the NHS and agriculture, in the hospitality industry, in transport and in every sector—would still have to be done.",3
"Enough home-grown Brits would have to be willing to do them I urge the Government, under their new leadership, to refrain from the scapegoating of immigrants that some in our main political parties and certain sections of the media have found politically expedient of late.",3
There is a very positive story to be told about the huge contribution made by immigrants to our country.,3
"As we move forward, it is important that our Government clarify their objectives on immigration and the means by which to achieve them This is a wake-up call to mend our country, to tackle poverty by providing jobs through small-scale manufacturing and other routes, to engender that work ethic and to encourage enterprise.",3
The national debate narrowed down to two issues: the economy and immigration.,3
Suffice it to say at this stage that we are in uncharted waters and that it is almost impossible to envisage what the future holds for us The issue that has concerned me most is the way the debate on immigration and migration has been handled.,3
"The issues that affect every citizen in our country include global terrorism, cross-border crime, human rights and matters relating to trafficking and drugs.",2
"Attacks on our Polish community, swastikas in children’s playgrounds, and attacks on mosques and temples bring back memories of the early days of migration to the United Kingdom Racial attacks and racial discrimination are now everyday realities in the lives of many migrants.",3
"Added to this, migrants face spitting, swearing, shoving and abuse almost routinely.",3
"The picture of fleeing refugees as a backdrop to a poster issued by UKIP, and classifying London mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan as a terrorist risk, are simply not acceptable.",3
Surely this is a recipe for disaster It is no longer a valid argument to talk about an integrated society if we continue to single out minorities as scapegoats for our own failures.,2
"Like it or not, immigration and free movement of people are even more necessary in the face of change resulting from the growth of the global economy.",2
"Increasingly, the global economy relies on the skills of people wherever they are available, and international movement is a key feature of all sound economies Few other political issues create the same tension and emotions as immigration and its implication for Britishness.",3
There is a kind of schizophrenia in the response to immigration on the one hand and community cohesion and a pluralist society on the other.,3
Migration policies are aimed at playing to public fears about mass immigration fanned by some of the media.,3
"The Government will recognise the work put in by Safe Passage, a branch of Citizens UK, in this regard When this amendment was put down I gladly added my name to it, as its first ask was for the Government to, “publish a strategy for the safeguarding of unaccompanied refugee children living in the United Kingdom and children who have been identified for resettlement in the United Kingdom under section 67 of this Act” When I read in detail the joint ministerial Statement by Edward Timpson, Minister of State for Vulnerable Children, and Robert Goodwill, Home Office Minister of State for Immigration, I was disappointed to find that, in committing to publish a strategy by May 2017, there was no mention of children who have been identified for resettlement in the UK under Section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016 Secondly, the amendment specifically asks that, in proposed new Section 67A(2)(b) of that Act, the Secretary of State, in formulating the strategy, must, “evaluate the procedures for, and speed of, resettling those unaccompanied refugee children who have been identified for resettlement in the United Kingdom under section 67 of this Act” Let us compare that to the Government’s response: “In developing our strategy we will evaluate the procedures for, and speed of, transferring unaccompanied asylum-seeking and refugee children who have been identified for transfer from Europe” That sounds okay—but, crucially, there is again no mention of children who qualify under Section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016 Furthermore, in paragraph 10 of the joint ministerial Statement, the Government again fail to include children who qualify under Section 67.",3
"The Statement says: “In taking forward this work my department will also revise the statutory guidance published in 2014 on the ‘Care of unaccompanied and trafficked children’ so it covers the safeguarding of children transferred under Dublin provisions and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who arrive spontaneously who then explain that they have family in the United Kingdom with whom they wish to live”.—[Official Report, Commons, 1/11/16; col.",3
"I suppose that by “children who arrive spontaneously” the Ministers were referring to minors who resort to taking their chances on the backs of lorries, in effect giving succour to the smugglers who profit by such activity.",3
"One report from a specialised children’s reception centre near the Spanish border states that nobody has been near the children at all; all they do is eat and sleep, and there is no official to ask any questions of, either I will leave it there.",3
"We agreed we needed to press ahead with strengthening the EU’s external borders to ensure that non-refugees are returned promptly, and to back the new mission to disrupt the criminal gangs working between Greece and Turkey, who are putting so many people’s lives at risk.",3
"After the hard work of the Home Secretary, we have secured new powers against criminals from other countries, including powers to stop them coming here in the first place, and powers to deport them if they are already here.",3
"We agreed longer re-entry bans for fraudsters and people who collude in sham marriages, and an end to the frankly ridiculous situation where EU nationals can avoid British immigration rules when bringing their families from outside the EU This agreement broke new ground, with the European Council agreeing to reverse decisions from the European Court of Justice.",3
"We have already made sure that EU migrants cannot claim the new unemployment benefit, universal credit, while looking for work.",3
"At this Council, we agreed that EU migrants working in Britain can be prevented from sending child benefit home at UK rates.",3
"This will apply first to new claimants, and then to existing claimants from the start of 2020 We also established a new emergency brake so that EU migrants will have to wait four years until they have full access to our benefits.",3
"All along, we have said that people should not be able to come here and get access to our benefits system straight away—no more something for nothing, and that is what we have achieved I am sure that the discussion about welfare and immigration will be intense, but let me make this point.",3
"In addition, our new safeguards lapse if we vote to leave the EU, so we might end up with free movement but without these new protections The fourth area in which we wanted to make significant changes was to protect our country from further European political integration and to increase powers for our national Parliament.",3
"We will be out of the euro, out of the eurozone bailouts, out of the passport-free, no-borders Schengen area, and permanently and legally protected from ever being part of an ever closer union Of course, there is still more to do.",3
"When it comes to people’s jobs, it is simply not enough to say that it will be all right on the night and we will work it out, and I believe that in the weeks to come we need properly to face up to the economic consequences of a choice to leave I believe that Britain will be stronger, safer and better off by remaining in a reformed European Union: stronger because we can play a leading role in one of the world’s largest organisations from within, helping to make the big decisions on trade and security that determine our future; safer because we can work with our European partners to fight cross-border crime and terrorism; and better off because British business will have full access to the free trade single market, bringing jobs, investment and lower prices There will be much debate about sovereignty, and rightly so.",3
Will we have the power to insist that European countries share with us their border information so we know what terrorists and criminals are doing in Europe?,3
"Or are we fearful of the outside world, feeling that the European Union is doing Europe to us rather than us being a part of Europe, and fearing the threat of immigration, because the concept of free movement of European citizens has been conflated with free movement of refugees, economic migrants and legal or illegal migrants from outside the European Union We face a whole host of problems: illegal migration, people trafficking, drug smuggling, terrorism, environmental pollution to our rivers and seas, and so on, and none of those things respect national boundaries.",3
"The EU has eliminated tariff barriers and customs procedures within its borders, and it has taken strides towards removing non-tariff barriers, such as goods regulations, across the board.",3
Terrorists do not respect international borders and nor must the fight against terrorism.,2
I was the Minister for Borders and Immigration who introduced the points system for non-EU immigration into this country.,3
"There are then questions about restrictions on low skill or high skill, how long visas should last, whether visa rights should lead to rights of settlement and citizenship, and what access to benefits should be enjoyed for taxes paid in.",3
"Of course, there is the huge question of how, as part of a new agreement on fair movement, this country steps up to its international obligations to help refugees struggling due to war in the middle east.",3
We should be doing far more to help Europe with the burden of giving safe haven to refugees fleeing war zones and make that part and parcel of our proposals for fair movement.,3
"Good neighbours do not shirk their duties, whether on climate change or common border protection.",3
Agreements reached in principle at the EU-Turkey summit on Monday represent a basis on which in future all migrants who arrive in Greece could be returned to Turkey.,3
"That would, if implemented, break the business model of the people smugglers, and end the link between getting in a boat and getting settlement in Europe.",3
"As we are not members of the Schengen area, we are able to maintain our own border controls and make our own decisions on asylum.",4
Nor would the United Kingdom be obliged to resettle any additional refugees.,3
We will not be part of the process of liberalising visas—that is a matter for Schengen countries—and we will still require visas for Turkish citizens to visit Britain The European Union also agreed on Monday to consider in due course extending the current financial support to help Turkey.,3
"We have already agreed to pay our £250 million share of the existing €3 billion Turkey refugee facility, and I made a written ministerial statement about that earlier this week.",3
"The Turkey refugee facility is designed to provide immediate humanitarian support and also to fund the schools, hospitals and housing required over the longer term to support refugees and the communities that host them The agreement at the EU-Turkey summit on Monday will ensure that the €3 billion commitment agreed at last November’s EU-Turkey summit is properly and expeditiously disbursed.",3
"The principle of closing off the dangerous smuggler routes and instead providing safe legal routes to sanctuary is clearly sensible, but the Minister will know of the legal, practical and political problems with the plans put forward.",3
"He rightly makes it clear that there will be no changes to Turkish visa arrangements for Britain, but I suspect that in many others areas of the proposals there will be significant changes in the week ahead.",3
"In particular, have the British Government raised the plight of Afghan and Iraqi refugees?",3
We know that about half the lone children who claimed asylum in Europe in January were from Afghanistan.,3
"My Lords, Clause 34 and this amendment deal with rights of appeal relating to persons who claim to have a right to remain in the United Kingdom on asylum or human rights grounds, but whose claim has been refused.",3
"Under the terms of the Bill, the Secretary of State will have the power to certify the claim for someone appealing on human rights grounds against an immigration decision so that they can only appeal from outside of the United Kingdom unless to do so would be in breach of their human rights This extends to all individuals the provisions that are already enforced for the deportation cases of former foreign national offenders, and will affect all those bringing human rights appeals under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, on the right to respect for private and family life.",3
"This is surely made far harder where those connections are severed by distance and time, enforced by deportation and delays in the tribunal system It is also vital not only to understand and obtain evidence, but to present it appropriately, which requires legal assistance, yet legal aid is not available for Article 8 appeals save on an exceptional basis.",3
"As a result, out-of-country appeals, for which the deadlines to lodge an appeal are often extremely tight, will not be pursued or will be pursued only inadequately, given the costs of taking forward an appeal as a privately paying individual from overseas.",3
"Under the Immigration Act 2014, the Secretary of State was given power to certify deportation appeals so that a foreign national offender subject to a deportation order can be removed before their appeal or during the appeal process if the Secretary of State decides that to do so would not cause serious irreversible harm—not just serious harm, but serious irreversible harm.",3
"Available data show that in the year since the provision came into force for foreign national offenders, the number of appeals against deportation brought out of country has dropped by 87% compared with the number brought in country in the year to April 2013.",3
"That suggests that many individuals are unable to appeal effectively a decision following removal from the UK, and that appeals which would have been successful are not being brought The available data indicate that “deport first, appeal later” has had an adverse impact on the ability of foreign national offenders—whom I appreciate may not be the most popular of individuals—to challenge a deportation decision, which suggests that this handicap will affect thousands more individuals if the provisions are extended, including many who have British or settled family members in the UK, such as partners and children.",3
"My experience may be the same as or different from that of other Members of Parliament in the other House, but I had so many immigration cases regularly that one out of my three caseworkers was solely devoted to dealing with them comprehensively.",3
"I felt that it pursued its statutory obligations very fully On the wider issue of Clause 34, my own experience was that the really difficult problem in dealing with immigration cases, whether they were economic migrants or asylum seekers, was the length of time the whole appeals procedure took.",3
This was the really big problem in dealing with immigrants Will this clause as it is improve that?,3
"We have evidence from the new procedures for dealing with visa applications, for example, on the hub and spoke principle brought in by the last Government, whereby visas were dealt with in a particular area—let us say Dubai for the whole of India, for example—and things were speeded up.",3
Those measures were brought in so that visa applications could be dealt with more rapidly than hitherto.,3
"If my noble and learned friend can tell me what experience and evidence we have that Clause 34 would speed things up, I would be in favour of it, because the real problem was the length of time that appeals took in immigration cases.",3
Clause 34 applies in respect of migrants who have been found to have no lawful right to be in the United Kingdom.,3
It does not apply to asylum cases Noble Lords will be aware that there is a long-established principle that persons can be removed or deported before an appeal is brought or heard.,3
"In 2014, the coalition Government used the Immigration Act to provide that arguable claims from foreign national offenders could be certified where deportation pending appeal would not cause serious irreversible harm or otherwise breach the person’s convention rights I emphasise that last point because of the observation made at the outset by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, about it being a case of serious irreversible harm.",3
"That will give rise to questions about children, which I will come on to address in a moment The power introduced in 2014 has yielded significant results because more than 230 foreign national offenders have been deported before appeal in the first year since it came into force, and more than 1,200 European national offenders have been deported under equivalent regulations In our manifesto, the Government committed to extend this power to apply to all human rights claims.",3
We suggest that it is in the public interest that we maintain immigration control across the board.,3
"We will always ask whether there are reasons why an effective appeal could not be brought from outside the United Kingdom, and any reasons given will be fully considered when deciding whether to certify such a case I am conscious of the observations that have been made about whether an appeal from overseas can be a fair or effective remedy.",3
Bringing an appeal from overseas does not mean it is less likely to succeed.,3
"In that context, the Court of Appeal confirmed that the Secretary of State for the Home Department was entitled to rely on the independent specialist judiciary of the Immigration Tribunal to ensure that an appeal from overseas was fair and that the process was in line with legal obligations that arose under the convention.",3
The amendment has been tabled to ensure that the best interests of any affected child are considered before a claim is certified so that an appeal must be exercised from overseas.,3
"The best interests of children in the United Kingdom are a primary consideration in any immigration decision, including the decision whether to certify under the new power.",3
"The point was also made that under existing legislation, and in particular in the case of Kiarie and Byndloss, one is dealing with foreign national offenders.",3
"However, with great respect, it does not appear that there is any material distinction to be made between the prospects of appeal for a foreign national offender and other migrants who have no right to be within the United Kingdom.",3
"I am sure that more needs to be done in that respect to meet that problem The noble Lord also referred to his recent visit to one of the immigration centres, of which I am aware and which he mentioned that he intended to make when we spoke a few days ago upon earlier parts of the Bill.",3
"Be that as it may, because she is a foreign national offender, she will not be subject to any out-of-country appeal under Clause 34; she is already subject to an out-of-country appeal procedure on the basis of existing legislation.",3
"No, I am not going to give way We have no objection to reviewing the franchise with regard to overseas citizens, but I hope the Government will take this point seriously and will be minded not only to look at those who have lived abroad for several decades, but to look at 16 and 17-year-olds in this country—old enough to marry, old enough to work, old enough to join the Army and rightly allowed to vote in the Scottish referendum, but not able to vote in our elections.",3
"We would welcome any proposals from the Government to reform the Prevent strategy and instead to emphasise the value of community-led work to prevent young people from being drawn into extremism in any form In foreign policy, we must put our promotion of human rights at the centre.",3
"We cannot continue to turn a blind eye and, worse, sell arms to those countries that abuse human rights either within or beyond their borders.",2
"Just a few weeks previously, this Prime Minister was referring to refugees fleeing persecution as “a bunch of migrants” and “a swarm”.",3
"I hope the Prime Minister will think again about them and recognise, as everyone should, that refugees are simply human beings, just like any of us in this Chamber, who are trying to survive in a very dangerous and very cruel world.",3
"The UK Government’s approach to immigration has been heavy-handed and one size fits all, and has only fuelled the misconceptions about migrants.",2
How about reversing changes to immigration laws that prevent UK citizens from living here with their partners and children from overseas?,3
"How about reversing cuts to support for asylum seekers, and adopting a strategy of providing integration opportunities from day one?",3
How about reintroducing a post-study work visa?,3
"I do not think we have had a satisfactory explanation for how we are going to protect our borders against intruders, whether they are people traffickers, drug smugglers or whoever.",3
"This time last year, he was saying he could envisage our leaving the EU at his request.",3
"They are pretty sceptical about the Government’s claims that if we remain in the European Union, we will be able to retain control over our borders—implying that we have control at the moment over who comes to our country and who leaves from the European Union, which we manifestly do not.",3
"Even if those people have criminal convictions, we cannot deport them or prevent them from coming because of their human rights and the European Union’s freedom of movement rules When we have assertions in the Gracious Speech that the Government are going to do lots of wonderful things, including building another 1 million houses, one has to ask the question: if we are that short of houses, why are we contemplating having 3 million more migrants from the European Union by the year 2030?",3
"I have already referred to the issue of sovereignty, but the only way to improve the number and quality of housing is to ensure that we do not experience this incredible pressure on our public services—forced on us by uncontrolled immigration Let me make a few further points.",2
Why can we not do more to ensure that foreign offenders can be deported rather than filling up our prisons?,2
That same consideration should be extended to the refugees fleeing Syria—they are human beings and they have human rights.,4
"We should greet them with blankets and food, not with the cold stare of a bureaucrat demanding to see passports and to take fingerprints.",3
"We should be sending aid to Greece, treating the flood of refugees as the humanitarian disaster that it is.",2
"The electronic system for controlling the UK’s borders, which began under the Blair Government, has cost tens of millions of pounds, and still does not work.",3
"How about a Bill to formalise good treatment of refugees, of asylum seekers, of human beings fleeing here in fear of their lives?",3
"UK foreign policy should include provisions to promote human rights, to stand against violence against women and girls and work towards equality There could be so much more than this small and narrow vision of what the UK is and can be.",3
"Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) said, accurately, that we have some pretty effective security arrangements at our borders and that the record shows not only that the chief terrorist threat to the United Kingdom too often comes from British citizens, but that there have been terrorist incidents abroad that have been brought about by people who were British born and bred.",3
"In Germany, it takes eight to 10 years for someone to get citizenship, and they have to have a clean criminal record, pass an integration test and show that they have an independent source of income.",4
It is probably because those tests are so rigorous that only 2.2% of refugees in Germany take German citizenship and get German passports.,3
"What we can and do do here is stop people, including EU citizens, at our borders and refuse entry to anyone about whom there is information of terrorist links.",3
I am also obviously concerned about unaccompanied child refugees in Greece and Italy There are two categories of children here.,4
"They are unaccompanied child refugees who arrived in Europe before 20 March—that is the Government’s wish—and who are now in Greece, Italy or Calais.",3
They sometimes use illegal techniques to stop the traffic so that they can get on the back of a lorry.,3
"I hope that we will not waste our money on a wall; anyway, it will not be that difficult for people to walk around the end of it My first key point is that it is important that all people in the Jungle, but particularly the children, are fully informed of what their rights are on claiming asylum.",3
"There is a view there that they do not want to claim asylum—that they have been persuaded, and want only to come to this country.",3
"Although I concede that quite a few have in the end claimed asylum, the ones who I spoke to thought that their only option was to come to this country.",3
"Of course, it is believed that there are traffickers and people smugglers in the Jungle, who have a vested interest in persuading others not to claim asylum in France.",3
"My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, for this debate and for his relentless campaigning on this subject I declare an interest as a board member of UNICEF UK, which arranged for me and my noble friends Lady Morris of Bolton and Lady Hodgson—neither of whom can be here today, sadly—to visit the refugee camp in Calais at the end of July.",3
"All the volunteers, including those working in the kitchens to feed the refugees, are doing amazing work.",3
"We felt humbled by them all We too were shocked by what we saw and heard: children afraid to leave their tents during the day, in case everything they had was taken from them, while every night they risk their lives in trying to enter the UK illegally.",3
"It is difficult to discount the pull factor with regard to the broader stance on the French and European migrant crisis; indeed, we met a number who wished that they had not come and were trying to get the message home to others not to make the journey.",3
"We should take on the traffickers and smugglers by ensuring that refugees are aware of their legal rights at the start of their journey as well as in Calais, as the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said Collectively our countries have achieved so much for humanity and have so much to be proud of, and it saddens me that there appears to be no solution to the plight of these desperate children in Calais.",3
Since I have been a Minister I have answered a question almost every day on the issue of not just migrants in Calais but children in Calais.,3
"More widely in Europe, we are in active discussions with the UNHCR, other partner organisations and the Italian and Greek Governments to strengthen and speed up mechanisms to identify and assess unaccompanied refugee children and transfer them to the UK where that is in their best interests.",3
"While I share his view that the welfare of children in Calais is paramount, I believe we should be acting in the best interests of the child, and for that reason we are focusing on prioritising family reunion cases Both the UK and French Governments are clear that those in France who require international protection should claim asylum in France.",3
"For unaccompanied children the UK will consider requests to take responsibility for an asylum application made in France when lodged by a minor with close family connections in the UK, and both Governments are committed to ensuring that such cases are prioritised.",3
"Since the beginning of this year, over 70 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children have been accepted for transfer to the UK from France under the family provisions of the Dublin regulation.",3
"We have also established a dedicated team in the Home Office Dublin unit to lead on family reunion cases for unaccompanied children On camp clearances, we recognise that there are indeed children living in the migrant camp in Calais.",3
"The picture so far is that 5,000 people have taken up alternative accommodation, and I must emphasise that no one is forced to remain in the camps, although I appreciate some of the stories that noble Lords have told about the difficulty of getting out of them To assist with the clearances, I understand that the French Government intend to create additional places in temporary accommodation centres and asylum accommodation places across France by the end of the year.",3
"Since November 2015, the FTDA has led a project on human trafficking in Calais called Aide aux Victimes de la Traite, which means support to victims of human trafficking.",3
"Crucially, they have legal and social work skills, can speak English and Arabic, and conduct daily patrols of the camps to identify victims of trafficking.",3
"The people identified by FTDA as vulnerable or potential trafficking victims are mainly young women or unaccompanied minors at risk of sexual exploitation or coercion to commit offences, and victims of violence from other migrants, mainly smugglers.",3
"It was three years since he had made his incendiary “rivers of blood” speech, and now he was returning to the subject of immigration.",3
"Mass immigration, Powell claimed, led to the native British seeing their towns “changed, their native places turned into foreign lands, and themselves displaced as if by a systematic colonisation.” Three members of the shadow Cabinet threatened to resign unless Mr Powell was sacked.",3
"I felt revulsion—I am sure many others did too—on seeing the image of Mr Farage proudly unveiling his “breaking point” poster, featuring Syrian refugees, a week before the referendum.",3
"Even though they are human beings, they seem to be aliens.",3
"Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr Duncan Smith) frequently made false claims that immigration, not austerity, is the reason that health, social care and schools are under pressure, fostering the myth that immigrants drain our resources rather than enhance them That is scaremongering in its most extreme and vile form.",3
Immigrants are accused of being the cause of all that and they are used as a natural target—that is what Vote Leave campaigners campaigned on.,3
"That was nothing to do with the six—it was to found an economic association that, as I say, turned into EFTA Over the years, we have still had what I sometimes regard as the same mindless approach to anything that has a Europe tag to it, relating to the colour of passports, women’s institutes’ cakes and straight carrots.",3
We are out of the euro; our borders are protected under the Schengen agreement; we have barriers to benefits for immigrants seeking them; and we are excluded from ever-closer union.,3
It is a far greater loss of sovereignty when we commit our armed services to the possibility of our servicemen dying under the command of foreign generals.,2
"We played a major part in the political co-operation in common foreign policy activity, which has been very useful for world peace.",3
What is required is an integrated structure of communication and response systems of information and intelligence- gathering and distribution.,3
"Every day the Daily Mail publishes pictures of refugees, asylum seekers or foreigners generally, making them look as sinister as possible, and it will of course go on doing that until June.",3
"For us, Europe is about working together to advance our shared prosperity and security; it is not about being sucked into some kind of European superstate—not now, not ever The draft texts set out in full the special status accorded to the UK and clearly carves us out of further political integration.",3
"Now, these are protections we could not have if Britain were outside the European Union Fourthly, we want to deal with the pressures of immigration, which have become too great.",3
It includes a new law to overturn a decision by the European Court which has allowed thousands of illegal migrants to marry other EU nationals and acquire the right to stay in our country.,3
"It has been a source of perpetual frustration that we cannot impose our own immigration rules on third-country nationals coming from the European Union, but now, after the hard work of the Home Secretary, we have a proposal to put that right There are also new proposals to reduce the pull factor that our benefits system exerts across Europe by allowing instant access to welfare from the day someone arrives.",3
"Already, EU migrants will no longer be able to claim universal credit—the new unemployment benefit—while looking for work.",3
"And, in key areas, treaty change is envisaged in these documents I believe we are making real progress in all four areas—but the process is far from over.",3
"What I say is that, first, we do not have to allow into our country foreign nationals resident in other states.",2
"That is why we keep our border controls Let us consider, for example, the situation in Germany.",2
"Getting German citizenship can take as long as 10 years and it is the product of a lot of work, tests and everything else.",4
"We must therefore, first, keep our Schengen no-borders agreement and, secondly, continue to exclude people if they are not European Union citizens and they do not have a visa.",3
"Thirdly, I should say that the changes here that mean that we can crack down on the fraudsters, criminals and sham marriages, and on those who are trying to get round our immigration controls, put us in a much better place to deal with the pressures of the future.",3
"My Lords, is it not clear that people smugglers and traffickers are able to persuade migrants to risk crossing the Channel despite the fact that their boats are unsafe and it is extremely dangerous to cross shipping lanes and so on, because they will be rescued and taken to the United Kingdom?",3
"Would it not frustrate the traffickers and people smugglers if we were absolutely clear that if people are rescued they will be returned to France, where, if they are genuine asylum seekers, they can anyway claim asylum?",3
"The leaders of the campaign do not care if our construction industry is deeply concerned that a severe shortage of skilled workers would arise on Brexit, that our hospitality industry would virtually collapse without migrant workers from mainland Europe, or that our banks, such as JP Morgan, have warned of severe job losses Brexiteers talk of increasing trade with countries such as China and India.",3
"It would be both foolhardy and disruptive” How dare those Brexit leaders such as Duncan Smith, Gove and Johnson, with near-zero commercial experience themselves, arrogantly challenge all those bodies and individuals that I have quoted today I said I was also saddened by so many of the older generation interviewed in our pubs and clubs just focusing on immigrants and immigration as a reason for voting “out”, as if, by a stroke on Brexit, our borders will be closed and the sad flow of refugees internationally stemmed.",3
"Their children and grandchildren would suffer through fewer job opportunities as foreign investors chose to invest within the EEC rather than the UK, where they would have to surmount tariff barriers to export to Europe.",3
"However, immigration is a reserved matter and the subject matter of all these amendments relates to parts of the Bill that remain within the immigration reservation which have not been devolved or transferred to a devolved legislature Amendment 72A relates to the measures to prevent illegal working on licensed premises.",3
"The Bill integrates protection against illegal working into the existing licensing regime, including by adding the Home Secretary to the list of responsible authorities for the purpose of the Licensing Act, by making the prevention of illegal working an objective of the licensing regime, and by requiring licence applicants to have the requisite right to work.",3
These provisions restrict the access of illegal migrants to private residential accommodation in the UK and concern the reserved area of immigration control.,3
"It could lead to separate immigration controls applying in different parts of the United Kingdom, which would be to no one’s advantage, and to illegal migrants moving to jurisdictions which are perceived to be more lax Amendment 236A relates to provisions in Part 5 which will make it easier to transfer unaccompanied migrant and asylum-seeking children from one local authority to another and enable the Secretary of State to require local authorities to co-operate in the transfer of unaccompanied migrant children from one local authority to another, should voluntary arrangements fail.",3
"Immigration is a reserved matter, and immigration legislation already provides a UK-wide framework for migrants’ access to local authority services.",3
"The dispersal of migrant children is not an area in which Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland have the competence to legislate and their consent is therefore not required for the UK Government to legislate in this area.",3
"We must help the countries from which the migrants come to establish more effective governance, combat corruption and improve their economic performance and opportunities, but this is a very difficult task.",2
"When one considers that one of the countries from which migrants come in very large numbers is Nigeria, which is one of the two largest economies in Africa, an oil-producing country and a country with many very rich people and many successful businesses, one can see that the issue is not simply a question of money, but of good government and a willingness of civil society to take up its responsibilities.",2
"Of course, where people are refugees from war and persecution, the European Union has obligations that it must observe, but many of the people we are talking about are not refugees in such a situation, and we must consider the repatriation aspect of the problem as well as other aspects The drivers behind the mass movement of people come from the countries from which they originate, but another aspect of the solution is to seek the support of the countries through which the migrants are passing.",4
"The more the borders of these countries can be strengthened and the more the flow of migrants can be tackled before they reach the Mediterranean, the better it would be.",2
"While the Governments of the European Union must fulfil their obligations to refugees and victims of persecution, it must be clear beyond doubt that the European Union cannot and will not accept all who wish to come here.",3
"The citizens of receiving countries have rights that must be respected, just as refugees and migrants have rights that must be respected.",4
"It brings benefits as well as problems, and it is a great pity that Governments in this country and elsewhere have not done more to bring home to public opinion the benefits that immigration has brought and continues to bring and why we will continue to need immigrants in this country.",2
We have also witnessed the emergence of a new kind of ruthless people smuggler.,3
These people smugglers now use smart technology to relay information through social media on the best routes into Europe and the current price lists for the various routes available.,3
"The middle route is the longest and most dangerous, particularly if carried out in a rubber dinghy As the report states, we believe that Operation Sophia is carrying out a successful role in providing a search and rescue function, but is doing little to destroy the people-smugglers’ business model—at times, indeed, quite the reverse.",3
"The lack of a stable regime in Libya is further hampering the situation and makes it exceptionally difficult for international organisations to control and monitor the situation on the ground We need to be able to differentiate more clearly between refugees and economic migrants, as the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat, has said, although I accept that there is a lot of grey space between the two: abuse by people smugglers of young and vulnerable migrants, particularly women and children, often leads one to become the other.",3
"We need to find new and effective ways to penalise the people smugglers, perhaps even by using the mechanisms of the International Criminal Court.",3
Last month I spent a day with UNHCR visiting refugees in Amman.,3
"Jordan currently has over 600,000 Syrian refugees registered with UNHCR, and is having to cope with over 1.5 million Syrian refugees in total.",3
"Although the media have, understandably, mainly concentrated on the camps, over 80% of the refugees in Jordan are living in towns and cities in rented accommodation, attics and basements and wherever basic accommodation can be found.",3
"He managed to flee legally to Jordan with his passport, and the majority of his family then followed.",3
The UNHCR field officer who was with me that day said it was one of the better examples of refugee accommodation that she had seen.,3
It was clear that his family wanted to return to Syria as soon as it was safe to do so The second refugee family we met was a Sudanese family living in very primitive accommodation.,3
The husband had fled by plane to Jordan on a medical visa after two of his brothers had been murdered in Darfur.,3
"I share those two stories with your Lordships because, in this fevered atmosphere of headlines in the media saying that hundreds of thousands of migrants are going to flood our shores, I believe it is our human duty to remember that behind each of these statistics lies a personal and often tragic story On the other side of 23 June, I sincerely hope that the British Government can again help to take the lead on these issues within the EU and in the international community.",3
"Despite the current populist rhetoric to the contrary, this is a challenge to which there are no quick-fix solutions, and we in Britain cannot solve the migrant crisis on our own.",2
They are also concerned that we have no control over the EU portion of immigration.,2
"In looking at Operation Sophia, we discovered that this early stab at trying to control immigration through Libya, across the Mediterranean to Sicily and Italy was not working at all well and that a much broader approach was required, as the noble Baroness, Lady Prashar, said in her remarks We need a two-pronged approach.",3
"The coastguards are patrolling a huge area of coastline and, inevitably, cannot deal with all the smugglers who are trying to get their poor immigrants across to Italy.",3
"In that way, we may be able to manage down to a level that people can accept the migrant flows that are appearing.",3
"Operation Sophia has done some very creditable work in its search and rescue role, but as we have heard and as the report concludes, it is unable to perform its mission of preventing illegal migration, at least not until it is able to operate in Libyan waters much closer to the launch point of the trafficking.",3
"Since that is the case, we shall need to reconsider in due course what will be required in practice to stem the flow of migration across the central Mediterranean route, always assuming—it is a very big assumption—that we have the political support of the Libyan Government Most member states of the EU have a good understanding of what is involved in migrant trafficking, and for obvious reasons much of that knowledge is related to the operations of traffickers within the destination countries themselves—how they exploit the people under their control.",3
"It is a long chain, as the noble Lord, Lord Patten, has said, and seems inexhaustible in its volume Our experience of trafficking in Europe has led us to understand how the market works, and how these people are exploited in prostitution, the construction industry and debt bondage.",3
"As Sophia has shown, those who are conducting the trafficking closest to our borders are seldom the ones who play a determining role.",3
Often the people who steer the boats are migrants themselves.,3
"The beneficiaries and organisers of the trade can be stretched across great distances, far removed from the Mediterranean coast, and they perform diverse functions The trade is conducted by merciless criminals, to be sure, but their facilitators can take the form of corrupt border guards, police, embassies and politicians.",3
"We know that tribal communities and settled municipalities alike conspire to earn money along the line, exploiting in their own economies the trafficked migrants who are effectively temporarily enslaved before they are moved on to another destination in the line.",3
"There has to be transport, an entrance point, the providing of identities and false documents, housing, which is often illegal, and work places, and financial mechanisms for foreign accounts, bribes and money-laundering.",2
"Unless it is to be purely ephemeral, going ashore and establishing a presence on Libyan territory in the foreseeable future carries some obvious risks—physical risks, certainly, but several political risks too, not least the one of acceptability To achieve any significant success in stemming the trafficking trade there will have to be close co-operation with the Libyan and other neighbouring Governments at all levels, including coverage of the domestic issues embedded deep within the culture and structures of Libyan society.",3
"We have heard of the inadequacy of the remit of Operation Sophia and the inadequate resources to deal with the flow of migrants, but at least lives have certainly been saved There are 7 billion people living on our planet and there are millions who are on the move, who would like to be on the move or who plan to be on the move, either internally or externally.",3
"Public opinion all over the world is divided as to how, in practice, to deal with this, the phenomenon of our age, ranging from the compassionate to the violently antagonistic Of course, determining in principle and in practice how to distinguish between genuine refugees from war, violence and persecution and those simply seeking a better life, in order to react appropriately, is hugely difficult.",3
"I mention this because what Operation Sophia has shown and the refugee influx has provoked is a need for a much more broadly based and coherent response from Europe In April 2014, working with the African Union, the EU agreed an action plan which focused on trafficking in human beings and all that flows from it.",3
"In part, the object of the exercise was to find a balance that would enable defined migrants who make it to Europe to be integrated successfully, and to deal with the issue of remittances, while looking towards the root cause of the migratory flows.",3
"This was taken further later that year with the Khartoum process, aimed at enhancing existing co-operation and specifically addressing the issue of people trafficking and smuggling.",3
"A substantial sum of money has been envisaged for this purpose Clearly, and ultimately, this phenomenon of our time, mass migration, will require something even more comprehensive and a fresh architecture.",3
"I welcome also the fact that the report on the EU’s action plan on migrant smuggling is being considered by your Lordships’ House I know we have all been deeply moved by the terrible sights we have seen of desperate migrants clinging to woefully inadequate crafts in the Mediterranean, of destitute and forlorn groups of survivors, and of the deeply shocking scenes of those who have drowned, some of them tiny children.",3
The illegal practice of people smuggling is one that preoccupies us all when we see the abject misery of those who have been exploited and exposed to mortal danger.,2
"We also urge that proper resources must continue to be made available to ensure that levels of policing are maintained One of the key issues raised by witnesses to the sub-committee was the fact that these migrants, as others have said, are refugees fleeing from war and violence, not, as has been suggested, economic migrants seeking a better life.",3
"It is therefore appropriate to refer to a refugee crisis, and we would support the EU action plan being amended to reflect the fact that victims of smuggling may be refugees—vulnerable people with complex needs.",3
"It is also crucial that the humanitarian needs of refugees are provided for and that proper services are provided for the many who have suffered intense trauma and violence, in addition to the needs for basic food and shelter, as was so well described by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Sheffield.",3
Paragraph 56 of the report urges the Government to participate fully in the Commission’s discussions regarding possible measures for dealing with the root causes of migrant smuggling.,3
"The UNHCR suggests a number of admission programmes, including the admission of relatives, humanitarian visas, community-based private sponsorship, medical evacuation, academic scholarships and resettlement schemes.",3
"Our report makes the point that these too need to be considered Many of our witnesses, including the Refugee Council and Amnesty International, urged the Government to participate in the EU measures for the relocation of migrants and criticised the action plan for not giving this objective sufficient priority.",3
"The action plan, rightly, distinguishes between human trafficking and people smuggling.",3
"I very much support the recommendation that the 2004 directive, requiring member states to provide residence permits to victims of human trafficking, should be extended to smuggled migrants who have assisted in criminal proceedings against people smugglers As the noble Baroness, Lady Prashar, said, we are confronting the greatest humanitarian crisis to have faced the European Union since its foundation.",3
It is clear that the enormous number of refugees seeking to come to Europe is unlikely to reduce in the near future.,3
"However, it will be vital that member states, including the UK, collaborate and show responsibility and leadership if there is to be any progress in addressing this crisis and providing basic safety for so many people in need The prospect of generations of children being abandoned in barely adequate refugee camps or being left to the mercies of human traffickers and organised crime is chilling, and it is fertile territory for those who practise terrorism.",3
"My Lords, we read every day that immigration has become the central issue in the referendum, and perhaps it will determine the outcome of the vote.",3
"The present situation in Greece, Italy, France and probably Germany, which now has a backlog of 460,000 asylum cases, is already unsustainable.",3
"Command and control should be in the hands of the UN, as the noble Lord, Lord Soley, has indicated Secondly, the EU has failed to make, let alone implement, practical but crucial distinctions between asylum seekers, refugees and economic migrants.",3
"Nor has it produced reliable methods of identifying Islamist jihadists who have been infiltrating the present crisis Thirdly, the EU Commission has been focusing on the symptoms: the people smugglers who have caused so many deaths with unscrupulous methods by both land and sea.",3
"As we now know from my noble friend Lord Tugendhat’s report, although the EU’s Operation Sophia has, wonderfully, been saving 1,000 lives a day, it has failed to reduce illegal migration or deter the criminals who facilitate it.",3
"Indeed, for the coming summer surge of migrants across the English Channel, it would probably be cheaper and more humane to issue them with Eurostar train tickets if, when intercepted, they cannot be returned directly to the country from which they set sail Fourthly, the EU Commission has laid down for each Schengen state unenforceable and unenforced quotas for the number of immigrants to be received.",3
"In part, that is because the Turks are demanding visa-free entry into Europe, which EU Governments will not grant; added to which they have also been given the prospect of EU membership.",3
"Also, from last week, the repatriation of migrants to Turkey is being challenged in the European Court of Justice on multiple human rights grounds, ironically by two Pakistanis being held on the Greek island of Lesbos.",3
"In practice, economic migrants will not be deterred until the standard of living in the countries to which they wish to move is only marginally higher than what they have at home.",3
"I return, therefore, for the third time, to my proposal for a holding area, probably in Libya, to which migrants would be transferred.",3
"It is in a state of chaos with an expanding ISIS presence, for which the international community bears quite a bit of responsibility, and where military intervention, probably by the West, will soon become necessary I have no time to repeat all the details, except to say that it envisages using solar power for desalination of the sea, thus making the desert bloom, and the use of NATO forces in blue helmets under UN mandate to establish, administer, protect and guard the holding area to which all migrants can be taken.",3
"The current problems and perception in Britain have to be faced head on I have risen in this House previously to point to the many legal migrants in this country, particularly from the EU but also from elsewhere, and the huge contribution they make, but I am afraid that in the way this debate is often handled people conflate illegal and legal migration, not recognising that the vast number of people in Britain who were not born here are here legally and are contributing enormously to the community.",3
"Frankly, whatever the rights or wrongs may be, Europe will not accept unlimited numbers of refugees, as Chancellor Merkel is currently finding out We are also in a situation where, as our Prime Minister said, many, “are not asylum seekers, but people seeking a better life”.—[Official Report, Commons, 3/6/15; col.",3
Most of the legal migrants in Britain are here seeking and finding better lives.,2
But we have to look at ways in which we can deal with the problem of illegal migrants.,2
"All you have to do is get on a boat and be rescued, as opposed to sink, and you are okay.",3
Why do we not look at the lorries as they get on boats to come to Britain?,4
"If we want to control borders, let us start by taking the legitimate steps within our own hands to control our own borders We also need a slightly less sentimental attitude towards some of the illegal migrants who are here.",3
"I was interested to see last Sunday—I am looking at the right reverend Prelate, because this is largely about his profession—Reverend Pete Wilcox, Dean of Liverpool, who has baptised 200 asylum seekers in the past four years.",3
"He said: “Mixed motives are not unheard of” Later he admitted that, “there was no similar rush to convert to Christianity from Muslims who already had British citizenship” It would appear that that is a fairly open loophole.",4
"The reverend prelate also said: “I can’t think of a single example of somebody who already had British citizenship converting here with us from Islam to Christianity” That is clearly an abuse of process, and there is a lot more in this article and elsewhere.",4
We need to toughen up a little because it is not fair to the legal migrants who are here if we behave in that way All migrants in Britain should be treated properly and should be given an honoured place in society because they work very hard when they are here.,3
Its purpose is to disrupt people smuggling in the southern central Mediterranean through gathering information and intelligence and by destroying boats used by people smugglers.,3
"The committee’s report indicates that the operation has not been an outstanding success to date, with no arrests of key figures in the smuggling networks, no effective disruption of the networks since the operation acts only on the high seas, and an inability so far to even operate in Libyan waters, let alone onshore, with the weakness of the Libyan state being a key cause of the rise in smugglers using that route through the Mediterranean.",3
"It goes on to state that there is an urgent need to address the root causes of irregular migration to Europe and calls on the European Union to build resilience in the countries of origin, target the profits of the smugglers, provide support in-country and inform and engage the public on the phenomenon of the mass movement of people.",3
"If there is to be a coherent and sustainable solution to the irregular migrant crisis, there must be a crackdown on those who seek to take advantage of people in their time of need, and that means dismantling and putting out of action, by bringing to justice, the ruthless criminal networks that organise the precarious and dangerous journeys of large numbers of migrants who are desperate to reach Europe The second EU committee report we are discussing, which is on the EU action plan against migrant smuggling, considers the broader strategic challenges of migration policy and recognises that migration to Europe is part of a much larger phenomenon of the mass movement of people globally from the developing to the developed world, with the countries of western Europe, whether in the EU or not, acting as a magnet to those in the Middle East and Africa The purpose of the committee’s report was to look at the 2015 EU action plan against migrant smuggling ahead of the European Commission’s own review of the legislation on migrant smuggling which is due to be published this year along with proposed reforms.",3
"The action plan, which is one aspect of the European Commission’s 2015 European Agenda on Migration, sets out four priorities: enhanced police and judicial response; improved gathering and sharing of information; enhanced prevention of smuggling and assistance to vulnerable migrants and stronger co-operation with third-world countries The aims of the committee’s inquiry were to assess how the action plan against migrant smuggling contributes to the stated objectives of the EU’s agenda on migration; to establish whether or not its four objectives and the actions set out are the right ones to achieve the EU’s stated goal of rendering migrant smuggling a “high risk, low return” undertaking; to identify whether the action plan strikes the right balance between security considerations and the protection of migrants’ human rights; and to identify gaps and deficiencies in the current EU response to migrant smuggling in order to make recommendations for planned legislative reform The committee’s report reached a number of conclusions and made a number of recommendations; they appear overall to have been rather more enthusiastically received by the European Commission than they have by the Government, judging by the tenor and content of the respective responses.",3
"Its recommendations for creating safe and legal routes for refugees to enter the EU, and its regret that the Government have declined to participate in the EU measures for the relocation of migrants—allied to their urging that the Commission and all member states should make greater efforts to reach consensus on EU proposals on relocation and resettlement—did not go down well with the Home Office.",3
"The Home Office Minister for Immigration reiterated the government line on providing support to those countries facing particular pressures, with the focus on helping the most vulnerable who remain in the region which migrants arriving in Europe have left.",3
"It was abolished by the incoming Government in 2010, which was not exactly a far-sighted or enlightened move The response to the committee’s report from the European Commission refers to the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, which was set up to promote the efficient management of migration flows and the implementation, strengthening and development of a common EU approach to asylum and immigration, as well as to regulate specifically when emergency assistance could be activated.",3
"The EU Commission allocated emergency assistance funding to France last August to set up a site offering humanitarian assistance to around 1,500 irregular migrants and to support the transport of asylum seekers from Calais to other locations in France.",3
The Commission’s response also refers to the setting up this year by Europol of a fully operational European migrant smuggling centre as part of the creation of a hub for sharing information on migrant smuggling in the EU.,3
"The EU’s intention is to seek tailor-made partnerships with key third countries of origin and transit to achieve results with the priorities being saving lives at sea, increasing returns, enabling migrants and refugees to stay closer to home and, in the long term, helping third countries’ development in order to address the root causes of irregular migration.",3
In their response to the committee’s report the Government say that they are participating fully in the EU’s discussions regarding all possible measures for dealing with the root causes of migrant smuggling at ministerial and working levels through playing a leading role in the implementation of the actions agreed by the EU and African partners at the Valletta summit last November.,3
"Can the Minister say what “playing a leading role” means in terms of specific actions that we have taken or have committed to take Also in response to the committee’s report, the Government say that they are working to assist in building greater judicial and law enforcement capacity from source and transit countries for the migration crisis as part of the Organised Crime Taskforce by exploiting every opportunity at source, in transit countries and Europe, to destroy the operating model of organised crime groups involved in organised immigration crime.",3
"My Lords, I would like to thank the European Union Committee for producing its report on the EU action plan against migrant smuggling and its report on Operation Sophia, and to thank all those who have spoken in this debate I would like to touch on some of those contributions for a moment.",3
"In order to see these in context, it is important to remember that as a nation we must maintain border security.",3
We must maintain a coherent immigration policy.,2
The Government’s opinion is that there is little evidence to support the proposition that providing opportunities for a small number of migrants to travel legally from source countries will have any significant impact on the very large numbers of migrants who are prepared to travel illegally into the European Union.,3
But we will all accept that these smugglers are ruthless criminals.,3
The noble Baroness also made the point that it is important to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants.,3
"Indeed, we find that so many of those who present themselves as refugees, as asylum seekers, are in reality economic migrants.",3
"One has to acknowledge that the more economic migrants come forward to claim that they are asylum seekers, the greater the pressure on our resources and therefore the more difficult it is to process those who are genuinely refugees.",2
"Indeed, I note in passing that more than 90% of the asylum claims in the United Kingdom are made by persons already here, and who have therefore arrived illegally or under a visa and overstayed their visit.",3
"Indeed, we ought to try to maintain a system whereby we give temporary shelter to genuine asylum seekers so they can return in due course.",3
They are maintaining facilities for many refugees who want to remain in the Middle East and want the opportunity to return to their own country in due course.,3
"On specific improvements arising from the implementation of the task force, I suspect that it is too early to say that there are improvements we can isolate and report on, but, again, if there are, I undertake to include that in my letter We have to remember that the EU action plan against migrant smuggling is intended to shape the EU’s law enforcement response to immigration crime.",3
It sets out concrete actions to counter and prevent organised immigration crime.,3
"In order to be successful it must include a humanitarian response, law enforcement activity and capacity building in source countries Of course, some of those making the dangerous journey to Europe are fleeing conflict but others are economic migrants.",3
That is why we are leading the argument in Europe about the importance of breaking the link between these journeys and achieving settlement in Europe for those who are not refugees.,3
We are playing a leading role in tackling organised immigration crime.,2
"Its purpose is to exploit every opportunity to identify and tackle people smugglers The Organised Immigration Crime Taskforce is working in 17 countries, giving UK law enforcement unprecedented reach in source and transit countries.",3
"Between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2016, immigration enforcement achieved 175 disruptions against criminals involved in organised immigration crime.",3
"There were weapons, ammunition and smuggled cigarettes on board and, had the vessel reached Libya, there is strong evidence that it would have made the return journey with migrants on board The task force is also working to enrich the intelligence picture.",3
"There, they are assisting other agencies to gather intelligence from migrants arriving at external EU borders.",3
"This information is passed to the host member state for it to disseminate to law enforcement agencies The UK also engages closely with the European Migrant Smuggling Centre—which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, and I think by the noble Baroness, Lady Prashar—which leads for Europol on organised immigration crime.",4
"We are working closely with the French, Dutch and Belgians to increase the security of ports with links to the United Kingdom and increase co-operation against organised immigration crime.",3
"Activity will continue to determine what additional operational, technological and infrastructure assistance could be provided at relevant ports As well as pursuing the criminal gangs involved in immigration crime, the UK is also working with source countries to address the root causes of migration.",3
"The UK’s support is helping refugees to remain in host countries in the region and supporting host countries to accommodate them In Libya, the UK is supporting the Government of National Accord to regain control of Libyan borders and tackle the organised crime groups.",3
"Since its inception last summer, Operation Sophia has destroyed more than 120 smuggling boats on the high seas, apprehended more than 70 suspects and saved more than 15,000 lives.",3
"But the smugglers are of course adept at changing their tactics, so we must be aware of that and be prepared to respond.",3
That is why we have agreed with EU partners to expand Operation Sophia’s scope to include activity to build the capacity of the Libyan coastguard and to prevent the trafficking of illegal arms into Libya.,3
"We remain committed to moving to the later phases of Operation Sophia, to prevent smugglers putting to sea, once the right conditions are in place.",3
This activity will help secure the coast of Libya and harden the operating environment for people smugglers The Prime Minister also announced that we will seek to commit a second ship to Operation Sophia to tackle arms smuggling to Libya.,3
"The arms that are illegally supplied from the Mediterranean reinforce violent armed groups, and Daesh in particular.",2
Countering the flow of weapons and military equipment will support the wider effort to promote stability in Libya and a stable Libyan Government The work of Operation Sophia is just one element of wider UK efforts to support the humanitarian needs of migrants.,3
"Some £60 million of this is allocated to Europe to provide lifesaving aid to migrants and refugees, as well as support to Governments to build their capacity to manage arrivals.",3
"I say that in response to the observations of the noble Lord, Lord Rosser In the Horn of Africa we are supporting the Khartoum process that was mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, which focuses on combating organised immigration crime and human trafficking in the region.",3
The goal of the process is to encourage member countries to work in a co-operative manner to tackle the shared challenge of organised immigration crime.,3
It is not easy and requires us to engage with certain regimes when we might otherwise not wish to do so The law enforcement approach outlined in the EU action plan against migrant smuggling is one element of the EU’s response to the migration crisis.,3
"This is complemented by the United Kingdom’s law enforcement, as well as wider activity such as Operation Sophia to meet the humanitarian needs of migrants, tackle the root causes of migration and respond to the ever-developing challenge posed by criminal people smugglers —and in that we maintain our intent.",3
"It is simply unacceptable that, despite agreeing to the UN Human Rights Council resolution and the public statements made on this issue, we are still hearing about cases of torture, illegal detention and sexual violence.",3
"Where these abuses take place, we must use every bit of our diplomatic muscle to ensure that British citizens are protected—never mind the fact that Tamil people who do not have the British citizenship also deserve to go about their lives with dignity and freedom With those worrying cases in mind, will the Minister inform us of the action he is taking to make it clear to his counterparts in the Sri Lankan Government that these abuses cannot be allowed to continue?",3
Will he also inform the House what funding arrangements the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has in place to promote human rights abroad and how much of those funds is spent on Sri Lanka and for what purpose Many members of the Tamil community have raised with me the issue of deportations from the United Kingdom to Sri Lanka.,3
"When a person reaches the United Kingdom as an asylum seeker, we must do all we can to make sure that they are treated with respect and dignity.",4
It is clear that the UK Government must look again at their policy in respect of Tamil asylum seekers.,3
"This makes the basis of a trade deal simple: so long as neither party changes the relevant rules, passporting will continue after exit in the same way as before.",3
"This would give both parties the right to change the rules in a relevant area, bearing in mind that a rule change might affect the continuing passporting rights of those businesses which export from the UK to the EU or vice versa.",3
There is every prospect of a negotiation which would reach an outcome which is perfectly satisfactory to both sides I will say a word about immigration.,3
"During the debates on the referendum, I frequently made the point that the referendum should not have been about the level of immigration into our country.",3
"It should have been, and to a large extent was, about who should decide the level of immigration into our country.",3
There are those who think we need our current level of immigration.,2
"Let us argue it out and decide it here in this country as does every other country in the world except the members of the European Union and Norway and, for the moment, Switzerland As so many of your Lordships have said during this debate, let us not begin to entertain any suggestion that immigrants who are here legally, including those from the European Union, should be used as bargaining chips.",4
I do not believe for a moment that any of our European neighbours will want to round up and deport citizens of the United Kingdom who live and work within their borders.,4
"Despite having Objective 1 status, an agricultural area and fishing, the rhetoric of sovereignty—“We want our country back”—and immigration—“I’m not a racist, but …”—pointed very clearly to Cornwall voting to leave.",3
Most recently we have worked together on cyber and hybrid warfare and on helping refugees in the Aegean Sea.,3
We are equally important to our western-facing allies and to those sharing a border with Russia.,3
"Our coast will need patrolling—and not just the Straits of Dover but elsewhere, where we know the unscrupulous trafficking of people and drugs takes place.",3
"Were he in his seat, I am sure the noble Lord, Lord West, would be calling for gunboats in the Channel—but he does make a serious point.",3
So where will we keep our boats?,3
"But Brexit will mean that we lose our place in this forum, along with the loss of access to key EU institutions and EU foreign policy networks—and, of course, the international arrest warrant There is no denying that the world has become more dangerous in recent years.",3
"Clause 2 sets out the penalties for those offences: a fine or a maximum prison sentence of six months, and—this is important—a deportation order, which would take effect unless the Home Secretary deemed it to be against the public interest Currently, the United Kingdom is effectively a soft touch for illegal migrants.",3
"Very few are caught, and those who are caught are given a slap on the wrist; extremely rarely are they deported.",3
"That gives illegal migrants, and their traffickers, a perverse incentive to head for the United Kingdom, and, in the case of those who come here lawfully, to overstay I have raised this issue with the Immigration Minister on several occasions, most recently when attempting to add a new clause to the Immigration Bill on Report on 1 December 2015.",3
"He said: “there are already criminal sanctions and removal…powers in place…Section 24 of the Immigration Act 1971 in particular sets out criminal sanctions for various types of unlawful migrant behaviour, including illegal entry and overstaying.” That is, of course, absolutely correct, but my response to the Minister then—and it is the same today—was that in the last year for which figures were available, “there were only 72 convictions in magistrates and Crown courts for all the offences mentioned in section 24”.—[Official Report, 1 December 2015; Vol.",3
"Having been challenged on that point, the Minister went on to explain that the purpose was not to prosecute people, saying: “Our primary sanctions for immigration non-compliance are removal and civil penalties, which is why, in many respects, prosecution numbers are relatively low.” —[Official Report, 1 December 2015; Vol.",3
"There are fewer than two prosecutions a week for illegal immigration, although we can see on our television screens exactly what is happening just across the channel.",3
"Attempts, many of which are successful, are being made every day by hundreds of illegal migrants.",3
"I would indeed like to see such a process, but for deportation rather than extradition.",3
"The Bill specifically states that if illegal migrants are convicted, the courts should recommend deportation as a matter of course, but that is, at present, very much the exception.",3
"As a consequence, as soon as people arrive in this country—although they may have come here by means of subterfuge, with false documents and so on—they think that if they are caught, they will effectively never be deported We know that, currently, a mass—tens of thousands—of what are described as failed asylum seekers are in this country, and have not been deported.",3
"The figures, which I have somewhere, suggest that the number of deportations of failed asylum seekers is at a 10-year low, yet we know that the number of people seeking asylum last year was at a record high.",3
Why are so few of those people being deported?,2
"Given those figures relating to failed asylum seekers, how can the Government say that their focus is on “removal…rather than prosecution”, because removal is less quick and less costly?",3
"We know that of those who have come here illegally, fewer were subjected to enforced removal last year than in any of the previous 12 years for which we have statistics.",3
"Friends often say that during that period, the Labour Government were a soft touch when it came to illegal migrants.",3
"That information comes from the most recently published Home Office immigration statistics, relating to 2015 Public anxiety about illegal immigration is at an all-time high, but the Government’s effectiveness in tackling it is, in my submission, at an all-time low.",3
"It suggests someone who might have a mild medical condition Equally inadequate was Lord Bates’ reply when he was asked “what difference do the Government estimate that the Prime Minister’s so-called EU reforms will make to the figures” Lord Green had stated earlier that migration levels could lead to “an increase in our population of half a million every year, of which 75% will be due to future immigration” The Minister, Lord Bates, accepted that Lord Green had been “correct in saying that if you use the statistical data available to forecast, you arrive at roughly the numbers he referred to.” He accepted the premise of the question, but when he was asked what the effect would be of the so-called reforms that the Prime Minister came back with following the renegotiations, he said: “Of course, we must see what effect they will have, going forward.”—[Official Report, House of Lords, 29 February 2016; Vol.",3
"The Government keep saying that our relationship with the European Union will be debated on the facts, but they cannot even bring any facts to bear in answer to that precise question The whole purpose of the Bill is to reduce illegal immigration by identifying, prosecuting and deporting those already here illegally and deterring others who might be planning to come here illegally.",3
"The Government have very little idea how many foreign nationals are in this country illegally, or so they say.",3
"I have some figures that have been produced by the House of Commons Library, and they basically show that the Government have no idea how many illegal migrants there are here.",3
One of the problems is that many of the people who are already here illegally do not have any documents.,2
"They do not have passports, so I am not sure that they would wish to exit the country using authorised routes.",4
"Friend has said Whatever the number of illegal immigrants in this country might be, they are certainly continuing to arrive in record numbers.",2
"The report points to the fact that many more than 100,000 migrants entered the United Kingdom illegally last year.",3
"It also states that more than 900,000 of the 1 million migrants who entered the EU last year used the services of criminal groups of people smugglers who were heavily connected to organised crime.",3
"It identifies the UK, Germany and Sweden as the three preferred destination countries and makes it clear that almost all migrants eventually reach their chosen destination, undertaking what the report describes as “secondary movements”.",3
"It refers to document counterfeiting having increased significantly, to corruption being rife and to migrant smuggling routes and networks being used to infiltrate potential terrorists, which we know sadly happened during the Paris attacks last November The report states that the EU needs to be firm with those who do not need protection, who pose a security risk or who refuse to co-operate with the asylum process.",3
"We now have a system of hotspots that is designed to ensure the rapid return of those without a legitimate asylum case, but again that is not happening Another indication of the number of people who may be here illegally came in December 2013, when, following a claim in 2010 that the Government did not have any information on this matter, the Government issued the publication, “Sustaining services, ensuring fairness: Government response to the consultation on migrant access and their financial contribution to NHS provision in England” Just as a side issue, let me say that we saw in the papers yesterday that there is a great imbalance between the amount of money that our country pays out to EU countries in respect of the healthcare of British citizens in Europe compared with the amount that we charge European citizens using our health service here The NHS document suggested that, at any one time in England, there are about 2.5 million overseas visitors and migrants, of whom 450,000 are from the European economic area, and about 580,000 are irregulars, who include failed asylum seekers liable to removal, people who have overstayed their visas and illegal migrants.",3
"Even back then—in 2013—the health service statistics suggested that there were the best part of 600,000 people here Earlier today, courtesy of the Mail Online, I listened to what the Home Secretary said to the Conservative party conference in 2014 about the determination of herself and the Government to reduce the number of appeal rights and the number of appeals by foreign criminals against removal from our country.",3
She rightly referred to the abuse of article 8 and the emphasis on foreign criminals and illegal immigrants trying to rely on family connections.,3
"At the outset of her speech, she said that she was going to extend the number of “deport first, hear appeals later” cases It was with some dismay that I read, on 28 February, in the Mail on Sunday that a Romanian rapist, who had been removed from Britain, had been allowed back in by judges who ruled that his fast-track deportation broke EU law and breached his human rights.",3
"He had come to this country illegally, stayed in this country illegally and then, when the rules changed for Romania to join the European Union, he was able to stay here as an EU citizen.",4
The Government have always said that they wish to maintain control of our borders so that we do not have to tolerate criminals from the rest of the EU in our country.,3
"Even in a case as strong as that, the courts have intervened to prevent him from being deported from this country The same article refers to another case in which a violent Slovakian sent home under the deport first rule had won the right to return to the United Kingdom for his appeal hearing.",3
"The Home Office had said: “The UK will seek to deport any EU national whose conduct represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat.” The only problem is that, under our present arrangements with the European Union, we are incapable of being able to deliver on that intent.",3
"The only way, in my submission, that we will ever be able to deliver on it is by leaving the European Union, and that is increasingly the conclusion to which people are coming In 2014, the Prime Minister said that he recognised that this was a really serious issue, that we needed to take control of our borders, that we needed to reduce the levels of migration to the tens of thousands and that he was going to secure that through fundamental reform of the European Union.",3
"Without fundamental reform, we cannot do anything about these illegal people from the European Union, as exemplified by the case to which I have just referred My Bill would cover not just those from the European Union, but illegal migrants more generally.",3
"If there are 1 million-plus illegal migrants in this country at the moment, this Bill would enable the Government to get to grips with the matter and to get the authorities working on it.",3
"If we got tough with illegal migrants in our country, the people smugglers would divert them away from the United Kingdom, as they always try to use the weakest points of entry.",2
"I do not think that we should have such a requirement, but the fact that we do not have it means that people who are illegal migrants can lie low here for years and years and we do not know anything about them.",2
"They come to light only when they are convicted of an offence, and by then we are told that they have been here for too long and we cannot get rid of them This is a mega crisis in immigration.",3
"It is important that we debate it and that the Government take these arguments seriously and reply to them, because, frankly, in terms of illegal entry into this country, the system is out of control.",2
"If someone decides illegally to enter the channel tunnel, which is a very dangerous thing to do in any circumstances, and they cause massive disruption, delaying train after train, delaying hundreds of people going on holiday or returning, or, even more important, preventing people from getting to business appointments, and if someone actually walks through the entire length of the channel tunnel, what people cannot understand is why, when they are caught, having caused that massive, criminal disruption, there apparently are no consequences.",3
"Let us say that one of his lorries arrives in Lincoln, the back of it is opened, and out jump half a dozen illegal migrants, and Mr Denby rings the police.",3
Are the migrants prosecuted?,3
"Are they given, perhaps, a modest prison sentence but then deported?",3
People arrive in this country illegally.,2
"The Bill is particularly apposite because the whole issue of juxtaposed controls, by which someone can have their passport checked on the French side of the channel if they are trying to enter England, is front-page news today, given President Hollande’s remarks yesterday How extraordinary that the President of France, the President of a friendly country—everybody knows how francophone and francophile I am: there is no more francophile or francophone person in this House—should say that if the British people exercise their democratic right in a referendum to leave the EU there will “be consequences” in Calais.",3
"He did not actually mention Calais—I think he said he did not want to be too alarmist—but the interpretation of all his remarks is that if we were to leave the EU, he would move the borders.",3
"I noticed that although there were no border checks between the two countries, there were loads of gendarmes checking every single coach and car at the first péage, where people pay the tolls for the motorway.",3
"The annual cost of the Border Force at the port of Calais per fiscal year is also quite extraordinary: in 2013, it had risen to more than £17.5 million The independent chief inspector of borders and immigration published a report on the inspection of juxtaposed controls in 2013.",3
"However, the Home Affairs Committee noted in March 2015 that clandestine migrants caught in Calais or Coquelles are still not fingerprinted by the UK authorities, unlike at other juxtaposed controls.",3
"No matter how many times people try, there is no criminal sanction or disbenefit—the migrants simply try again and again.",3
And yet we have seen no evidence that France or the UK is pursuing a policy of processing and deporting the individuals found at Calais.,3
"We find it bizarre that there are thousands of attempts to enter the UK illegally through Calais, at great cost and inconvenience to business and leisure travellers, transport companies, and hauliers, and yet the people who are caught are simply released back into the French countryside.” Extraordinary “Nothing in this process appears to serve as a disincentive to returning to Calais and trying again and again, and there is no evidence it has affected the number of migrants living in the Calais area.",3
"It appears to be an admission of stalemate and something must be done to break this cycle.” The Committee goes on: “It is apparent that extra security slows the traffic, creates queues”— as I go back and forth to the Council of Europe, I am well aware of this— “and can increase the vulnerability of the lorries to infiltration by migrants.",3
"Improvements in security must be combined with improvements in managing the traffic flow.” That, surely, is the point We can build as many fences or walls as we like, but we cannot manage the migrant flow unless the Government make real, cogent and serious attempts, first, to get rid of the incentive through something like my hon.",3
"Friend, is that we also have to deal with the pull factor This illegal migration into this country is very serious in terms of public policy.",2
"Some people might say, “Maybe we want more immigration—maybe these people provide low-cost cheap labour”, and all the rest of it.",3
"I would argue that the ready availability of cheap labour reduces the need for employers to modernise their economy, and that for too long Governments have relied on open borders and cheap wages to keep the economy afloat.",3
"The problem with this large-scale migration—illegal migration is the worst aspect—is that it is totally unsustainable in the long run in terms of the economy, public policy and public opinion The Chancellor has signalled his intention that we end this model and move towards a low tax, high wage society.",3
"Lord Rose, the head of the remain campaign, admitted before the Treasury Committee this week that if Britain leaves the EU and immigration within the EU falls, then wages will rise.",3
"The more immigration there is, particularly the more illegal immigration, the more consequences there will be Untrammelled immigration was introduced in 1997 for social reasons.",2
The then Government gambled on newly arrived immigrants and their offspring being reliable Labour supporters—not always the case—so they adopted the Brechtian policy of abolishing the people and electing another version.,3
"The debate has moved on, in the Conservative party and in the Labour party, and there is now widespread public support for a really tough, firm and compassionate immigration policy.",3
The study estimated the number of unauthorised migrants living in the UK in 2001.,3
"It measured the discrepancy between census estimates of the total lawfully resident foreign-born population, based on migration records.",3
"It concluded that in April 2001 the total unauthorised migrant population, including failed asylum seekers, living in the UK was approximately 430,000, within a range of 310,000 to 570,000 people.",3
We should note that this estimate does not include the children of unauthorised migrants born in the UK.,3
"This is a really important issue in terms of good race relations and all the other aspects we are talking about In 2009, the London School of Economics published a study commissioned by the Mayor of London that updated the earlier Home Office figures in order to estimate the unauthorised migrant population at the end of 2007.",3
The study produced two estimates—one for the number of irregular migrants and another for the number of irregular residents.,3
"The first figure is comparable with the earlier Home Office estimate, while the second includes the children of unauthorised migrants born in the UK.",3
"The study concluded that at the end of 2007 there were approximately 533,000 irregular migrants living in the UK, within a range of 373,000 and 719,000—so it is getting worse.",3
"Friend the Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell) asked “the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what procedures are in place to ensure that illegal migrants to the UK are returned to their country of origin; and whether people deemed by her Department to be illegal migrants are only able to appeal that decision from their country of origin.” That seems to be a very fair question.",3
"To be fair to the Home Office, I will give the answer provided by the Minister for Immigration: “The Home Office continues to take action at every opportunity to prevent immigration abuse, pursue immigration offenders and increase compliance with immigration law including arresting and returning illegal migrants to their country of origin.” Yet another Immigration Bill is making its way through the House, but I do not think there is any point in passing more Immigration Acts if we are not enforcing the existing ones.",3
"The Minister’s answer continues: “The Immigration Act 2014 simplified the appeals system so that an appeal right only arises where a claim raising fundamental rights is refused, namely asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims.",3
The Home Office has the power to require an appeal to be brought only once an individual has left the UK where the claim is clearly unfounded and where a person liable to deportation makes a human rights claim and it would not cause serious irreversible harm or otherwise breach human rights to require them to appeal from overseas The Immigration Bill seeks to extend the power to require an appeal to be brought from overseas to all human rights claims where an appeal from overseas would not cause serious irreversible harm or otherwise breach human rights.,3
"Similar provisions are set out in the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006” Will the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Refugees explain the deficiencies of the existing Immigration Act 2014 in processing illegal migrants, and how would the new Immigration Bill make any difference?",3
Illegal immigration is an extremely important issue.,2
"On the face of it, this Bill is about discouraging illegal immigration by implementing tougher sanctions against illegal migrants.",3
The Bill would further complicate an already over-complicated immigration system.,3
It would create more obstacles for the authorities trying to remove people and more work for our overstretched police officers and border control people.,2
"Moreover, in many cases it would create huge disincentives for overstayers to depart from the UK voluntarily, and it would lead to inappropriate criminal prosecutions against vulnerable victims of human trafficking and modern slavery Before I go on to talk about the Bill, I want to say for the record that I believe that immigration has greatly benefited the UK.",3
I know how much immigration has contributed positively in my constituency to our cultural and economic vibrancy.,3
"As someone who relies on the NHS, like everybody in this Chamber, I am so grateful for the immigrant doctors, nurses and healthcare workers who have treated me so well over the past couple of years and without whom we simply would not have an NHS.",3
"I believe that the UK should take more refugees fleeing the horrendous war in Syria, especially the children who are so vulnerable and are experiencing conditions that most of us cannot even imagine Having said that, I will start with the central premise of the case the hon.",4
Member for Christchurch put for presenting the Bill: the idea that illegal immigrants can be in the UK with impunity.,3
"For a start, there are a whole number of criminal offences relating to illegal immigration.",2
"It is worth mentioning a few of the existing offences: entering without leave, obtaining leave by deception, remaining beyond the time limited by leave, failing to observe a condition of leave, assisting unlawful immigration, facilitating entry for gain, assisting entry in breach of a deportation or exclusion order, sham marriages and identity document offences.",3
"Gentleman did manage to find someone who had voluntarily and purposefully entered the UK illegally or overstayed illegally, but did not qualify for one of those offences, I say gently that it would not mean that they were able to stay in the UK with impunity.",4
"I genuinely do not have enough facts about the circumstances of that case to offer an opinion, but I am sure the Minister will be able to do that for him Those who are in the UK illegally do face a sanction: deportation.",4
"For those who are desperate to be in the UK, the threat of deportation is a massive threat that hangs over their heads and the heads of their children every day of their lives.",2
"In reality, the Bill would not alter the incentives for those who are considering entering or remaining in the UK illegally I say gently to the hon.",3
"However, I think it might also be harmful, as it would distract from the efforts the authorities are already making in respect of immigration.",3
It has a simplicity that I really wish existed in the immigration system.,3
"As any MP who has dealt with immigration casework knows, the immigration system is not simple What we end up with is a Bill that would not fix the problem.",3
"It would criminalise everyone who does not receive a positive decision that gives them legal authority to be in the UK, but that ain’t how the immigration system works.",3
Numerous people in the UK are awaiting an immigration decision.,3
"For example, a student might fall in love—it is only just past Valentine’s day—get married and apply for a spousal visa.",3
"Alternatively, an asylum seeker might appeal against a refusal of leave to remain.",3
"As drafted, the Bill has complete disregard for due legal process Another major flaw in the proposed legislation is that it creates an offence of strict liability: that is, there is no excuse for being here illegally.",3
"Take, for example, a family on holiday whose flight departs the day before their visa expires.",3
If their flight was delayed because of bad weather—we know that these delays can be protracted; just think of Iceland’s exploding volcano—the family would be in the UK illegally.,3
"Let us imagine that this American lawyer was working for a UK magic circle firm and their employer was responsible for renewing their visa, but forgot to do so.",3
When the lawyer tried to return to the UK from a business meeting in Amsterdam—I am citing a real case—it transpired that they had been in the UK illegally.,3
"They would have committed a criminal offence In some cases, the prosecution would actively detract from efforts to deport an illegal immigrant or an illegal overstayer.",3
"Hundreds of failed asylum seekers return voluntarily every year, either because they have become fed up of living in the shadows in Britain or because the situation in their home country has improved and they are desperate to return home to be reunited with friends and family, and to live in a familiar culture.",3
"The Bill would discourage such people from doing so, because it would mean that they faced prosecution Finally, I turn to a type of prosecution that would be highly inappropriate: the prosecution of human trafficking victims who are brought to the UK against their wishes.",3
It is the case of a woman who entered the country illegally to be married to a man she had met only a few times.,3
She did not come to my surgery because she thought she was a victim of violence or modern-day slavery; she came because she was worried that she would be deported back to her family to be slain.,3
"Regardless of whether an individual is a child or a trafficking victim, under the Bill they would be committing an offence.",3
"In all such cases, criminal prosecution adds nothing to the desired outcome of reducing illegal immigration, about which there is a real issue Under this Government—the Government who all those sponsoring the Bill support—we have seen big cuts to the police and Border Force.",3
"More illegal immigrants have absconded, and fewer have been deported while the backlog of information on cases is not being pursued.",3
"Under this Government the number of illegal overstayers passed the 300,000 mark.",3
"It tells me that, as of December 2015, the figure of overstayers and illegal immigrants in the country is 217,000.",3
"and learned Friend the Solicitor General, but the Bill does raise important issues about migration, and specifically illegal migration I recognise—I think we all do—that legal migrants make an important contribution to our society.",3
It is only right that those who are here illegally and do not have valid leave to be in the country should return home.,2
"I believe we have taken significant steps to strengthen the border immigration system, including in respect of who is allowed to enter the United Kingdom and who is allowed to remain here.",3
"The Prime Minister said, so it must be right—I cannot say it is a good career move, but I will quote him anyway: “That starts with making Britain a less attractive place to come and work illegally…The truth is that it has been too easy to work illegally and to employ illegal workers here.” I commend the intention behind the Bill, but I do not believe that the measures it contains are necessary.",3
Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) used the expression “like a child’s game” to describe what happens now with illegal immigrants.,3
"He gave the impression that it is a sport, whereby people find their way into the country and are not deported or do not face criminal sanctions because they give themselves up.",3
Where would they be deported to?,3
Member for West Ham’s top-flight magic circle lawyer and send illegal migrants back to whatever country they came from.,3
"The truth, however, is that most have no place to be deported to.",2
"I accept that under the Dublin convention they can be deported to the country from which they came, but I think most would accept that that is no answer.",4
"There is no question, however, but that the process for removing people, reducing and restructuring the migrant’s right of appeal and the new powers to investigate suspected sham marriages and civil powers, together with extended powers for information sharing, will make a significant difference The current Immigration Bill is going through the other place at the moment and it builds on the foundations in the 2014 Act.",3
"Its purpose is to tackle illegal immigration by making it harder to live and work in the UK, and it specifically makes working and driving as an illegal immigrant a criminal offence.",3
"I commend the sponsors for its brevity, but because of some provisions relating to criminal offences, it does not support the overall principle claimed for it The Government are clear that the ability to work is the real driver for illegal migrants coming to the UK.",3
I have spoken to many of the Syrian refugees and I know that all they want to do is work.,3
"Member for West Ham argued, illegal working undercuts legitimate business; it undercuts minimum wage legislation; and it breaks all sorts of workplace regulations, for which people have fought here for more than 100 years.",3
I truly believe that illegal migration is bad for people in this country; there is no question about that from an employment point of view.,2
It can deprive British citizens and lawful migrants of jobs that should be theirs.,2
"Friend is right: our policy is not to allow asylum seekers to work until their legal status has been decided, but we have tried to shorten the intervening time.",3
"I should make clear that those who are covered by our humanitarian protection programme are allowed to work with no interregnum, because their status was sorted out when they were given their visas in the first place.",3
"However, I think we would all agree that, whether their applications are successful or not, the period during which asylum seekers do not know where they stand is too long.",3
Given that they are also a burden on the United Kingdom taxpayer because they receive significant assistance from the state—although some might argue that it is not enough—it is in everyone’s interests to ensure that their status is determined very quickly We are taking further steps to limit the factors that draw illegal migrants to the United Kingdom.,3
"That is outrageous, because they are committing a criminal offence We are improving immigration enforcement by imposing tougher conditions on illegal migrants, denying them further access to services including housing and banking, and giving more powers to immigration officers conducting enforcement operations.",3
"We are also creating four new criminal offences to target rogue landlords and agents who deliberately and repeatedly fail to comply with the right to rent scheme, or fail to evict individuals who they know—or have reasonable cause to believe—are disqualified from renting as a result of their immigration status We are dealing with rogue employers, just as we are dealing with rogue landlords and driving by illegal immigrants.",3
"It will be possible, for instance, to close business premises for up to 48 hours when an employer has already incurred a civil penalty, or has been prosecuted for employing illegal workers.",3
We are attacking the infrastructure that currently surrounds illegal immigrants: we are attacking every aspect of their lives that is illegal.,2
"More important, we are attacking those who actually perpetrate the illegality.",2
"For example, the Bill makes illegal working a criminal offence in its own right, because we think that that is sensible.",3
Friend tabled asking the Home Office to produce more recent estimates of the numbers of illegal immigrants.,3
"I was going to answer that question by not answering the question exactly, but by explaining that there are no official estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in the UK because, by definition, the clandestine nature of their presence makes that very hard to estimate So what are we doing about this?",3
Collecting data on those leaving the country will give us a clearer picture of the number of those who enter legally but overstay their visa.,3
"It is perfectly legitimate to discuss that situation in the context of illegal immigrants, but I do not accept that the clauses in the Bill would prevent migrants from gathering in Calais in an attempt to reach the UK.",3
"I accept the fact that people have a perception of this country as El Dorado, but they would not say to themselves, “I can come in illegally and do everything that I want but, oh, I might get a £5,000 fine and six months in prison so I won’t do it.” I do not accept that We are working closely with the French authorities to strengthen security at the French ports, and we are taking firm action to try to reduce the pull factors that make the UK attractive to these illegal immigrants.",4
"However, I agree that getting rid of the incentives and the factors that make people think they can come here illegally and have a sort of permanent life outside the system is a pretty big intention.",3
"I have gone through many of the points in the Bill, including the extra powers that an immigration officer will have The hon.",3
"Perhaps, before these people even get on a train or are deported, we could consider a six-month prison sentence, or a £5,000 fine; I do not know.",3
They will take action where the threats of illegal immigration justify it.,3
"Having seen what happens every night in Calais, I do not think—forgetting the merits of the situation—that putting these people into prison, fining them and saying that they will be deported will prevent them from what they are doing.",3
"None the less, our arrangements with France are beginning to work, and the French authorities have been extremely co-operative In addition to the changes in the laws, we are ramping up the whole of Government’s approach to controlling immigration.",3
My own appointment in relation to Syrian refugees covers three Departments.,3
"I am sure that we would all support greater co-ordination across agencies in Government to ensure that, where we identify illegal working, we extend our enforcement reach and apply the full range of sanctions available against illegal migrants and rogue employers We have shown that we will create additional criminal offences when we perceive there to be a need.",3
"However, I believe that adequate criminal sanctions and removal and deportation powers to deal with illegal migrants are already in place in the existing immigration legislation and the legislation that is going through Parliament.",3
That is where there is a fundamental difference now The Bill proposes a power of deportation.,3
"The deportation would be mandatory, whatever the circumstances, unless the Secretary of State, who, I can assure Members, is pretty busy, intervened to say that deportation was not in the public interest.",3
"I must explain that deportation is a power that is reserved for those who have been convicted of a crime in this country and for those, such as those involved in terrorist cases, whose presence in the country is not considered to be conducive to the public good.",3
"The Immigration Act 1971 sets out the power for the Secretary of State to deport an individual where it is deemed to be conducive to the public good, or where there is a court recommendation for deportation.",3
"The UK Borders Act 2007 further sets out that, subject to exceptions, when a person is sentenced to at least 12 months’ imprisonment the Secretary of State must make a deportation order against the criminal.",3
That means that neither people entering the UK illegally nor those remaining in the country without leave are persons who are liable to deportation.,3
"The Bill would seek to remedy that, but it does not take into account the fact that immigration legislation provides for adequate removal powers for illegal entrants and overstayers without requiring a costly prosecution first, for what are minor offences in the overall scheme of immigration offences.",3
"We have always preferred migrants to depart voluntarily as it is better for the migrant, allowing them to leave on their own terms, and much more cost-effective for the Home Office.",3
"Unless they do something illegal, as my hon.",3
"The Bill would make it clear that the very act of entering this country without authority, often by subterfuge and often after having paid people smugglers large sums of money, would in itself be a criminal act that would merit a deportation, except in the most exceptional circumstances when the Home Secretary determined that it would not be in the public interest.",3
"In the light of today’s debate, I think that promise needs to be rephrased—we should promise that we will, in the future, reduce illegal migration to the tens of thousands.",3
"We already have illegal migration in excess of the tens of thousands—more than 100,000 illegally here.",2
"The Minister does not dispute that, so why do we not concentrate on trying to get rid of those people, because we are a million miles away from ever being able to implement the pledge to reduce all migration, both legal and illegal, to the tens of thousands?",3
"Lady said that my proposals were very bureaucratic, but the people who are here illegally are being exploited and they are vulnerable.",3
"The fact that they could be prosecuted if they are shopped by the people who control them makes them not want to put their heads above the parapet The current levels of illegal immigration are enabling the people traffickers, the exploiters and the pimps to carry on their business, and that is creating a whole underworld of crime.",3
"The Minister puts his arms up, metaphorically, and says, “Well, where are we going to deport them to?” What is absolutely clear is that they do not have the right to be in this country.",3
"As the noble Lord, Lord Green, said, we could go to the extent of Sweden’s position as it operated it, where people could enter the labour market immediately on claiming asylum.",3
"Of course, we all know that Sweden has some of the highest numbers of asylum claimants, so we should not somehow be vilified for claiming that that might be a pull factor when the evidence seems to suggest that the terms and conditions might act in that way Having set out for the benefit of the House the fact that we do not propose to change a position that obtained under the coalition and was introduced by the previous Labour Government, I want to set out the argument for noble Lords to consider First, while awaiting a decision, asylum seekers receive free accommodation and a cash allowance; they have all their living needs met, in terms of utility bills, and have access to education and skills and our health services.",3
This approach also assists genuine refugees.,3
Earlier access to employment risks undermining the asylum system by encouraging unfounded claims from those seeking to use the asylum system as a cover for economic migration The amendment would create further incentives for asylum seekers to choose to try to come here.,3
In Europe we have seen the effect that those policies can have in driving migrant behaviour.,3
"The numbers choosing to live in squalid conditions in Calais, hoping to enter the UK illegally, rather than seeking protection in France, is testament to that fact.",3
"We should not do anything at this stage to encourage more people to risk their lives to undertake dangerous journeys to come across Europe instead of claiming asylum in the first safe country that they reach In the great majority of cases, asylum seekers receive a decision within six months, so we should think carefully about the particular asylum seekers whom the amendment would benefit.",3
That would include those who were themselves responsible for delaying the consideration of their asylum claim.,3
"It would also include those complex cases where there are good reasons, often related to serious crimes, established or alleged to have been committed by the claimant, why a decision on an asylum claim cannot be reached within six months.",3
"Those are the asylum seekers to whom the amendment would accord preferential treatment at the expense of UK residents, including refugees seeking employment here Again, I accept that the arguments in favour of the amendment are well made—not emotive, but clearly touching an emotion.",3
The vast majority of asylum seekers come here to seek our protection and we expedite their assessment.,3
"When they come to this country, they come under our obligations under the refugee convention and the 1951 Act, which says that we must offer protection and humanitarian assistance.",4
"The other argument is that there are also 1.5 million people who currently do not have employment in this country, and it might be argued that somebody could go for a job in a particular location and find that they do not get that job because it is offered to somebody who is here on an asylum basis.",3
"The essential one that I would ask noble Lords to reflect on is that in this Bill we seek to provide a protection of the existing laws governing immigration in this country, recognising that there is a great migration crisis on and many people are seeking to make their way through Europe on this journey.",3
"In theory, the Dublin asylum regulations ensure that EU countries can deport refugees to their first port of entry, as he just re-confirmed.",3
"The Secretary of State recently restated her view “that amending the Dublin regulation is unnecessary and risks undermining a vital tool in managing asylum claims within the EU.”—[Official Report, 2 December 2015; Vol.",3
"Under the existing rules, Britain ostensibly, as the Minister said, has the right to deport asylum seekers to their first port of entry.",3
"However, in practice that means—he gave a figure—that only 1% of asylum seekers from the UK each year have been relocated to the first port of entry, according to Eurostat.",3
"If so, will he explain why the UK is performing so badly under the current regulations In practice, the Dublin agreement is very far from perfect, and the EU is desperate to find ways of evening out the strains from the large numbers of asylum seekers, as well as of not rocking the British boat before our referendum.",3
It is important to know that at this moment These proposals are part of a package to try to manage the surge in migrants and refugees flooding into Europe.,3
"The Commission is in the process of proposing measures revising the terms of the Dublin regulation—namely, imposing a financial penalty of €250,000 for every refugee not taken by a country if another member state experiences a sudden influx.",3
"That is a very fine example of social mobility under the modern government procedures that we have—I should quickly move on The noble Baroness asked how the scheme is working in terms of the detention of illegal migrants, and the serving of penalty notices.",3
The scheme has now been in operation for over a year and has led to the detection of illegal migrants.,3
"The evaluation document that was produced, to which I draw the noble Baroness’s attention, pointed to 37 immigration enforcement visits which took place during that time.",3
"The extension of the scheme across England has worked smoothly, and further illegal migrants have been detected In terms of restrictions that are already in place to access social housing, it is reasonable to expect that migrants who remain here without permission should regularise their position or leave the UK.",3
Successive Governments have sought to ensure that the immigration system is fair.,3
The statement in the evaluation report that just “26 referrals” of irregular migrants were specifically related to the scheme is a partial and selective quotation of the research report.,3
These findings are at odds with the Home Office’s wide-ranging evaluation—specifically the mystery-shopping exercise carried out by independent contractors examining discrimination and documentation issues as one of the mystery-shopping scenarios involved a prospective tenant who did not hold a passport My noble friend Lord Howard asked what would happen if a person moves into a property without the landlord’s knowledge.,3
"I think I have dealt with this already, but the landlord will fall liable for the offence only if they have knowingly let the property to an illegal immigrant and have done so having reasonable cause to believe that the tenant or occupant is a disqualified person, or where they have subsequently become aware that someone disqualified is renting or occupying their property The noble Baroness, Lady Lister, asked a fair question about permission-to-rent guidelines and advised me to write to her on that.",4
"Having set out our criteria, we consider that it should, in most cases, be clear to migrants whether they have a right to rent or are likely to be given permission to rent.",3
"It is not something that we expect people to apply for, but it is open to any migrant to contact the Home Office about their case.",3
"In addition, there are powers to enter and search premises, and to search an individual and a vehicle in order to seize and retain a driving licence if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person has a driving licence and is not lawfully in the UK Noble Lords will recall my concern and the concern of other noble Lords that these provisions were likely to change a dynamic in police/community relations because of something that was abandoned decades ago when the police decided not to be proactive in enforcing immigration law because of the seriously damaging impact it was having on police/community relations.",3
"Clearly, the police will inform immigration authorities if someone who has been arrested for a criminal offence is suspected of being illegally in the UK, so that immigration officers can take the necessary action.",3
"The National Black Police Association says: “The potential impact of this legislation will be an undermining of community cohesion and a stirring up of hatred and suspicion between different racial and religious groups … and will result in the police becoming the whipping boy for the immigration service” Those are not the words of what some people might regard as an out-of-date, out-of-touch former police officer but the views of an organisation representing currently serving police officers I am very grateful to the Minister for meeting with me and other noble Lords, and for writing on these issues.",3
"Secondly, according to the Institute of Race Relations, in 2014: “Black people specifically are 4.2 times as likely as white people to be stopped and searched by the police” It also reports that 86% of stop and searches did not lead to an arrest Does the Minister seriously expect the House to be relaxed about giving the police even more powers to search people and their homes and to arrest people for driving while illegally in the UK because the Home Office will issue guidance and because to discriminate against black and other minority ethnic people would be unlawful under the Equality Act In his letter the Minister goes on to say that, “the police will use the powers contained in clauses 41 and 42 where they have stopped a vehicle for an objective reason” The HMIC survey and the stop-and-search survey suggest that the police are stopping black people driving vehicles and stopping and searching black people for no objective reason—“for a reason other than race and ethnicity” is a more accurate description than “objective” I know from 30 years in the police service that you can do anything to Elvis Presley apart from tread on his blue suede shoes, and you can accuse the police of anything except racism.",3
"All the evidence indicates that the police are not yet ready, despite baby steps in the right direction, to be given more search powers and a power to arrest drivers suspected of being illegally in the UK.",3
"The fact that these powers are focused around immigration means that they are even more likely than general stop-and-search powers to be used disproportionately against the black and minority ethnic community Liberal Democrats want effective border security to prevent illegal immigrants coming into the UK in the first place, effective exit checks so that we know when someone has overstayed their visa, and an effective immigration service that tracks down overstayers and others who are working in the UK illegally.",3
"Restrict the powers to immigration officers if you must, but please do not drag the police back to the bad old days when I was a constable on the beat.",3
I believe that we are of one mind in our intention to ensure that migrants are not prosecuted for this offence where they hold a genuine and reasonable belief that they are in the UK legally.,4
"These amendments introduce a mens rea element so that an illegal migrant will commit the offence of driving while illegally present only if they knew or had reasonable cause to believe they were in the UK illegally This will protect those who genuinely and reasonably believed they were here in the UK lawfully, while ensuring that other migrants cannot seek to avoid prosecution by avoiding contact with the Home Office and/or their legal representatives, in order to establish the necessary doubt as to whether they could reasonably be expected to have known they were required to leave the UK.",3
We do not issue driving licences to illegal migrants and we revoke driving licences held by them.,3
"So far we have revoked some 16,000 UK driving licences held by illegal migrants, but less than 1,000 have been returned, even though it is a criminal offence to retain them.",3
"As these licences hold a value as a form of identification that can help an illegal migrant settle in the UK, it is important that they are removed from circulation.",3
"Clause 41 provides the best opportunity for us to do this when a person is apprehended as an illegal migrant The Government cannot, however, revoke foreign-issued driving licences.",3
"Without Clause 42, illegal migrants would be able to drive on valid, foreign-issued licences without consequence.",3
"This, in turn, facilitates their ability to stay unlawfully in the UK, to look for work and to work illegally.",3
Illegal immigrants should not be driving on our roads.,2
I emphasise that these powers will not be used by the police to stop vehicles simply to check the immigration status of the driver.,3
That is an important distinction between the roles and responsibilities of the police and of immigration enforcement.,2
We will issue guidance to police and immigration officers on the operation of these powers and we will consult publicly on that draft guidance.,3
I was concerned that people who have leave to remain and have been in care are expected to pay the fees as if they were overseas students—as if they were Americans choosing to come to study in Britain.,3
I should make it clear to the House that the Government consider that there is already generous provision for those who have been granted refugee status.,3
"So those who have gone through the process and obtained refugee status can get home fees and access the student support regulations, which means that they can get a loan.",3
But what came through in the reply to my concerns was that local authorities would be prevented from paying the higher education tuition fees of adult migrant care leavers who are not refugees and do not meet the humanitarian criteria.,3
"By preventing this discretion—which is used very sparsely by local authorities—to provide assistance in the few cases where this situation arises, we are blighting the lives of many talented young people I have mentioned before that I am the president of a foundation bearing my name which provides bursaries to very disadvantaged people, including young refugees, young people who have fled humanitarian crises and those who have leave to stay.",3
"He subsequently claimed asylum and was granted limited leave to remain As a looked-after child, Ade received full financial support from Salford.",3
He was not eligible for student finance due to his immigration status but he got the waiver.,3
"He is now applying for British citizenship, as I said I ask the Government to think again because there should be exceptional circumstances in which the very able are given the kind of support that Ade has had.",3
"As I said, he is an incredible young man I want to impress on the Government that care leavers who have had leave to remain, and whose future lies in the United Kingdom, should be able to access student finance and home fees, and should not be expected to pay overseas fees as they are now.",3
"Noble Lords will be aware of the background to the immigration health surcharge, which I set out in the debate on these amendments in Committee There are significant practical difficulties in introducing the incremental payments, proposed by Amendment 79, which would place additional burdens on the Home Office and the NHS.",3
"Around 560,000 migrants are expected to pay the surcharge each year, and many of these may take the opportunity to pay in instalments.",3
"If we were unable to recover unpaid instalments from some migrants, the NHS would suffer a loss of income.",3
I do not think it unreasonable for parents or guardians of a migrant child to bear the responsibility of paying the charge for their child.,4
"The centre gave us a list of cases relating to the visa waiver and made the point that it used to be possible to secure the waiver but that, following some change, it was now more difficult.",3
"There are also exemptions in place, as I have described, for vulnerable children, such as asylum seekers or victims of trafficking, and for victims of domestic violence who apply for limited leave under the destitute domestic violence concession Amendment 81, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, on student support for care leavers, would give student loan access to care leavers with limited leave to enter or remain who have been ordinarily resident in the UK since they were granted that leave.",3
"It would also require that such cases, as well as care leavers with an outstanding asylum claim or immigration application, be charged home rather than international student fees The Government are currently considering their response to the public consultation by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on the terms on which those without settled status and who are not otherwise able to access student support by virtue of our international obligations should be eligible for student support.",3
"The Supreme Court judgment also upheld the Government’s policy of requiring all persons—with the exception of refugees, who are given immediate access to support—to be lawfully resident in the UK for at least three years immediately prior to starting their course We think it is appropriate that there should be some distinction between a person who is a British citizen or who has long residence here or an immigration status of the sort that means they now have a solid connection with the UK—for example, refugee leave, humanitarian protection status or indefinite leave to remain—and a migrant with limited immigration status, or none at all but with an outstanding asylum claim or immigration application, who has not yet established a solid connection of that sort with the UK Turning to the questions that were raised, the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, asked about domestic violence exemptions.",3
"In the first six months since its introduction, the immigration health surcharge collected more than £100 million—I correct my previous comment that it had produced £100 million in a year.",3
These costs are also a significant disincentive to local authorities participating in the voluntary transfer of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children I was asked what the criteria were to qualify for the fee waiver.,3
"The qualification is that an applicant is destitute or would be rendered destitute by payment of the fee because they are unable to pay the fee now or to save the required amount within a reasonable period—which is 12 months, as determined by the rules—and they have no ability to borrow the required amount from friends or family, or that there is no basis for concluding that their financial circumstances are likely to change within that reasonable period, or there are exceptional circumstances relating to their finances In relation to the visa fees, I totally understand the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Doocey, about the very significant increases.",3
"We changed the policy here and introduced a policy based on the belief that the user should pay; in other words, that the resident taxpayer should not be picking up the bill for people who are getting the benefit of coming to this country to study, visit or secure their citizenship.",3
"Therefore, the view was that that should be self-financing and the increases in the fees reflect that imperative I was asked how migrant families could be expected to pay the upfront amount.",3
"It is important that we frame the eligibility criteria for student loan access in a way which takes proper account of immigration status and is fair across all categories, including to the resident population While I might not have gone all the way in addressing all the concerns raised by noble Lords, I hope that with these explanations we have at least moved a little further down the road to addressing some of them and explaining the reasons why we cannot move further in other areas.",3
"Therefore that is where we stand, just as we did in Committee On Amendment 113, from the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, there is undoubtedly a generous spirit behind it in allowing any person who arrived in the United Kingdom as an unaccompanied child to be exempt from deportation once they reach the age of 18.",3
"First, when you examine the figures with regard to the arrival of unaccompanied children who fail to qualify for refugee status, you find that the vast majority are aged 16 or over—16 or 17 years of age.",3
"Consequently, they have not spent the vast proportion of their life in the United Kingdom; indeed, they will have spent very little time in the United Kingdom by the time they reach the age of 18 The difficulty is that the consequence of the amendment would be damaging for the legitimate immigration control which is required in these circumstances and for the deterrence of crime and the protection of the public.",3
"The amendment would prevent the deportation of any foreign national offender—regardless of the severity of the crime they had committed or the risk they posed to the British public—as well as those who would otherwise be liable to deportation simply because they had arrived in the United Kingdom as a minor and claimed asylum We are conscious of our history of offering protection to those in need and, clearly, no Government will seek to return an individual to a country where they face persecution or serious harm.",3
"However, we will deny asylum to those who are not refugees or who have committed serious crimes and are a danger to the public, and will seek to return them as soon as it is safe to do so.",3
"Some unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are genuine refugees and we are clearly committed to protecting them for as long as they need such protection, but a very large number are not.",3
This amendment would take no account of the outcome of an asylum claim nor the criminality committed by an individual.,3
"It could also create a pull factor, encouraging more children to risk their lives on hazardous journeys and play into the hands of people smugglers and traffickers.",3
"Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which it may be appropriate to use this power where a human rights claim made by a child has been refused—for example, where a child is living in the United Kingdom with members of his wider family but his parents remain in his country of origin In respect of trafficking victims, I hope it is reassuring for noble Lords to note that this power will not apply to those who have made an asylum claim, as Clause 59 does not apply to asylum claims.",3
"Where, unusually, a trafficking victim makes a human rights claim, that claim can be certified only where no serious irreversible harm or other breach of human rights will result—namely, where a person will not face harm on return to their country of origin.",3
No negative decision will be made on any human rights claim until the trafficking claim has been determined.,3
"Therefore, any such decision, including any decision to certify, will be informed by the outcome of the trafficking consideration Amendment 114 seeks to prescribe the mechanism by which the best interests of a child must be considered by requiring a wide-ranging assessment of a long list of factors—I will not rehearse them all here—in relation to any child whose human rights may be breached by a decision to certify.",3
"Therefore, the analysis is fact-sensitive This amendment, however, would require the public purse to pay for the return of all individuals subject to certification who are successful on appeal, including foreign national offenders and those who have already received financial assistance to leave the United Kingdom through the facilitated returns scheme.",3
"My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat in the form of a Statement the Answer given by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence to an Urgent Question in another place on the announcement that the Royal Navy will join NATO forces in the interception and return of migrants and refugees in the Mediterranean.",3
"The Statement is as follows: “The scale of the migration challenge requires NATO, the European Union, and other European countries across Europe to work together to address both its symptoms—the constant flow of migrants and the conditions we see them face—and the causes in Syria and beyond.",3
We must also work with local civilian authorities to tackle the gangs that profit from smuggling of migrants.,2
"On 11 February, NATO Defence Ministers took the decision to participate in international efforts better to enable Turkish and Greek coastguards and FRONTEX to intercept the migrant boats and disrupt the smugglers’ business model.",3
"NATO’s Standing Maritime Group 2 arrived in the region within 48 hours of that decision, and has been conducting initial reconnaissance and surveillance of illegal crossings since then The NATO Secretary-General outlined in a statement yesterday evening that discussions between NATO, Turkey and Greece have agreed that NATO vessels can now operate in Greek and Turkish territorial waters.",3
"They will work alongside three Border Force boats – the “VOS Grace”; the cutter “Protector”, which is on its way to the region; and a further Border Force cutter that is expected to start operations later this month.",3
Contributing to the EU and NATO missions to counter smugglers is only part of the Government’s wider approach to tackling the root causes of irregular migration.,3
This includes a new fund of up to £10 million to meet the needs of refugee children in Europe.,3
"Every year, 2,000 women who are seeking asylum in the UK are locked up.",3
"For women who have fled rape, trafficking, imprisonment and torture, detention can be a devastating way to be treated, and many self-harm or attempt suicide.",2
"The noble Lord, Lord Cashman, talked about refugee women and the double disadvantages they often face, looking after their children and fleeing violence My noble friend Lady Northover spoke about the importance of the Government’s analysing the impact of the SDGs in the UK, and how domestically we need to consider what would make life better for women, such as shared parental leave and care costs—all the things that make women’s lives easier and help them to participate, particularly in Parliament and in public life.",3
"To bring it back to the present day, women in this country from migrant or immigrant backgrounds, particularly those who are Muslim, are under an increasing spotlight to do far more.",3
The first whammy is visa policy.,2
"Will this Government, desperate as they are to cut the headline numbers of immigrants to this country, impose restrictions on EU students?",3
"Universities have, of course, tried to get undergraduates excluded from immigration numbers and the public agree: only 25% consider undergraduates to be immigrants.",3
"There is a danger, to put it no higher, that Ministers will think that cutting visas to end student immigration is a very easy way to obtain their immigration targets The second whammy is loans to students.",3
"However, I hope to rely on the fact that the Government are entering a negotiation in which they have to take the predicament of the British university sector seriously, and not treat it, as I hear many Ministers are doing, as if it will all come right on the day or as if we do not need foreign students—a sort of xenophobic or one-island view of what higher education can do in the modern world.",3
"In the longer term, will universities be sure that they can continue to recruit the talented staff they need from all over the world without overly burdensome visa requirements We have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, about the importance of academic mobility, and the noble Lord, Lord Soley, mentioned the burdensome visa requirements that may well be a hindrance to some of those we really want to attract to our country.",3
"Why should the brightest and best scholars and students choose to come to a country which is loath to welcome those in real distress and puts up barriers for genuine students, insisting that they be classified as immigrants and therefore included in the numbers that the Government are intent on reducing?",3
"How can it be encouraging to know that the UK is reluctant to accept you because it wants to accept as few foreigners, including foreign students, as possible in order to meet an imagined ideal number?",3
We urge the Minister to have students removed from immigration figures.,3
"Over the years, we have lost influence within the EU because not enough of our brightest and best opted to work in Brussels, and when they did they were frequently hindered by not having mastery of at least one and preferably more foreign languages.",3
"It also matters to our security because cybercriminals, people traffickers, drugs smugglers and terrorists simply do not respect international borders, and because threats to the territorial integrity of European neighbours such as Ukraine also present threats to this country In addition to prosperity and security, once we leave the EU we will also continue to share wider interests with our European neighbours on issues such as tackling illegal migration and climate change, all mentioned by noble Lords today.",3
With regard to Northern Ireland I would say that the open border for people and business has served us well.,3
It is a high priority for the Government that we do not see a return to the borders of the past.,3
"Last month I was able to reassure the overseas territories at our annual joint ministerial council that we are fully committed to involving territory leaders as we prepare for negotiations to leave the EU, in accordance with their various constitutional relationships with the UK, to ensure that their priorities are taken into account.",3
"At that JMC, Ministers from DExEU and the leaders of the overseas territories agreed a structure for future engagement through the creation of a joint ministerial council on European negotiations.",3
"Our ambition is to create an immigration system that allows us to control numbers and encourage the brightest and best to come to this country, as part of a stable and prosperous future with the EU and our European partners.",3
"However, I also reiterated the case that I made last month at the United Nations for a new global approach to migration based on three fundamental principles: first, ensuring that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach; secondly, improving the way we distinguish between refugees and economic migrants; and thirdly, developing a better overall approach to managing economic migration, which recognises that all countries have the right to control their borders and that all countries must commit to accepting the return of their own nationals when they have no right to remain elsewhere.",3
"This new approach includes working more closely with both source and transit countries, and the Council agreed to do more to help those countries prevent illegal migration and to return migrants who have no right to stay in EU countries On trade, I am determined that as we leave the EU, Britain will be the most passionate, the most consistent and the most convincing advocate of free trade anywhere in the world, so as we look beyond our continent, we will seize the opportunities of Brexit to forge an ambitious and optimistic new role for Britain in the world.",3
"But it will also be a deal that means we are a fully independent, sovereign nation, able to do what sovereign nations do, which means we will, for example, be free to decide for ourselves how we control immigration.",3
"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on Calais The French Government today began the clearance of the migrant camp.",4
"It is the start of a challenging but necessary humanitarian operation and an important step in bringing to an end the difficult situation Our priorities are to keep our border secure, to tackle the criminal gangs that profit from the lives of the vulnerable, and to ensure that those in the camp in need of protection are moved to places of safety.",3
"I also made clear my intention to transfer unaccompanied refugee children from Calais who meet the criteria of the Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act 2016 Since my statement, working in partnership with the French, we have transferred almost 200 children, including more than 60 girls, many of whom had been identified as at high risk of sexual exploitation.",3
"As well as the remaining children with close family in the UK, we will continue to transfer unaccompanied refugee children from Calais under the wider criteria of the Dubs amendment.",3
We will prioritise those likely to be granted refugee status in the UK; we will also prioritise those 12 years old or under; and we will consider those assessed as being at a high risk of sexual exploitation.,3
"However, as more children arrive in the coming weeks we will need to identify further places, and we will work with local authorities over the coming days to ensure that that happens While responsibility for Calais lies with the French Government, the juxtaposed controls are a vital part of the UK’s border security, and are a valuable economic link.",3
"We are clear about our moral responsibility to assist those who are suffering, including by providing support in conflict regions, development work upstream and protection to those who need it The French authorities face a huge challenge over the coming days and weeks to move people out of the camp in Calais, but let me be clear—neither Government is prepared to allow people to continue to live in those conditions, and neither Government is prepared to allow people smugglers to continue to profit from risking the lives of the people there.",3
That agreement has helped us better protect our borders and ensured strong trade links between Britain and France.,3
It is worth noting that the situation in Calais represents everything that is wrong about Europe’s response to the refugee crisis.,3
"The French claimed that, because the migrants said they wanted to go to the UK, they were somehow not their responsibility, whereas we refused, for far too long, to go into the camp and identify those who might have a legal right to come to the UK The men, women and children in the Calais camp were treated by the French and the UK like pawns, but these are real people fleeing war and economic devastation, living in appalling conditions.",3
"In addition, in the absence of any proactive action by either the British or the French, those people were at the mercy of people smugglers and criminal gangs, who were in and out of the camp, as I discovered when I visited the camp in January It was left to charities, church groups and individual volunteers to go across and provide basic support and services in the Calais camp.",3
"I thank the UK staff now working in the camp in difficult and dangerous conditions and I congratulate the local authorities that are providing temporary and permanent support I accept that the Home Office has accelerated the processing of child refugees in recent weeks, but it has known for months that the camp was to close.",3
"If the commentators who are now suggesting that these young people should be treated like cattle and have their teeth tested had made as much noise about the Government’s slowness in processing these child refugees in the first place, we would not be in the situation we are in.",3
"If children go missing this time, the fear must be that they will disappear into the hands of people smugglers and sex traffickers.",3
"Will she note that the Opposition regret that any new children arriving at the Calais camp will not be able to access family reunion and Dubs transfers I am glad to hear that work is being done in Greece and Italy, because Calais is not the only refugee camp.",3
Will there be funding and support for the local authorities that are stepping up to play their part in helping these traumatised child refugees This House knows that from 1999 to 2002 there was a migrant camp near Calais at Sangatte.,3
"The French might be closing this camp now, but there is an urgent need for more co-operation Europe-wide on migration issues and, as the Home Secretary noted, unless we deal with the underlying issues of poverty, civil war and ill-conceived foreign interventions, this will not be the last time that this House has to debate encampments of desperate people in appalling conditions in Calais I am glad that we are moving to help the child refugees.",3
"We will do what we can do for the children, but we need a more considered and Europe-wide strategy to deal with the tragedy of refugees moving across Europe.",3
"And as part of that effort, HMS ‘Echo’ will take over from HMS ‘Enterprise’ in the central Mediterranean early next year I also reiterated the case I made at the United Nations for a global approach to migration based on three fundamental principles: first, ensuring refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach; secondly, improving the way we distinguish between refugees and economic migrants; and thirdly, developing a better overall approach to managing economic migration which recognises that all countries have the right to control their borders and that all countries must commit to accepting the return of their own nationals when they have no right to remain elsewhere This new approach includes working more closely with both source and transit countries, and the Council agreed to do more to help these countries prevent illegal migration and to return migrants who have no right to stay in EU countries Turning to trade, I am determined that as we leave the EU, Britain will be the most passionate, the most consistent and the most convincing advocate of free trade anywhere in the world.",3
"But it will also be a deal that means we are a fully independent, sovereign nation, able to do what sovereign nations do, which means, for example, that we will be free to decide for ourselves how we control immigration.",3
"For us, Europe is about working together to advance our shared prosperity and shared security; it is not about being sucked into some kind of European superstate—not now, not ever The draft texts set out in full the special status accorded to the UK and clearly carve us out of further political integration.",3
"These are protections we could not have if Britain were outside the European Union Fourthly, we want to deal with the pressures of immigration, which have become too great.",2
It includes a new law to overturn a decision by the European Court which has allowed thousands of illegal migrants to marry other EU nationals and acquire the right to stay in our country.,3
"It has been a source of perpetual frustration that we cannot impose our own immigration rules on third-country nationals coming from the European Union, but now, after the hard work of the Home Secretary, we have a proposal to put that right There are also new proposals to reduce the pull factor that our benefits system exerts across Europe by allowing instant access to welfare from the day someone arrives.",3
"Already EU migrants will no longer be able to claim universal credit—the new unemployment benefit— while looking for work, and if those coming from the EU have not found work within six months, they can now be required to leave.",3
"So, when I said I wanted change that is legally binding and irreversible, that is what I have got; and, in key areas, treaty change is envisaged in these documents I believe we are making real progress in all four areas—but the process is far from over.",3
"Instead, we set a dangerous precedent in making illegal the manufacture or supply of anything that can be consumed that alters a person’s mental state, making them happier or more relaxed for example, unless the Government allow it.",3
"Making any activity of a particular kind illegal unless the Government add it to a list of permitted activities is a dangerous path to follow It is time that we treated drug addiction as a medical issue rather than a criminal one, put drug addicts into treatment rather than into prison, and explored the practicalities and consequences of a regulated and controlled drug market.",3
"Rather than having a market driven underground and controlled by criminals, with no safeguards for the chemical composition of the drugs or the people they are sold to, starting with cannabis the Government should take control to ensure that strength and harm are limited and that drugs are sold only to responsible adults Even more worrying is the attitude that this Conservative Government appear to have, or at least condone, towards those living in this country whose origins are overseas.",3
"While dressed up as an attempt to make the UK “a hostile environment” for undocumented migrants, the implications for race relations, police community relations and a culture of xenophobia appear to be being ignored, despite today’s new figures showing significant increases in hate crime—both Islamophobia and race hate crime When we considered what is now the Immigration Act, the noble Baroness, Lady Lawrence of Clarendon, and I opposed the provisions relating to policing.",3
"I was a front-line police officer in the 1980s, and because of deteriorating police-race relations, senior officers took the deliberate decision not to allow officers to proactively enforce immigration law.",3
"In the Immigration Act, police officers are thrust into the forefront of enforcing immigration law with the creation of a new offence of driving while illegally in the UK.",3
"Not only does that new offence have the potential to produce the sort of degradation in police race relations that caused the police to rethink their approach to immigration law in the 1980s, it also has the potential for the law to be used disproportionately against black and other minority ethnic people.",3
"White overstayers from Australia and Canada are unlikely to be stopped and questioned by the police to establish whether they are driving while illegally in the UK Perhaps emboldened by the failure to stop these provisions in the Immigration Act, a failure that was the direct result of the Bill being so bad that we had to ration the votes that we brought against the Government, they now, in the forthcoming Policing and Crime Bill, intend to make it an offence for someone who has been arrested not to state their nationality or to produce a passport within 72 hours, but only if a police officer or an immigration officer suspects they are not a British citizen.",3
"The Bill that we are to expect, we are told, is to, “prevent radicalisation, tackle extremism … and promote community integration” Would that this could be achieved by legislation.",3
"The rapporteur also said that the effect of Prevent, “dividing, stigmatizing and alienating segments of the population”, means that it could end up, “promoting extremism rather than countering it” It was put to me last week that “welcome” is a better way to talk to Muslim and other communities than “prevent”; this from someone who works with migrants and refugees.",3
"On that issue, I appreciate that the Government—and not only the Government—have a formidable task in welcoming refugees.",3
"In the words of a statement by members of the all-party inquiry into the use of immigration detention, of which I was one: “In the weeks and months ahead we will be closely monitoring the implementation and impact of the Government’s reforms … If they are not met, we will push for further legislative changes.",3
"For instance, Lionel Hibbert, a 50-year-old Jamaican criminal who fathered three children by three mothers within four months of one another, claimed he should not be deported because of his right to family life.",3
"Ultimately, the courts have to subscribe to legislation passed by this House to make this absolutely watertight: if someone is convicted and if they are a danger to our society, they can be deported.",3
"We know that there are some 10,000 foreign nationals in custody, and that only about 1,000 recommendations for deportation are made each year.",3
"Should there not be—this is what the Bill is about—a presumption that deportation will be recommended for a wide range of offences that attract a sentence of 12 months or more, as well as for offenders who are illegal immigrants?",3
"Central records should be kept, including biometric information, which should be available to visa-issuing posts overseas to prevent offenders from applying for a visa under a false identity.",3
That is a problem—there is nothing to stop somebody whom we have finally managed to deport from simply changing their identity and coming back We know that the current arrangements for the deportation of foreigners convicted of criminal offences are extremely unsatisfactory.,3
"There are no statistics on the number of deportations that are carried out, and no feedback to the courts.",3
An offender cannot only appeal against a recommendation for a deportation; they can also appeal against a subsequent deportation order.,3
They can claim asylum and appeal against a refusal of asylum.,3
"If someone is convicted, on day one, this should be part of the sentence: “It’s deportation, chum.” Why are we still arguing about it years into someone’s sentence As I have said, there is nothing to stop a deported criminal from returning to Britain under a false identity.",3
"A recommendation for deportation is a matter for the courts, but a decision is for the Home Secretary, who takes into account the circumstances in the offender’s country of origin, humanitarian aspects and considerations of public policy.",3
"That sounds very fair, but what is being done on the ground The offender may appeal to an immigration judge against the Home Secretary’s decision.",3
"There should be a zero-tolerance approach to serious criminal behaviour by foreign nationals, which should involve a presumption that deportation will be recommended for any offence that results in a 12-month prison sentence.",3
"I am sure he would be prepared to withdraw the Bill if the Minister announces today that we are adopting that policy of zero tolerance that involves a presumption that deportation will be recommended in any offence that results in a 12-month sentence That is a moderate proposal—it is the Migration Watch proposal, but my hon.",3
"Until that change is made, the approach I have suggested would mean that magistrates could recommend deportation for a second offence only.",3
"That, too, is a moderate proposal It is currently not possible to make deportation part of the sentence.",3
"The law should be changed to permit that, to reduce the amount of time that foreign prisoners spend in prisons.",3
"It is much better for the welfare of prisoners that those 800 Poles who are currently in our jails, or the 500 Jamaicans or Irish, are sent back to prisons in their countries, particularly when there is a foreign language involved, so that they can be rehabilitated and gradually put back into their own societies.",3
"Again, that is something for the Minister deal with As long as the United Kingdom remains a signatory of the 1951 refugee convention, criminals cannot be denied the option of claiming asylum, even after conviction.",3
"As biometric visas are introduced overseas, visa applicants should be checked against the database.",3
"We should keep biometric information so that we can identify them and stop them coming back Central records should, at the very least, include the immigration status of all those convicted, the number of recommendations for deportation and the number of deportations carried out.",3
"There should also be a presumption that deportation is recommended for certain classes of offences, including drug offences, such as importation and supply but not necessarily possession; manufacture of class A drugs; people-smuggling offences; forgery of travel documents; serious violent and sexual offences; firearms offences; fraud; all offences involving the handling of the international proceeds of crime; and all defined immigration offences On day one, when someone is convicted under the proposals set out in the Bill, and under my suggestions to toughen it up if necessary, deportation proceedings should start immediately.",3
"There should also be an automatic recommendation of deportation for offenders who are illegal immigrants and a presumption of deportation for offenders who are in Britain on a temporary basis, for example for work or study, which was dealt with in the Bill that we discussed last week As we know, the whole question of article 8 is a mess.",3
"So far as those exceptions are in accordance with the law, they include public safety, the economic wellbeing of the country, the prevention of disorder or crime, and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, for instance of law-abiding citizens It is difficult to know how many deportations from the United Kingdom are stopped on appeal due to article 8 arguments, as official figures vary depending on who we ask.",3
"The Courts Service says that in 2010—I am sure there are more up-to-date figures, but maybe these give a good example; I have just got them from the Library—223 people won their appeal against deportation.",3
"The independent chief inspector of the UK Border Agency said that in the same year 425 foreign national prisoners won their appeal against deportation, primarily on the grounds of article 8.",3
"I have 12,000 followers, all of whom hate me, so I am not entirely that the message would get across to my target audience As for how effective we currently are in removing foreign national offenders, the Public Accounts Committee released a report in January 2015 called “Managing and removing foreign nationals” that considered the effectiveness and efficiency of managing foreign offenders in UK prisons.",3
We are dismayed to find so little progress has been made in removing foreign national offenders from the UK.,3
"The public bodies involved are missing too many opportunities to remove foreign national offenders early and are wasting resources, through a combination of a lack of focus on early action at the border and police stations, poor joint working in prisons, and inefficient caseworking in the Home Office.” I will not go through all of the conclusions, but it was a damning report.",3
"We can clearly see that the system is not working When we consider the success rate of the Home Office in removing foreign criminals, we can see that it falls short of its own figures.",3
The number of removals is very low compared with the number of referrals to immigration enforcement.,3
"Of the 5,262 referrals to the immigration enforcement team up to September 2015, only 2,855 people —50%—were removed.",3
"The Department was handed these people on a plate, but only half of them were removed I will not go into the figures for foreign national offenders in prison, because my hon.",3
"They might have submitted an asylum claim, a leave to remain claim or human rights claim.",3
"With an estimated £81 million spent in legal aid costs for foreign national offenders, it is clear that the whole process is not only time-consuming, but very expensive.",3
"In effect, the Government are paying to thwart the Government in deporting people from the country I am not sure whether my hon.",3
"After completing his prison sentence, he challenged deportation on the grounds that he had a right to a family life.",3
"Commenting on the case in 2011, a judge said that it was remarkable that he had not been deported for committing the rape.",3
"Clearly, there are some sensible judges around I raised this very issue with the Home Secretary in 2014, and suggested that, because we are not deporting people, we must ensure that we are tougher at the borders; and that we should take the DNA of foreign nationals who want to enter our country, which I thought was a small price to pay for keeping us safe Another concern is over foreign national offenders who are subject to deportation orders and who are then moved to open prisons—you couldn’t make it up.",3
"A foreign national has committed an offence and the Government clearly want to deport them, but the Ministry of Justice moves them into an open prison, where people can literally just walk out of the gates.",3
"Again, the Government have to do something about the scandal of foreign nationals subject to deportation orders doing that.",3
"In 2013 alone, 190 foreign national offenders absconded from our prisons.",3
These are schoolboy mistakes in keeping tabs on people we want to deport.,3
"In many respects the problem is even more immediate, because my understanding of last week’s negotiations is that Turkish people will be able to enter the EU without visas, so we do not even have to wait until Turkey joins the EU to see that happen, so of course the problem is going to get worse.",3
"When we look at the number of EU foreign nationals in UK prisons since the introduction of free movement, we see that just six countries—the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Poland—account for over half that population.",3
"It states: “That this House notes that the criminal convictions held by EU citizens that are revealed by a Disclosure and Barring Service check are only those held in central records in the UK; is concerned that this does not therefore include convictions held abroad of foreign nationals; further notes that it is not obligatory for an employer to require an employee to provide a certificate of good conduct from their home country; and therefore calls on the Government to introduce and enforce the obligatory disclosure of any previous convictions held by EU and other foreign-born citizens upon application for a job in the UK.” That is a very sensible early-day motion, and it goes to show that the Bill’s provisions, and indeed going a bit further than my hon.",3
"Therefore, if the Labour party could indicate its support for making it easier to deport foreign nationals, that would give the Government some encouragement to make their own provisions when time runs out for this Bill.",3
"1 at the moment is that when somebody comes to passport control, we scan their passport and the computer comes up with all their criminal offences in their home country, so we do not have to let them in if we do not want to.",3
"I would love that system to be in place, but I am afraid it is a work of fiction—it does not exist at all, as I hope the Minister will also be able to confirm I do not want to test the patience of the House—others want to contribute, and there are other matters to be debated today—but I want to make it clear that the Bill is essential; it would certainly command the majority of support among my constituents, and I have indicated that it would also command the support of people on both sides of the House Had we been able to kick people out of the country, and had we had a robust policy of border control so that we could take fingerprints or DNA, that might have helped to prevent the Romanian burglar who left his fingerprints and DNA at many of the 31 homes he burgled from getting away with all those crimes because he was not on any DNA database when he entered the country.",3
"It might also have dealt with the Lithuanian burglar who was released from prison early and deported, only to be found living back in Britain 12 days later, along with his accomplice, who had apparently been deported from the country not once but twice That is what is actually happening in our country day in, day out, week in, week out.",3
We are exposed to dangerous foreign criminals.,2
"We have many unnecessary victims of crime in the UK because we are not controlling our borders and not deporting foreign national offenders, even when we know who they are The Bill could have prevented the Lithuanian convicted of a knife-point robbery before he came to the UK from going on to rape two women shortly after his arrival.",3
I hope we will hear from all parties that they will support provisions to make it easier to deport foreign national offenders to keep us safe.,3
"Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies), who brings to the debate his own inimitable style and has demonstrated once again this morning his expertise on the whole issue of justice and home affairs, particularly the issue of foreign national offenders I thank my hon.",3
"Indeed, we now know that absolutely nothing was agreed in the negotiations to stop the free movement of people, which includes, of course, the free movement of foreign national offenders from within the European Union One reason my hon.",3
Friend promoted the Bill again is the sheer scale of the problem of foreign-born individuals who commit crime in this country.,3
"It is all relative, and the scale of immigration into this country naturally brings with it an increase in the number of foreign national offenders According to figures provided by the House of Commons Library, between January and December 2014 there were approximately 5.3 million people with non-British nationality living in the UK, and a total of 8.3 million people who were born abroad.",3
"It is further estimated that, on top of that, some 25,800 asylum seekers entered the United Kingdom in 2014, and they were part of approximately 632,000 long-term international immigrants who entered during that year.",3
On top of that are all those who are in the country illegally.,2
"For obvious reasons, it is difficult to be precise about the number of illegal immigrants, but there are many of them and, by definition, every single one of them has broken the law, because they have broken the terms of the Immigration Act 1971, as we heard last week on Second Reading of the Illegal Immigrants (Criminal Sanctions) Bill It is, perhaps, not surprising, given the huge number of foreign nationals living in our country, that some of them turn out to be wrong ’uns or bad apples.",3
"Each year, the Metropolitan police alone arrest, on average, 230,000 suspects, of whom 70,000 are foreign nationals.",3
"Only last month, the Daily Mail reported the staggering administrative costs involved in dealing with the arrests of foreign nationals, including the cost of interpreters It reported: “Scotland Yard has arrested 11 people claiming to be from Dahomey—a West African nation which ceased to exist from 1975.” That highlights the importance of checking, on arrest, the actual background of those arrested.",3
"The analysis by the Daily Mail showed that the translation bill worked out at an average of £100 per arrest of every foreign national Figures released following a freedom of information request showed that 227,535 people were arrested by the Metropolitan police in 2014, the latest year for which full figures are available.",3
"That included negotiating with the EU to introduce stronger powers to enable us to deport criminals and stop them coming back, and tougher and longer re-entry bans for all those who abuse free movement I have little doubt that the sentiment of this concise Bill—preventing foreign nationals who commit a crime in the UK from remaining or returning—is supported by the vast majority in this House and of the public.",3
"I believe that we do have provisions firmly in place and that this Government, and the Conservative-led Government in the previous Parliament, deserve credit for the work they did to tighten restrictions and increase resources to let the border police and Home Office do their job Because we are such a generous nation, there are few things more frustrating to the public than when those who come here and abuse our hospitality do not adhere to our laws and waste taxpayers’ money going through our legal system.",3
"Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Craig Whittaker) explained, which prevents deportation of EEA and non-EEA nationals if it would breach a person’s right to private and family life.",3
"It also disregards any idea of individuals being able to rehabilitate themselves, which is something this Government are making positive efforts with in this Parliament As I am sure the Minister will outline, the UK already has provisions for deporting foreign criminals enshrined in law.",3
"They have not always been as strong as they are now, so the previous Government deserve credit for the steps they took to address the problems of deporting foreign criminals who commit a crime in the UK.",3
"Friend the Member for Kettering mentioned, look at simplifying the four definitions of how people can be returned to their country: if they had just one, it might be easier for judges to implement In the Immigration Act 2014, the Government set out that the law should be on the side of the public, and the starting point is the expectation that foreign criminals will be deported.",3
"The Act also rightly changed the law so that, when there is no risk of serious, irreversible harm, foreign criminals can be deported first and have their appeal heard later.",3
"That is on top of the long-standing rules we have in place on deporting foreign nationals, including on the automatic deportation of non-EEA nationals who are convicted in the UK and who receive a single custodial sentence of 12 months or more for one conviction.",3
It is shocking to hear that judges sometimes say they will give only an 11-month sentence so that people do not have to be deported.,3
A non-EEA person who has been deported is already prohibited from entering the UK while the deportation order against them remains in force.,3
"Such strict terms—free from provision for any individual consideration, which our legal system currently has—are a flaw in the Bill We already have in place a tough system to refuse visas or entrance to individuals applying to come to the UK who have a criminal history in the UK or elsewhere.",3
"Under the European directive on freedom of movement, more demanding grounds than previous criminal conviction are required to deport EEA national offenders who have resided in a host member state for over five or 10 years.",3
"I was pleased that the Prime Minister made easing restrictions on deporting EU national offenders part of his renegotiation deal and, in particular, that the Commission agreed to examine the five and 10-year residence thresholds for expulsion The Bill does not acknowledge that the freedom of movement directive contains restrictions.",3
"My understanding is that the problems, costs and frustration caused by foreign national offenders extend as much to people in Scotland as they do to those in the rest of the United Kingdom.",3
"We are privileged that we are able to have control over our own borders as a sovereign nation, and as a sovereign nation we should be able to decide who comes, who stays and who leaves our country if they are not citizens.",2
"In response to the Home Affairs Committee report, “The work of the Immigration Directorates”, the Government state: “Foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them.” The problem is that there may be determination to deport, but there is no ability to do so in many cases.",3
"He is trying to ensure that the people who abuse this country’s hospitality are deported Importantly, the Bill does not discriminate between one type of foreign national and another.",3
Why should we treat citizens of the EU who are not citizens of the United Kingdom more favourably than other foreign nationals?,4
"But the Prime Minister did not achieve the fundamental reform of the European Union that we wanted and, in attempting to achieve it, we supported him so strongly Having failed to achieve that, the only way in which we will be able to regain control over our own borders and ensure that those foreigners who abuse our hospitality are forced to leave this country is by voting to leave the European Union on 23 June or, in any event, by introducing a Bill soon afterwards to make sure that the Government exercise their sovereign power to clean up our prisons and remove from them the foreign nationals who should be serving prison sentences in overseas countries In a sense, the weakness of the Government’s position is summed in their response to the Home Affairs Committee: “We do not routinely provide data relating to specific countries as publishing such data could result in undermining diplomatic relationships with those countries, particularly where they might have less incentive to co-operate with us.” That is the same argument made in relation to those who wish to remain in the European Union—that if we do not do as the remain campaign ask, our European partners might not wish to co-operate with us so much.",3
I think the best way to ensure that EU countries co-operate is to name and shame those that are not taking back the foreign national offenders they should take back under the EU rule of law.,3
"We will then be able, once again, to re-establish our position as an independent, sovereign country—masters of our own destiny, and in control of events—with a democratically elected House of Commons that can decide such issues for itself, without interference from foreign courts.",3
Friend the Member for Kettering that the Government are determined to deal with the problem of foreign national offenders.,3
"We agree that they need to be dealt with and deported as soon and as effectively as possible, but I am afraid that the measures in the Bill do not deliver that The Government are doing a significant amount—I am afraid I do not have time to set out the many things we are already doing—but it might be worth my pointing out some of the new things we are about to do, particularly regarding individuals’ nationalities.",3
Establishing the nationality of individuals at the earliest possible point in the criminal justice process obviously helps to avoid significant delays when the Home Office wishes to deport foreign national offenders and illegal migrants from the UK.,3
"On top of existing measures, we are seeking through the Policing and Crime Bill to amend the UK Borders Act 2007, to introduce a requirement for a suspect foreign national to state their nationality on arrest.",3
"That will help to ensure that the person’s identity is established early on, and that overseas criminal record checks are conducted with the correct country of origin, so that we can properly assess the risks posed to the public by that individual Reducing the number of foreign national offenders is a priority.",3
"Provisional data show that, in the calendar year 2015, we removed 5,602 foreign national offenders from the UK, which is a 6% increase on the previous year and the highest number of removals in a year since records began in 2009.",3
It is worth my making the point that more than half of those removed were European Economic Area foreign national offenders—we are deporting both EEA nationals and non-EEA nationals.,3
"More than 29,000 foreign national offenders have been removed since April 2010.",3
"At this summit we secured widespread agreement across the G20 to resist a retreat to protectionism, including a specific agreement to extend the roll-back of protectionist measures until at least the end of 2018 The G20 also committed to ratify by the end of this year the World Trade Organisation agreement to reduce the costs and burdens of moving goods across borders, and it agreed to do more to encourage firms of all sizes, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises and female-led firms, to take full advantage of global supply chains.",3
"All these steps are important if we are to retain support for free trade and the open economies which are the bedrock of global growth Turning to global security, Britain remains at the heart of the fight against Daesh, and at this summit we discussed the need for robust plans to manage the threat of foreign fighters dispersing from Syria, Iraq and Libya.",3
That means addressing both violent and non-violent extremism and working across borders to tackle radicalisation online.,3
"Turning to the migration crisis, Britain will continue to meet our promises to the poorest in the world, including through humanitarian efforts to support refugees, and we will make further commitments at President Obama’s summit in New York later this month.",3
"But at the G20 I also argued that we cannot shy away from dealing with illegal migration, and I will be returning to this at the UN General Assembly.",3
We need to improve the way we distinguish between refugees and economic migrants.,2
"In doing so, we will be able to get more help to refugees who need it, and retain popular support for doing so.",3
"By reducing the scope for the mass population movements we are seeing today, and at the same time investing to address the underlying drivers of mass migration at source, we can achieve better outcomes for the migrants themselves.",3
"This sickening trade, often using the same criminal networks that facilitate illegal migration, is an affront to our humanity, and I want Britain to be leading a global effort to stamp it out When the British people voted to leave the European Union, they did not vote to leave Europe, to turn inwards, or to walk away from the G20 or any of our international partners around the world.",4
"My Lords, I was delighted to be part of the excellent Home Affairs Sub-Committee, which conducted this inquiry into unaccompanied migrant children.",3
The individual Member States should remain ultimately responsible for meeting the needs of unaccompanied migrant children” I shall return to this issue later.,3
"Much of the evidence we received was disturbing, particularly when we interviewed four young unaccompanied migrants and heard of their experiences.",3
I remain shocked that so many of those articles have been contravened during the migrant crisis.,3
"Children have been left in dangerous situations, vulnerable to smugglers and traffickers A question to the Minister today is: what happens now to these children who travel to the UK?",3
"Our inquiry discussed the issue of guardianship on many occasions and the children’s agencies that we spoke to were unanimous in their support of it I also ask the Minister whether we are ensuring that there are sufficient facilities, such as those for education and health, to cope with the migrant children who will need extra language tuition and extra help with socialising.",3
How will they be helped to integrate?,3
"When we asked one young man from Afghanistan who had entered Britain as an unaccompanied migrant what had helped him to integrate, I was surprised when he answered, “Cricket”.",3
The story illustrates that school and community activities can be good facilitators of integration.,3
"I consider this lack of co-ordination to be a serious flaw in dealing with migrants and, in particular, unaccompanied migrant children.",2
"Our report makes it clear, at paragraph 334, that the, “lack of clear structures for involvement by civil society and international organisations at EU and national level risks further diffusing Member States’ responsibility for unaccompanied migrant children” We heard from witnesses and read reports of children travelling alone, with the threat of trafficking and abuse.",3
"Some, not surprisingly, go missing—Europol estimates the figure to be around 10,000; it is probably higher The committee was concerned that in the current refugee crisis the Commission and member states seemed to have lost sight of unaccompanied migrant children.",3
"I hope, as I am sure do many other noble Lords, that even after we have left the European Union there will be no question of the United Kingdom not playing its full role as part of the family of nations The refugee crisis, which some of us see only through the television and newspapers and via reports from the noble Baroness, Lady Sheehan, and others, is truly heart-breaking.",3
Images of people drowning in the Mediterranean Sea and of bodies of young children being picked out of the ocean or washed up on beaches only bring to the forefront the tragedy unfolding before us It is important to remember that we are focusing here on unaccompanied migrant children.,3
"As the noble Baroness, Lady Prashar, outlined, these are young people under the age of 18 who need particular support and protection to ensure that they do not become the victims of people traffickers, smugglers and other criminal gangs who want to abuse and exploit them The figures for children suspected of having gone missing should be of the greatest alarm to us all.",3
"It is clear that, despite the various agreements, legal acts and court decisions that form the basis of the protection of refugees, especially children in the European Union, as a whole the European Union is fundamentally failing in its obligation under EU and international law.",3
"I accept entirely that this camp is, or was, on French territory and that the UK Government and UK agencies have to work within the parameters set by the French authorities, but the Government must prioritise and work with the French Government to ensure that children are given safe accommodation while their asylum claims are assessed.",3
"I particularly pay tribute to Kent County Council, which has for many years stepped up and delivered when dealing with migrant families and children.",3
"Councillor Paul Carter and his team deserve our thanks for the work they have undertaken over many years The disappearance of unaccompanied migrant children is, as the report highlights, the final consequence of failure by member states, including the United Kingdom, and that should be a matter of grave concern to us all.",3
I also agree with him that all countries should step up and take their fair share of the child refugees.,3
"Our specific obligations, as a member of the UN Security Council and because of our history in the world, need to be addressed The noble Baroness, Lady Janke, made some excellent points about the support and funding these children receive when they are in the UK, the struggle some of them have to access mainstream education and their need for specific healthcare services My noble friend Lady Massey of Darwen spoke, among other things, about the dangers that children face when sleeping rough, the squalid conditions they face when trying to find a place of safety, and the risk they face from people smugglers, criminal gangs and people who want to do them harm.",4
"The daily rates have increased by more than 20% and we have made an additional £60,000 available for each region to co-ordinate its efforts The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, talked about the wider commitment regarding the 20,000 refugees from the Syrian region.",3
"In addition, the UK supports a number of unaccompanied children who arrive directly in the UK through our resettlement schemes and the refugee family reunion visa route As well as bringing children to the UK, we are supporting partners across Europe.",4
The UK has established a £10 million refugee children fund for Europe particularly to support the needs of vulnerable refugee and migrant children arriving in Europe.,3
"However, our overall approach must focus further upstream to reduce the incentives for refugees to put their lives at risk by making perilous journeys to Europe.",3
The Government are fully committed to providing a wide-reaching response to the refugee crisis that protects children Perhaps I may move on to some specific questions from noble Lords.,3
"The statutory arrangements for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are that they are looked after by local authorities, in keeping with the arrangements for all children in the UK A number of points were made by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and I think by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, about whether our children will be treated the same as children who might come into our care from other countries, and vice versa.",3
"Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are provided with a professional social worker and will also have an independent reviewing officer to oversee their care arrangements The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, asked about the latest figures from Calais.",3
"The noble Lords, Lord Judd and Lord McConnell, also asked that question The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, alluded to the fact that the Government committed to publishing a safeguarding strategy by 1 May 2017 which will set out details on how unaccompanied and refugee children arriving in the UK should be safeguarded.",3
We are working hard to overcome a number of challenges including varied lists of children; a number of separated rather than unaccompanied children; nationalities that would not normally qualify for refugee status; and the EU’s relocation scheme that may relocate some of the children.,3
"We support the principle of family reunion, which the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, asked about, but the Government have no plans to change their policy on family reunion because there are several routes for families to be reunited without the need for children to travel to the UK illegally.",3
"We have granted more than 22,000 visas under this policy over the past five years The noble Lord, Lord McConnell, asked about the wider refugee effort.",3
The Act is clear that it must be refugee children.,3
"In responding to the migration crisis, we must remember that not all migrants are refugees In terms of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, the Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement scheme is supporting vulnerable children.",3
"Ahead of the camp clearance, the French authorities gave their assurance that any migrants, including children, would be accommodated and supported if they were willing to claim asylum in France, and more than 5,000 migrants took up that offer.",3
She talked about the UN refugee convention.,3
"As a signatory to the 1951 convention, the UK has a long tradition of providing protection to those who need it most, and we fully consider all asylum claims lodged in the UK The noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, talked about unaccompanied children.",4
"Of course we recognise the plight of, and terrible experiences suffered by, some of those unaccompanied migrant children in Europe, and we continue to work with the Italians and the Greeks to identify them.",3
"The first priority of government is the safety and security of its citizens, and the Government have always made the integrity of the UK border a priority.",3
"We will never compromise on keeping the people of this country safe from terrorism, criminality and illegal immigration My right hon.",3
"At the same time, we will increase capital spending at the border by just over 70%, from £40.1 million in 2015-16 to an estimated £68.3 million in 2016-17.",3
"That means that Border Force spending is, to all intents and purposes, protected compared to 2015-16, with increased capital investment to improve the technology at the border, to improve security and intelligence and to strengthen control Over the next four years, we will invest £130 million in state-of-the-art technology at the border.",3
"Since I became Home Secretary six years ago, we have pursued an ambitious programme of reform at the border to keep this country safe.",3
"Since then, Border Force has transformed its working practices, command and control and leadership, and we have invested in new technology such as e-gates at airports and heartbeat monitors at freight ports to improve security, prevent illegal entry to the UK, benefit passengers and deliver efficiencies At the same time I have worked closely with my French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, to secure the juxtaposed controls in Calais and Coquelles, reduce the number of migrants attempting to reach the United Kingdom, and safeguard UK drivers and hauliers travelling through those ports.",3
"We have developed a robust, intelligence-led approach to organised crime at the border, working closely with the National Crime Agency, which we established in 2012.",3
"We have supported greater collaboration between counter-terrorism police and Border Force, while increasing counter-terrorism budgets to prevent foreign fighters from returning and dangerous terrorists from travelling to the UK These reforms are working.",3
We are disrupting more organised crime at the UK border than ever before.,3
My constituents in Kettering are concerned that we should have the most secure and safest borders possible.,3
"While it is true that many illegal immigrants are stopped in lorries in France and on arrival in Britain, far too many illegal immigrants are still in the backs of lorries when they go down the A14 past Kettering towards the north of England or wherever.",3
"What more can the Home Secretary do to reassure my constituents that we are going to get even tougher on and stop illegal immigration, which also has a security implication?",3
"As I have indicated, we look at the border security at ports regularly to ensure that it is appropriate for the nature of the business those ports are undertaking.",3
"Lady refers to the humanitarian issue of people who may be being smuggled across the border in transporters, and I say to her that the people who are responsible for that issue are the traffickers who put illegal immigrants into those containers.",3
"One practical outworking from the debates on the Lords amendment that will no doubt eventually be agreed to is that the scheme will have a practical reality, with the Home Office official who is now in Calais providing for four family reunion cases to be dealt with per week, so that the process is properly sped up and the care is being provided I praise the Government for not just talking but acting, as they have in relation to the vulnerable persons relocation scheme whereby up to 1,500 vulnerable refugees have been relocated.",3
"It is not just about the numbers; it is about having a proper, integrated scheme that provides properly funded support in this country.",3
"That is what we need for all vulnerable refugees, including the lone children who will now receive extra attention and support This debate and this Bill are not about sending a campaigning message—we have to ensure that they are based on practical reality.",3
"This is not about sending out messages—I do not think they would reach the traffickers or the smugglers, and certainly not the lone children—but about trying to ensure that following the Bill’s passage we are able to provide the appropriate support.",3
My amendments would ensure that the Prime Minister’s announcement last week is fully aligned with the commitment in the press statement on unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.,3
"That is welcome, because otherwise we could be artificially seeking a distinction about child refugees reaching a threshold of being determined as refugees, which would no doubt lead to commitments from countries such as France, Italy or Greece We are making a particular commitment to those who have been registered.",3
The Government’s commitment on asylum-seeking children who come within the current family reunion scheme is aligned to the Lords amendment that will now have the force of law.,3
"My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat in the form of a Statement the Answer given by my right honourable friend James Brokenshire to an Urgent Question in another place on child refugees in Calais.",3
"The Statement is as follows: “Mr Speaker, last Thursday a judge in France ruled that the authorities in Calais could proceed with clearing the tents and makeshift accommodation from the southern section of the migrant camp.",3
"Over the weeks the authorities, working with NGOs, have ensured that the migrants affected by the clearances—which have begun today—were aware of the alternative accommodation that the French state had made available.",3
"For others, this means the recently erected heated containers which can house 1,500 people The French Government have also, with the support of UK funding, established over 100 welcome centres elsewhere in France, where migrants in Calais can find a bed, meals and information about their options.",3
"The joint declaration signed in August last year committed the UK and France to a package of work to improve physical security at the ports, to co-ordinate the law enforcement response, to tackle the criminal gangs involved in people smuggling and to reduce the number of migrants in Calais Both Governments retain a strong focus on protecting those vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation, and have put in place a programme to identify and help potential victims in the camps around Calais.",3
"The UK shares the French Government’s objective of increasing the number of individuals who take up the offer of safe and fully equipped accommodation away from Calais so that they can engage with the French immigration system, including lodging an asylum claim.",3
"Where an asylum claim is lodged by a child with close family connections in the UK, both Governments are committed to ensuring that such a case is prioritised.",3
"The French Government have made huge efforts to provide suitable alternative accommodation for all those who need it, and have made it clear that migrants in Calais in need of protection should claim asylum in France”.",3
Those forced to be migrants more than once are doubly driven.,2
"I would commend the respective Hansard entries as required reading Immigration has become an emotive topic following the EU referendum, but let us not forget that immigration is one of the things that has made Britain great.",3
So I wear the badge of an immigrant with pride.,3
"I have focused on cross-border mergers and acquisitions, raising capital and making investments, frequently connecting emerging markets with western economies.",3
"I am pleased to say that our new Prime Minister Theresa May is building on this strong legacy, and it will be my privilege to accompany her in 10 days’ time to India on her first major planned official visit overseas, at the invitation of my fellow Gujarati, Prime Minister Narendra Modi I am also proud of my background in financial and professional services.",3
Our position is hard won over decades and should not be traded off lightly against misguided fears of immigration The City of London has also been one of the greatest engines of social mobility which our country has ever seen because it is rooted in meritocracy.,3
"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on last week’s European Council, which focused on the migration crisis affecting continental Europe The single biggest cause has of course been the war in Syria and the brutality of the Assad regime, but we have also seen a huge growth in the numbers of people coming to southern Europe from Afghanistan, Pakistan and north Africa, all facilitated by the rapid growth of criminal networks of people smugglers.",4
"There are over 8,000 migrants still arriving in Greece every week, and there are signs that the numbers using the central Mediterranean route are on the rise again.",3
"So far, 10,000 have come this year Of course, because of our special status in the European Union, Britain is not part of the Schengen open border arrangements—and we are not going to be joining.",3
"We have our own border controls, and they apply to everyone trying to enter our country, including EU citizens.",4
"It is in our national interest, however, to help our European partners deal effectively with this enormous and destabilising challenge We have argued for a consistent and clear approach right from the start: ending the conflict in Syria; supporting the refugees in the region; securing Europe’s borders; taking refugees directly from the camps and neighbouring countries but not from Europe; and cracking down on people-smuggling gangs.",3
"This approach, of focusing on the problem upstream, has now been universally accepted in Europe, and at this Council it was taken forwards with a comprehensive plan for the first time As part of the plan, the Council agreed to prevent migrants from leaving Turkey in the first place; to intercept those who do leave, while they are at sea, and to turn back their boats; and to return to Turkey those who make it to Greece.",3
"For the first time, we have a plan that breaks the business model of the people smugglers by breaking the link between getting in a boat and getting settlement in Europe I want to be clear about what Britain is doing, and what we are not doing, as a result of this plan.",3
"Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Mounts Bay and Border Force vessels are already patrolling the Aegean, British asylum experts and interpreters are already working in Greece to help them process individual cases, and at the Council I said that Britain stood ready to do even more to support these efforts.",3
"Our share of the additional money, which will go to helping refugees in Turkey under this agreement, will come from our existing aid budget Let me also be clear about what we are not doing.",3
"First, we are not giving visa-free access for Turks coming to the UK.",4
"Schengen countries are planning to give visa-free access to Turks, but because we are not part of Schengen we are not bound by their decision.",4
"We have made our own decision, which is to maintain our own borders, and we will not be giving that visa-free access Secondly, visa-free access to Schengen countries will not mean a back-door route to Britain.",3
"As the House knows, visa-free access only means the right to visit; it does not mean a right to work or to settle.",3
"For instance, just because British citizens can enjoy visa-free travel for holidays to America, it does not mean they can work, let alone settle there.",3
"Neither will this give Turkish citizens those rights in the EU Thirdly, we will not be taking more refugees as a result of this deal.",3
"We said we would resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees over this Parliament, taking them directly from the camps, and that is what we are doing.",3
"The second scheme was to have a voluntary resettlement scheme for 22,500 from outside the EU, but by the end of last year just 483 refugees had been resettled throughout the 27 countries We said what we would do and we are doing it.",3
"We are fulfilling our moral responsibility as a nation Turning to the central Mediterranean, the EU naval operation we established last summer has had some success, with over 90 vessels destroyed and more than 50 smugglers arrested.",3
"What is desperately needed is a Government in Libya with whom we can work, so that we can co-operate with the Libyan coastguard in Libyan waters to turn back the boats and stop the smugglers there, too.",3
Let me deal with the points that he made in order The refugee crisis that Europe currently faces is the largest since the end of the second world war.,2
"Jordan and Lebanon have accepted a very large number of refugees, as has Turkey.",3
"Among the European countries, Italy and Greece, as border countries, have done far more than anyone else, but Germany and Sweden have taken a very large number of asylum seekers.",3
The statement reads as follows: “Guarantees to scrupulously respect international law are incompatible with the touted return to Turkey of all irregular migrants arriving on the Greek islands as of Sunday.,3
"Turkey is not a safe country for refugees and migrants, and any return process predicated on its being so will be flawed, illegal”, and it goes on to register further concerns.",3
"I ask the Prime Minister to respond carefully to the very reasonable points put by Amnesty International Will the Prime Minister confirm that when Greece receives asylum seekers from Turkey, they will all be interviewed individually?",3
"He must be well aware of the deep concern that many people feel about the recent events in Turkey, particularly the imprisonment of journalists who have attempted to speak out about a number of matters It is clear that the issue of the number of people seeking asylum in Europe is heavily bound up with the wars that have taken place, or continue to take place.",3
"The situation in Libya is equally perilous for many people, especially those in insecure refugee camps The Prime Minister will be well aware that many of those who seek asylum in other countries make the perilous journeys to which I have referred.",3
"They also end up in refugee camps with very limited facilities, despite the great work done by volunteers.",3
"They are all humans, to whom we must reach out the hand of friendship and support I recognise that the British Government have paid a great deal of money through the Department for International Development to support refugees in camps around the world.",4
"However, the Prime Minister still seems to be stuck in the narrative of saying that Britain will accept only 20,000 refugees over the next four years and that they will be taken from camps in the region, not from those facing problems as they get stuck while travelling across Europe.",3
"The question we have to ask today which is germane to this debate—a question to which we urgently need an answer from the Minister, so I hope we get one—is will this same spirit of frivolity, irrationality and self-destructiveness be applied also to our foreign and security policy A very important aspect of security policy that affects the lives or deaths of people in this country concerns our defences against terrorism, which depend fundamentally—not a single professional policeman or member of the security services would not say this—on our co-operation with our EU partners and co-operation between our police forces and the police forces of our EU partners.",3
"Are we going to throw them away for applause at a speech in which we make a xenophobic attack on the EU, immigrants, refugees and other foreigners coming to this country?",3
I listen with horror to statements by the Government that we are now going to adopt a completely new set of foreign policies and that we are going to be much better off dealing with countries outside the EU because we have left the EU.,3
"On the contrary, we are less interesting and less valuable; that is the terrible truth What in the world is the point of setting up a new ministry designed to negotiate foreign trade agreements and starting off the process by destroying 35 foreign trade agreements which we have with about 45 countries as a member of the European Union?",3
When it comes to negotiating foreign trade agreements the Government display extraordinary naivety.,3
"When someone comes along and says “foreign trade agreement”, immediately people think, “Ah, we can sell them something which we could not otherwise sell them”.",3
"But as it became apparent that those two models contradict other Brexit arguments—such as avoiding all payments, escaping regulations and reducing immigration—they have retreated, it seems, to espousing general international trading treaties, whereby our EU exports would face tariff barriers.",3
"This would add between 14% and 70% to our farm export prices, undermining their competitiveness As the Brexit case collapses, many Brexiteers retreat to their core motivator—immigration—and in doing so can trigger extremely dangerous attitudes among a minority of the population of the UK.",3
"Myopic prejudice against foreigners is not just evil; it ignores the question of what would happen to our hospitals and hotels without immigrant staff, and what would happen to the 2 million Brits living in other parts of the EU The European Union has pioneered employee and family rights, particularly the rights of disabled people.",3
How do we control the land border which the UK has with the EU—do we build an iron curtain between the north and south of Ireland?,3
"Europe should be mainstreamed in our politics, not treated as some kind of alien body.",3
"I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Garel-Jones, on the need to rigorously apply subsidiarity and to bring a sensible critique to EU matters It is time that we properly informed and educated our citizens so that they understand the basic mechanics of the EU, which are not in fact that complicated, and are not hoodwinked by, let us call them, untruths coming out of the Brexit camp, such as “We have no control over our borders”—try telling that to passengers arriving at Heathrow Airport—or the confusion between the single market and external trade agreements.",3
"We have seen that with the Brexiteers whipping up fear against Turks, EU migrants, President Obama and now Canadians in the person of the Governor of the Bank of England—in fact, against foreigners in general in a really xenophobic fashion.",3
"The Office for National Statistics, which is responsible for compiling these figures, uses the UN definition of “migrant”, which includes all people who move into the country for a period of 12 months or more, regardless of the purpose or permanence of their stay.",3
"On that basis, all students coming to study in the UK for more than one year are counted as immigrants.",4
"Likewise, all those who leave at the end of their studies are counted as emigrants International students are of very considerable benefit to the United Kingdom.",3
"Indeed, the Government reckon that export earnings from overseas students amount to currently something like £25 billion, and the Autumn Statement suggested an ambition that this should grow by 20% to £30 billion by 2020 There are also longer-term benefits.",3
"First, in so far as the number of students coming to this country from overseas is increasing, we would expect that over that period more would come in than would leave, and that this would be reflected as a rise in net migration.",3
"In pursuit of this target, the Government have been tightening up the regulations on student visas, and many universities are complaining that, far from increasing, the number of new entrants is actually falling.",3
"Indeed, according to the latest figures, there has been a drop of 3% in new entrants for courses and, in particular, the number of students from west Africa and the Indian subcontinent is down The universities are particularly unhappy with the regime of “credibility interviews” instituted by the Home Office since 2012, whereby students, having applied for and received their certificate of acceptance by the universities, and then having to apply for a visa, are further interviewed by Home Office officials, often by Skype, to assess whether they are bona fide students.",3
"There was also a sizeable increase in the number of visa refusals Research by the UK Council for International Student Affairs reveals that Home Office officials are making judgments well beyond the agreed terms of such interviews, often countering the university’s own assessment of academic potential on a seemingly random and inconsistent basis.",3
"But since those who conduct the interviews are not required to keep records of their reasons for turning down a visa, there is, at present, no recourse on these judgments.",3
"The overall result, far from encouraging overseas applicants to apply to our universities, drives them into the arms of our competitors, the USA, Canada and Australia, all of which, like the UK, are seeking to increase applicants from abroad On the face of it, there are two wholly incompatible strands of government policy: on the one hand seeking to increase overseas student numbers and, on the other, seeking all possible ways to cut net migration numbers.",3
"Universities are keen to expand the intake of students from non-EU countries—they bring, as I have said, substantial income both to the university and to local business, and many taught graduate programmes are dependent on recruiting overseas students.",3
"But inevitably, expansion in overseas student numbers increases net migration and results in tighter and tighter controls over the issuing of student visas, with the UK appearing more and more unwelcoming to overseas students.",3
Others besides me have suggested treating students as temporary migrants and separating them from the net migration figures.,3
"In the first place, the ONS is obliged to use the UN definition of migrant.",3
"Secondly, students, even if temporary migrants, use public services and in this sense are in no way different from other migrants.",3
"Thirdly, the International Passenger Survey suggests that many students do not return when their visas expire and are therefore not temporary migrants I will return to the first of those, the UN definition, in a moment, but I will deal briefly with the other two issues.",3
"There are good figures because of visas and university registrations for new entrants, but although attempts are being made to collate exit records, these are as yet in their infancy, which is why reliance has to be placed on the IPS.",3
Even the Oxford-based Migration Observatory concluded that the statistics were unreliable and that the temporariness of international students remains uncertain That brings me to my final point—the UN definition of migrant.,3
The US gets over the problem by issuing two different sets of statistics on net immigration.,3
"The first, issued by the US Census Bureau uses the same UN definition of migrant and, like the UK ONS, measures overall flows of people, including students, in and out of the country on an annual basis.",3
"The second set of statistics, produced for the Department of Homeland Security, makes the distinction between permanent immigrants and those classed as non-immigrant admissions, which includes students alongside tourists, business travellers and those involved in cultural exchanges.",3
"Why cannot this country be more pragmatic like the Americans and use two sets of statistics, thereby complying with the UN requirements in measuring overall migration flows, but having a sensible set of statistics on which to base their net immigration targets?",3
"In the year ending in March 2015, 216,000 student visas were issued—roughly the same number as in the prior year.",3
"But also in that year, 73,000 applications to extend the student visa were made and granted.",3
"Whatever the figure, an integral part of this morphing and transition is that the person becomes an immigrant, not a student, and should therefore be classified as such Noble Lords will have heard me before express my concern at the very rapid rate of increase in the population of this country and the implications for the entire settled population.",3
"Our population is now growing by 1,153 people per day, and of that about half comes from immigration.",2
What gives this debate its edge is that we still have inadequate control over our borders.,2
"I also look forward to the maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Brown, on such an important topic This subject of international students being moved from immigration figures keeps on coming up.",3
Statistics from the International Passenger Survey show a gap between the numbers of immigrants arriving and emigrants returning.,3
What a fine UK headline that would make: bogus student immigrants come to stay.,3
Will the Government consider a post-study work visa?,3
"There seems to be a tension, in that the Home Office planned to increase the amount of cash in the bank that foreign postgraduates must have before they are allowed into this country and insist that they must past tougher language tests, but reports tell me that George Osborne shot down those suggestions.",3
"At this very moment, the country could use an upbeat immigration story and this could be it.",3
"They may not be able to vote for us in this House, but, as I have said here before, we should all be keenly aware that those people are our constituents wherever they were born and whatever passport they hold Those new communities are in many cases home to model citizens; head pupils in schools in Boston are now from a diverse range of communities in a way that they were not in previous years.",3
"Done wrong, immigration, wherever it is from, leads to talk of “them” and “us”; done properly, “them” becomes “us” Boston’s agricultural economy relies on migrant labour from eastern Europe just as in previous centuries it relied on labour from the midlands, Ireland or Portugal.",3
Some Bostonians ask what those add to an historic town that was once a port second only to London Fast forward to 2016 and Boston is called—wrongly in my view—the least integrated town in the country by Policy Exchange.,3
"That report is wrong because it does not measure recent work done on street drinking, rogue landlords, and community integration, but it is talking about a real problem.",3
"I got told that when I went for a job, so I didn’t even get an application form so it won’t be local people.” When we get immigration wrong, we divide our country, we divide our towns and we foster radical parties that bring out the worst in good people.",3
"There is no easy way to encourage integration, especially when predominantly young men work in my constituency’s fields, largely in groups from their own countries, and go out in their precious leisure time with little motivation to integrate.",3
"But if we are to sensibly conclude debates such as this, we should have a care to those concerns just as much as we do to the rights of migrant workers, whether we are speaking of a Briton in Spain or a Lithuanian in Boston.",3
"The G20 also committed to ratify by the end of this year the WTO agreement to reduce the costs and burdens of moving goods across borders, and it agreed to do more to encourage firms of all sizes, in particular SMEs and female-led firms, to take full advantage of global supply chains Britain also continued to press for an ambitious EU trade agenda, including implementing the EU-Canada deal and forging agreements with Japan and America, and we will continue to make these arguments for as long as we are members of the EU.",3
"All these steps are important if we are to retain support for free trade and the open economies which are the bedrock of global growth Turning to global security, Britain remains at the heart of the fight against Daesh and at this summit we discussed the need for robust plans to manage the threat of foreign fighters dispersing from Syria, Iraq and Libya.",3
"That means addressing both violent and non-violent extremism, and working across borders to tackle radicalisation online Turning to the migration crisis, Britain will continue to meet our promises to the poorest in the world, including through humanitarian efforts to support refugees, and we will make further commitments at President Obama’s summit in New York later this month.",3
"At the G20, I argued that we cannot shy away from dealing with illegal migration, and I will be returning to this at the UN General Assembly.",3
We need to improve the way we distinguish between refugees and economic migrants.,2
"This will enable our economies to benefit from controlled economic migration, and in doing so we will be able to get help to refugees who need it, and retain popular support for doing so.",3
"By reducing the scope for the mass population movements we see today, and at the same time investing to address the underlying drivers of mass migration at source, we can achieve better outcomes for the migrants themselves.",3
"This sickening trade, often using the same criminal networks that facilitate illegal migration, is an affront to our humanity and I want Britain leading a global effort to stamp it out When the British people voted to leave the European Union, they did not vote to leave Europe, to turn inwards or to walk away from the G20 or any of our international partners around the world.",4
The House’s achievement includes ensuring that the detail of the important reforms in the labour market and illegal working provide an effective mechanism to enable us to clamp down on those who exploit vulnerable migrants.,3
"It has pressed the Government for the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, to do more to help refugee children, and the Commons yesterday accepted that amendment On detention, the Government recognise the strength of feeling on this issue, the need to ensure that detention is for the shortest period possible and that, in particular, there is proper provision to ensure that those who are vulnerable are detained only when necessary and for the shortest period possible On time limits on detention, while we do not agree that those are appropriate, we have listened to the concerns expressed in this House.",3
"That is an important safeguard, and this House deserves credit for it Amendment 84 places an upper limit on detention for all those who are not being deported of a maximum of 28 days in total, which may be extended by the tribunal only on the basis of exceptional circumstances.",3
"It might be helpful to remind noble Lords that we will seek to detain and enforce the removal of only those migrants with no basis to remain in the UK who are unwilling to depart of their own volition or who are non-compliant As I have stated before, this arbitrary time limit is frankly unworkable and would provide non-compliant migrants with an easy target to aim for in order to secure their release from detention and frustrate their removal.",3
"It would lead to meritless asylum claims being made, meritless judicial reviews being lodged and individuals refusing to co-operate with the documentation process.",3
Mr R’s student visa was curtailed when he failed to enrol at university.,3
Mr M was encountered by the police and subsequently detained after his visa had expired.,3
"Perhaps I may make some general remarks on the clauses, setting out the Government’s position, and then seek to respond to the very legitimate questions raised by noble Lords Clause 17 provides the power for an authorised officer, such as an immigration or police officer, to search people and premises and seize a UK driving licence held by a person not lawfully resident in the UK.",3
It is envisaged that the power will be used primarily by immigration officers as an adjunct to their normal enforcement activities where immigration offenders are apprehended in the community.,3
This represents the best opportunity to remove from circulation UK driving licences which are being used by illegal migrants.,3
"The power contained in the clause will be used by the police only as a part of targeted, intelligence-led policing The Government are clear that this clause will not undermine their work in reforming police stop-and-search powers, nor will it result in random stop and searches being conducted by immigration officials.",3
"Home Office immigration enforcement officers would use the power where they, for example, visit a property or place of employment in response to intelligence received.",3
The arrangements introduced by the Immigration Act 2014 for the revocation of UK driving licences held by illegal immigrants are well established and operating effectively.,3
"As was said in the previous discussion, the Bill creates a new criminal offence where a person, “drives a motor vehicle on a road or other public place at a time when the person is not lawfully resident in the United Kingdom” Of course, this new offence is part of the Government’s objective, as set out so clearly in the Explanatory Notes, of, “making it harder to live and work illegally in the UK”, to encourage those who do not have the appropriate immigration status to “depart voluntarily” and, where they do not do so, to use other measures in the Bill to “support enforced removals”.",3
"As with the new offence of illegal working for employees, however, there appears to be no defence for this new offence in relation to driving.",3
The purpose of our amendment is to seek to provide such a defence for those prosecuted for driving while illegally in the UK if they can show that they had reason to believe that they had the legal right to be here.,3
"Having a criminal record has serious implications for a person under immigration control, as such records can never be spent for immigration and nationality purposes, must always be declared and can form the basis for refusing a person leave, settlement or citizenship During the debate on this issue in the Commons, the Solicitor-General confirmed that effectively there was no defence for this new criminal offence.",3
"The second point made by the Solicitor-General was that, “the Crown Prosecution Service will have guidance to ensure that migrants are not inappropriately prosecuted for this”, new criminal offence.",3
"He went on: “Should a migrant be able to genuinely show that they believed themselves to be legally present, the public interest test … would apply” In other words, as with the offence of illegal working for which there is no defence for those employed, it would be up to the Director of Public Prosecutions rather than Parliament to decide whether there is a defence against an offence for which there is no such provision made in the Bill In the Commons, the Government accepted and recognised the reasons behind this amendment but maintained that it was “very broad”, “very subjective” and would create scenarios in which, “a defendant might claim they had reason to believe they were in the UK legally, simply because they had misunderstood the date on which their leave expired” Yet that is precisely the kind of question that the DPP and Crown Prosecution Service will presumably have to resolve in carrying out the Solicitor-General’s view that if a migrant can genuinely show that they believe themselves to be legally present, the public interest test would apply.",3
"Why then can the courts not be relied on to make appropriate decisions on reasonable belief, as called for in this amendment, and thus put a defence against this new offence in the Bill, debated and agreed by Parliament When the question was raised in the Commons debate about why this new offence was needed at all, since it appeared that the police were not seeking this new power and had not found any gap in their ability to deal with drivers who do not have regular status, the Solicitor-General, replying for the Government, said that there was, “a loophole involving people who are unlawfully here … who are driving with foreign-issued licences”.—[Official Report, Commons, Immigration Bill Committee, 3/11/15; cols.",3
"For my benefit and to get it on the record, could the Minister spell out in detail what the existing problem is in relation to people who are here unlawfully and who drive with foreign-issued licences, as opposed to those here unlawfully but driving with British driving licences or no driving licence at all, and which can be resolved only with the creation of this new offence?",3
Clause 18 provides that all premises and multi-entry warrants can be applied for in Scotland by an immigration officer.,3
Amendment 163 would have the effect of introducing a presumption that ignorance of immigration status provides a defence against conviction.,3
"The overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants will be fully cognisant of their status, having entered the country unlawfully or deliberately overstayed their visa.",3
The requirements imposed by the amendment are open to vague and inconsistent interpretation and may provide a perverse incentive for some migrants to avoid communication with the Home Office and/or their legal representatives in order to establish the necessary doubt as to whether they could “reasonably” be expected to have known they were required to leave the UK Not all those who have entered the UK illegally or attempt to remain illegally in the UK have a history of communication with the Home Office.,3
These are arguably the types of illegal migrant that this legislation is intended to deter.,3
"It would be a bizarre outcome should this group be better protected as a result of this amendment than those who have engaged with the authorities Where a migrant honestly believes that they have lawful status—for example, because they have been misled by a rogue legal adviser—this will be taken into account in considering whether prosecution would be appropriate in the public interest, and clear guidance to that end will be provided.",3
"Should a migrant be able to genuinely evidence that they believed themselves to be legally present, it is highly unlikely that it would be in the public interest to prosecute In light of these points, I hope that the noble Lords, Lord Rosser and Lord Kennedy of Southwark, will feel able to withdraw their amendment.",3
"This would defeat the principal purpose of the clause, which is to prevent illegal immigrants driving on our roads.",3
"I understand that noble Lords may have intended to probe how the legislation will operate where an illegal migrant is apprehended driving a vehicle belonging to someone else, and that vehicle is detained by the police.",3
"The power contained in the clause to apply for an all-premises warrant, which allows any premises occupied or controlled by a specified person to be searched, is consistent with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which applies in England and Wales, and the equivalent order in Northern Ireland The provisions within the clause and within wider immigration legislation specify that the search power may be exercised only to the extent that it is reasonably required.",3
"My Lords, Amendments 176 and 177 seek to address two key issues affecting migrants not covered in the Bill.",3
"Amendment 176 deals with the immigration health surcharge, which came into effect last April.",3
"This requires migrants from non-European economic areas to pay an upfront health charge of £200 a year for each member of the family, including children, when they apply to have a visa renewed or submit an application for leave to remain in the UK.",3
"The charge is designed basically to cover any NHS care that the migrant or their family might need while their application is being processed, but it does not take account of how long each migrant has lived in the UK, their financial situation or whether they have dependent children.",3
"The people involved are largely industrious non-EEA citizens who have lived and worked in the UK for many years, but they face unsurmountable bills when they come to renew their visa.",4
Families unable to pay cannot renew their visa even in circumstances where an extension would be likely to be granted.,3
"So they are faced with a stark choice: they either find the money or they face destitution or deportation A simple, practical solution to this problem would be to allow these migrants to pay the health charge in instalments, rather than upfront.",3
"I urge the Government to consider this, not least because it would cost practically nothing to do it Amendment 177 seeks to extend the categories of migrant exempted from the health charge to cover people who have fled domestic violence, and dependent children.",3
Ruth was originally from Kenya and came to the UK with her husband on a two-year spouse visa.,4
How on earth can she possibly raise the money in order to pay the health charge and application fee that her family need in order to renew her visa Women in these situations are extremely susceptible to exploitation.,3
"Enforcing this charge just strengthens the hand of the abusers, because people—women in particular—feel unable to escape their partner or their situation because of fears of deportation or destitution.",3
"At the moment, asylum seekers, victims of human trafficking and those under humanitarian protection are already, rightly, exempted from the health surcharge.",3
"The amendment would extend that exemption to abused parents and their children In theory, a fee waiver system is available for migrants unable to pay the visa application fee.",3
Many migrants are being denied this waiver despite significant evidence to show that they meet all the criteria; I have many examples that I would be happy to share with the Minister.,3
"On that point, which I was just coming to, migrants making an application for asylum or humanitarian protection, or a claim that their removal from the United Kingdom would be contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, will be exempt under the existing rules A question was asked, very reasonably, about definition.",3
"But some particularly vulnerable children are exempt from the charge—for example, refugees, those looked after by a local authority and victims of human trafficking.",3
The immigration health charge is collected as a direct contribution to the NHS.,3
"I do not necessarily think that this is the place for it, given that this is an immigration Bill, but I will certainly reflect, along with my noble friend the Minister, on what he said.",3
We already share with banks details of illegal migrants who are liable to removal or deportation and have no open application or appeal.,3
"The person’s circumstances, including the risk they pose to the public and their immigration history, will be carefully considered.",3
"The powers set out in Clause 25(6) can be exercised not only when the Secretary of State has made a deportation order in relation to the individual but, as stated in Clause 25(2)(b), when the Secretary of State “intends to make” a deportation order.",3
"The briefing from the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association expresses serious concerns about the new powers to conduct searches for nationality documents, including strip searches, in the light of the concerns expressed about the treatment of vulnerable persons in immigration detention made by the all-party parliamentary groups on refugees and on migrants.",3
"That review was conducted by Stephen Shaw and others On the particular issue of the amendment, if the Government mean to extend the power to include cases where the Secretary of State has fulfilled the procedural requirement to give formal notice of her intention to make a deportation order, this should be in the Bill, rather than the current wording, which is simply, “intends to make, a deportation order” Amendments 186, 187, 188 and 189 relate to the circumstance where a nationality document has been seized but the person is not removed from the United Kingdom.",3
Can the Minister explain in what circumstances a search for a nationality document might produce a document that is not required as part of the process of deporting an individual but should nonetheless be disposed of rather than returned?,3
"For example, the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association reminds us that passports, one of the “nationality documents” listed in the Bill, remain the property of the issuing authority.",3
"My Lords, in moving Amendment 210, in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Hamwee, I shall speak to Amendments 211 to 213 and Amendment 215 Amendment 210 suggests the addition of “reasonably” in the power of the Home Secretary to direct public agencies to supply documents, so that she must “reasonably suspect”, rather than simply “suspect”, that someone may be liable to deportation under new Section 20A(2).",3
"Amendment 212 requires the Secretary of State to return a nationality document that is no longer required to the person who supplied it, as previously debated on Amendment 188 Amendment 213 again queries extending the definition of “nationality document” from “a document showing” the individual’s “identity, nationality or citizenship”, to one that “might establish” the individual’s “identity, nationality or citizenship”, as previously debated on Amendment 189.",3
That is a considerable broadening of the definition Amendment 215 would insert a new clause after Clause 30 relating to complaints and the investigation of serious concerns relating to the conduct of immigration officers.,3
"It suggests that a commission be established to, “make recommendations about the establishment of an independent oversight body”, for immigration officers and other authorised officers, in so far as they exercise powers available to immigration officers.",3
"My understanding is that the Independent Police Complaints Commission currently investigates complaints against immigration officers, but only relating to powers similar to those exercised by the police.",3
Those most likely to come into contact with immigration officers are those seeking asylum and others in a very vulnerable position.,2
The likelihood that such people will have a good understanding overall of their rights and the standard of conduct expected of immigration officers and other authorised officers is far less than among those born in this country or who have lived here for some time.,3
"Indeed, the way they may have been treated by officials in their own country may well be far below the standard expected of immigration officers and other authorised officers in the UK In all the circumstances, it seems that there is at least a question that needs to be examined as to whether the existing arrangements by which long-standing residents of the UK—well-versed in their rights and the conduct expected of officials—can have their concerns about the police and immigration officers investigated are adequate for asylum seekers and those newly arrived in the United Kingdom.",3
"The law as it currently stands is that if a person cannot lawfully be detained under immigration powers—for instance, because there is no prospect of removing her or him within a reasonable period, or at all, or because it is contrary to policy to detain because the person is a victim of torture or trafficking or is seriously mentally ill—that person must be released from immigration detention and cannot be subject to bail because the powers to grant bail and to impose bail conditions can apply only if there is a power lawfully to detain.",3
"It is used in at least three immigration statutes which I have come across, and indeed there is a government amendment using the term.",3
"But if the Government wish to propose an alternative which does not suggest that detention is the norm, and that is accurate and does not carry connotations—in particular, that does not suggest that persons seeking asylum are criminals—I would of course be happy to entertain it I am spending a little time on this issue because it is not just me and the other noble Lords concerned who are nodding.",3
"Article 31 of the 1951 refugee convention expressly protects those who claim asylum from being treated as criminals, and I am advised that the UNHCR and other international guidance recognises that detention must always be the exception—a point I would like to emphasise In the Public Bill Committee in the Commons, the Minister said that the language was chosen deliberately because it is commonly understood by practitioners, but the point, surely, is how it is understood by others.",3
"Anything that risks designating an asylum seeker or someone who is seeking to register his status as an asylum seeker, who is not illegal, as a criminal—instead of, as he often is, as a victim—should be avoided.",3
It is as well to bear that in mind I shall look first at Amendments 215A and 216A on the use of the term “immigration bail”.,3
Let us be clear: no one is seeking to criminalise immigration or to treat immigrants as criminals.,3
It so happens that the term “immigration bail” has come into common parlance in this context.,3
The description “immigration bail” was chosen because it is a well-understood concept.,3
The statutory underpinning for criminal bail and immigration bail are in entirely different pieces of legislation.,3
The naming of immigration bail is not about criminalising people.,3
"The term “temporary admission” could have been chosen, but it is a less accurate way of describing the status as it would not capture, for example, the circumstances of individuals encountered in the UK without leave or those who had leave but are subject to a deportation order.",3
"In these circumstances, we resist the suggestion that “immigration bail”, which is widely understood by those who engage in this debate, should be replaced by “temporary admission”, which is less exact and less accurate as a means of describing the relevant status Amendment 217 is on automatic bail hearings.",3
Individuals detained under immigration powers have unrestricted opportunity to apply to the tribunal for bail at any time.,3
Clearly it would not be possible to detain under immigration powers if the sole consideration was protecting public health and there was no underlying immigration justification for the exercise of the detention power.,3
It is the Government’s policy that there is a presumption of liberty and that immigration detention should be used as a last resort.,3
"Historically, the United Kingdom has been one of the key players in driving the direction of the EU’s common foreign and security policy and its common security and defence policy.",4
"It has given us substantial bargaining power to control and influence the direction of EU thinking in the areas of foreign and defence policy If we are to have the international security and stability that we seek, development, defence and diplomacy have to go together.",3
"While foreign and security policy remain the competence of individual member states, the shared exercise of soft power through the Copenhagen criteria is the biggest benefit the UK derives from EU membership in the sphere of foreign and security policy.",3
"The ability of the EU to respond to threats as they emerge through its common foreign and security policy has been vital—for example, with the sanctions against Russia following the illegal annexation of Crimea, and in securing the nuclear deal with Iran How does the Minister think the Government will be able to maintain the United Kingdom’s influence in the development of the EU’s common foreign and security policy after Britain leaves the EU?",3
"If she believes that the UK will have no influence on this post-Brexit, what assessment have the Government made of the impact this will have on the UK’s broader influence throughout the world and the Government’s ability to pursue their foreign policy objectives In the field of defence, a common security and defence policy gives the UK flexibility to work with EU partners on issues of common interest, such as the highly successful Operation Atalanta mission to tackle piracy in Somalia.",3
"If it is, what plans do the Government have to negotiate an agreement with the EDA, enabling the UK to continue participating in its research and technology projects The EU’s international development assistance helps us to magnify the UK’s presence around the world, allowing us to exert influence on countries which—on current rules—would not qualify for allocations from the UK’s domestic overseas aid budget.",3
How does the Minister envisage such vital global co-operation continuing after Brexit?,3
"What this does not address is the effect it will have on British influence and leadership and the knock-on effects on NATO’s political cohesion and operational effectiveness Of equal concern is that if the EU starts to develop its own distinct foreign and security policies without Britain’s influence, it could put its objectives at odds with those of NATO, the UK and the USA.",3
"How do the Government intend to deal with such risks in future Most of the foreign policy risks faced by the UK will continue to require international action—for example, international terrorism, Russian aggression, climate change and the threats to economies that implies, and cross-border cybercrime.",3
What assessment have they made of the risk of increased border controls and the impact they will have on the economic sustainability of Gibraltar I am sure there will be many more opportunities to seek explanations from the Government as to how they will ensure their negotiating plan for Brexit will protect our foreign policy and security relationships with the EU and enhance them with the rest of the world.,3
"It was an issue that the previous Prime Minister was determined to keep out of the campaign, in spite of efforts by many of us to bring it into the argument, and despite evidence that voters, when asked, responded positively to the reminder Since 23 June, the Prime Minister and other Ministers have said that, in leaving the EU, we are not leaving Europe and that we shall continue to play our full part in European foreign policy and external and internal security co-operation.",3
"The question that this debate and the one that we shall have on Thursday—and no doubt others as well—pose to the Government is: when will they tell us how on earth they intend to manage to play our full part when we leave the established structures of co-operation In the early years of Margaret Thatcher’s Government, Conservative Ministers were enthusiasts for foreign policy co-operation.",3
"I remember the London report that the then Foreign Secretary, the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, commissioned from 1980 to 1981 to investigate how to strengthen foreign policy co-operation.",3
"Those of us who have read Mrs Thatcher’s Bruges speech carefully will remember that that also touched on the need for wider European security, speaking of Prague, Warsaw and Budapest as also being “great European cities” that we had to care about When the Cold War ended, the UK was in the lead on enlargement and in assisting the transformation of east European countries towards democracy and stability and in providing training for their police and border forces and armed forces, as we learnt that the disappearance of the Iron Curtain meant that co-operation on internal security and borders had become essential.",3
"I am told that his first briefing by the official who managed Franco-British co-operation led to the Secretary of State saying, “Ah yes, but I shall want to talk about this as little as possible” I am told that the memorandum to David Cameron on the commemoration of World War I that sparked off a committee on which I still sit included the phrase, “and we must ensure that commemoration does not lend support to the myth that European integration arose out of the conflicts of World Wars I and II”.",3
"Earlier today, I was listening to a senior NATO official who spelt out clearly that, in an era of hybrid warfare, cyberattacks, surges of refugees and migrants and economic and financial sanctions as means of political pressure short of war, the EU is now as central to western security as NATO, and the EU is the essential partner of NATO in meeting these threats and challenges Without having an answer to how we manage continuing co-operation in foreign policy, defence policy and internal security, we shall have no credible foreign policy.",3
My constituents in Kettering are outraged that an illegal immigrant from Sudan who broke into this country by walking through the channel tunnel has this week been awarded asylum and allowed to stay here.,3
This sends an appalling signal to the staff at Eurotunnel and our hard-working border staff both in this country and in France.,3
"Also, it sends a green light to illegal immigrants from across the world that they might as well give it a go because if they make it here, they will get asylum.",3
"My Lords, when the requirements to check immigration status were introduced into what became the last Immigration Act, they were known as the tenant’s right to rent.",3
"However, tonight I will talk also about the landlord’s right to rent in the sense of hurdles to letting, which we see in these regulations and in the Act with provisions that require landlords to be part of our border enforcement It is no secret that the requirements were included in the 2014 Act.",3
I am sure that it was not intended to have such an impact on legal immigrants and British citizens.,3
What he said was: “I have become an immigration officer”.,3
"Indeed, he has become an immigration officer who is liable to civil penalties and who, under the current Bill, will face criminal sanctions.",3
Landlords have to make reasonable inquiries as to the immigration status of all the occupants before letting a property.,4
"There are 25 types of document which may show immigration status, more if there has been a name change.",3
"Last week, the court to which Ryanair successfully appealed against a fine for not spotting forged Greek passports—neither had the Spanish border force, as it happens—said that the way that regime was operated by the Home Office, “offends fairly basic concepts of justice and indeed the rule of law” Landlords are not trained to spot forgeries.",3
"All previous speakers referred to this, but it is so important to reiterate and is the underlying reason behind my noble friend Lady Hamwee’s Motion Let me quote the Prime Minister’s speech on immigration in May 2015: “The Liberal Democrats only wanted us to run a pilot … But now we’ve got a majority, we will roll it out nationwide” This statement contradicted assurances given to Parliament that any decision on a further rollout would take place only after a transparent and public evaluation that would allow Parliament sufficient time to debate, scrutinise and ultimately decide on any further stages of the scheme.",3
"Let us put to one side for the moment the rights and wrongs of those without the necessary documentation being able to rent a home and think of them as people, rather than illegal immigrants.",3
Will the Minister please tell me what will happen to people who cannot evidence their right to a roof over their heads Now let us think of them as illegal immigrants—as though they somehow cease to be human.,3
"I believe that the Government’s view is that creating a hostile environment that will make it difficult for illegal immigrants to have a settled life will, in time, be a deterrent, and that rogue landlords will be put out of business in the process.",3
"They are, first, to deny a roof over the heads of those unable to produce the right papers; secondly, to get landlords to police it by forcing them to take on duties of immigration officers; and thirdly, to make sure that landlords do what is required of them by putting in place more and more draconian penalties if they get it wrong.",3
"However, I believe that the Government are playing with fire here, because creating that hostile environment to act as a deterrent risks enflaming community tensions, as people with foreign-sounding names and foreign accents without the necessary documentation, whether they are here legally or not, will be put to the back of the queue.",3
It will be not only those with foreign characteristics but those vulnerable British people whose circumstances are such that they are unable immediately to produce the paperwork required.,3
"This includes the homeless, victims of domestic violence, victims of modern-day slavery and those caught in the mangles of the Home Office’s systems—something of which I have some knowledge, having handled immigration casework So far I have addressed only one half of the equation—the impact on tenants.",3
Buy-to-let landlords had not bargained on becoming an arm of the UK’s border agency.,3
"Indeed, the recent court case involving Ryanair, cited by my noble friend Lady Hamwee, illustrates perfectly the weakness of the Government’s policy of fining airlines for flying illegal immigrants into Britain.",3
"They will opt for the path of least resistance and let only to tenants who represent the least risk of them falling foul of the law Organisations such as Crisis, Shelter, St Mungo’s Broadway and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants have all documented their concerns on these issues eloquently.",3
"The judge who found in favour of the airline said that its staff could not be expected to spot cleverly forged passports that even trained immigration officers found hard to detect Interesting evidence was given to the committee in the other place by Tony Smith, former director-general of the UK Border Force.",3
"He said that when he was regional director of UKBA, his enforcement teams, “uncovered a significant number of ‘forgery factories’ in London who were manufacturing fake EEA identity cards … mainly being sold to migrants from non EEA countries who were working illegally in the UK.",3
Although these documents would likely be identified as fraudulent at the border”— there is no guarantee— “they are usually sufficient to pass the ‘reasonably apparent’ test to an employer.,3
"The same is likely to apply to the implementation of landlord sanctions” So a former Border Force director says that the number of forgeries in circulation makes it extremely difficult, even for immigration officers.",3
"He wrote: “Although the EU Council has called on all Member States to adopt common designs and security features”, for identity cards for a decade, “not all EEA countries have done so” Of course, the UK does not have a permanent resident card for foreign nationals with indefinite leave to remain, equivalent to the US green card, so there is no one document Even as a Member of the European Parliament, I was dealing with quite a lot of immigration cases, and people would often turn up with a whole batch of letters from the Home Office which apparently attested to their immigration status.",3
To put this onus on landlords is not appropriate I also do not understand what is apparently regarded as the concession of allowing expired biometric residence documents and immigration status documents to be recognised.,3
"It is also the case that, in the mean time, we have had a huge influx of refugees coming into the European Union and a very large number indeed of economic migrants coming into the European Union We have had two very good debates on this subject previously.",3
I am the sole survivor of a Cabinet Committee which persuaded the Heath Government to allow the refugees from Idi Amin into the country.,3
I have always felt rather proud of that because it was a great success and they have integrated very well.,3
"On other issues, I have pointed out that I was concerned about the way in which the British Government in 1939 appropriated the whole of the assets of the Jewish refugees who had arrived here, and it was many years later that I managed to persuade the then Secretary of State, Margaret Beckett, to seek some form of redress.",3
"This has been rather reflected in what has happened in Sweden and Switzerland at present, as far as dealing with refugees’ assets are concerned I start straightaway with a point that I have raised with my noble friend before: it is concerned with the idea of communication.",3
"It came up yesterday in relation to the problems of children and, in particular, those children who are refugees and are related to people in this country.",3
"I have suggested previously that the Government should have a “refugee app” or a website that could provide communication with these groups, because most of them have telephones anyway, particularly the youngsters.",3
"This was something to which my noble friend appeared sympathetic before, so I hope that we can go ahead and do something as far as that is concerned I strongly believe that the attitude taken by the British Government on these problems—in particular, giving very substantial aid to the countries in the Middle East that are suffering from a refugee problem, and allowing in people from those refugee camps rather than accommodating those who have come illegally into the European Union—is right.",3
"But it has meant to some extent that we have been a bit detached from the main thrust of European asylum policy, and therefore, perhaps, have not given the leadership of which the European Union is clearly in desperate need, given the way in which the problems have developed.",3
"My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has certainly been participating in these discussions, but—perhaps also because of our referendum question and so on—we might not have been exercising as much influence as we might have done in other circumstances The problem is that the basic Dublin agreement, as far as the admission of asylum seekers into the European Union is concerned, has simply not worked.",3
"So we have therefore seen this extraordinary flow of refugees from the south of Europe towards the north In particular, we have seen the matter that we discussed yesterday in relation to Calais.",3
I was interested in a BBC news story today that stated: “Many migrants fear they will be required to apply and claim asylum in France and then give up hope of coming to the United Kingdom”.,3
It says in the clearest terms that asylum seekers are not entitled to choose where they will seek asylum.,3
"The whole question of exactly which country they wish to be in is creating big problems, particularly as far as economic migrants are concerned We are in a very different situation from earlier crises, where we had individual asylum seekers or people in particular groups that were being persecuted.",2
"We have seen very violent scenes indeed, so we have some problems that we have not had to cope with on previous occasions I come next to a point that I have raised with my noble friend before: the fact that we have problems relating to people crossing into Europe by sea in traffickers’ boats that are very often unseaworthy.",3
"While we must certainly abide by the law of the sea, at the same time I think that this is a real problem, and is quite inconsistent with the view that the Home Secretary has expressed I am glad to see, therefore, that there seems to be a significant move on the part of the European Union to protect our borders.",3
"We now see, in essence, as a result of the report of the European Council that just came out on 18 February, that the EU is finally—this gives one some hope for the immediate future—taking the view that the deal with Turkey, which has gradually been established, will enable it to prevent people carrying out the extremely hazardous and very short sea journey, and actually patrol the borders.",3
"That has not been happening yet, but the report of the Council’s conclusions on migration on 18 February, and a subsequent one a couple of days later, gives one hope that this is indeed a moment when we can see some serious concern to patrol and re-establish the borders It is clearly an impossible situation when we have the Schengen agreement on the one hand and porous external borders at the same time.",3
"I very much hope that our Government, despite the inhibitions that I mentioned earlier, will encourage it to do so and ensure that serious action is taken to admit genuine asylum seekers—which most certainly should be our policy, not least as far as two of them are concerned—and at the same time distinguish them very clearly from economic migrants.",3
"We ought to take a very different line with them and ensure that they do not obtain entry to this country, to some extent at the expense of the genuine asylum seekers.",3
"However, nobody could fail to be moved by the sight of refugees coming from Syria, Iraq and Libya or the sight of people, including children, drowning in the Mediterranean; nor could anybody fail to be moved, at least intellectually, by the sheer numbers of people who are moving.",3
"However, the sheer scale of the refugee flows that are affecting Greece is as nothing compared with what is going on in countries such as Jordan and Lebanon.",3
Western Europe has been remarkably unaffected by refugee flows over recent decades.,3
We have not been affected by huge numbers of refugees coming to our borders.,3
"We have agreed to take 20,000 Syrians from the camps but we are not on a daily basis accepting coachloads or boatloads of would-be refugees.",3
The fact that we are not part of the Schengen area means that in many ways we feel we are protecting our own borders and leave it to other member states to protect their own.,4
"However, those borders are porous and there are questions about documents—which comes into the formal Question—and how far those held by people seeking asylum are verifiable.",3
"That is a hugely important area that affects British security as well as security in the rest of the European Union Last week, the Home Secretary talked about the importance of securing European borders but she also made very clear that the United Kingdom still did not see a need to be part of a European coastguard initiative, and that somehow the United Kingdom still feels that we are separate from that.",3
"Does the Minister not think that it would be beneficial for the United Kingdom to be more engaged, supporting countries such as Greece to man European borders?",3
Those borders are not simply ones for other countries.,2
The nature of the Schengen area may be one that we have decided is not for the United Kingdom but there is always the danger that people who come through the European Union from porous borders are not properly documented.,3
Are we sure that we are able to scrutinise and filter out everybody who should not be here because they are coming for illegal terrorist purposes?,3
"How are we also scrutinising to find out whether people are genuine asylum seekers whom we should welcome, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, suggested?",3
"How far are we working with European partners to say, “Some of these people should not be coming”, even with the very generous opportunities offered by Angela Merkel in Germany who said, “Any Syrian refugees can come”?",3
Would it not be beneficial for us to work more closely with our European partners to ensure that we focus on working effectively to facilitate the reception of genuine asylum seekers and to keep out those who should not be here?,3
The European Commission has put forward a very comprehensive package of measures on borders and migration.,3
Yesterday we saw terrible scenes of tear gas being fired at migrants on the Macedonian border.,3
"It is obvious that we need to do a number of things, of which the following is a non-exhaustive list of six The EU’s external border must be strengthened.",3
"It is welcome that the Council is urgently examining the Commission’s proposal for a European border and coastguard agency, which I assume that the UK cannot be associated with.",3
We need a much greater push to put smugglers and traffickers out of business and into jail if at all possible.,2
I believe 900 people have been apprehended by FRONTEX working with Europol and Eurojust The EU must also ensure that security threats from potential terrorists are combated by stopping them slipping in as migrants.,3
"The Council has agreed a common position on the proposal for checks against databases at external borders but, again, as it is a Schengen project, I assume the UK cannot take part.",3
"Will the UK use the Interpol database and its access for policing purposes to the Schengen information system to align our practices on Schengen and seek maximum co-operation with the Schengen zone on this checking process I note that the Home Secretary said last week, in a Written Statement that she would, “push for Schengen and non-Schengen states to be able to exchange immigration information”.—[Official Report, Commons, 24/2/16; col. 11WS] As the UK does not have access to the immigration side of the Schengen information system, will the Minister explain what such an exchange might consist of We must secure safe and legal routes for refugees and asylum seekers to reach Europe.",3
"Decisions on who needs protection must be made promptly so that they can work and integrate as speedily as possible, and those who do not have legitimate claims to stay must be returned.",3
This is essential to preserve the integrity of the refugee system and public support for it I recognise that the Government are offering practical assistance to help with the registering and fingerprinting of migrants in Greece and Italy.,3
"Obviously, it is timely in the light of the current situation both on the Macedonian border with Greece and at our end of Europe in Calais and Dunkirk In its very recent report on a more effective EU foreign and security strategy, the European Union Committee said: “Migrant and refugee inflows are likely to remain a long-term challenge for the Union.",3
"These internal divisions are likely to undermine Member States’ ability to achieve unity on foreign policy issues” The issues covered by this debate are ones that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has raised on a number of occasions before.",3
"Indeed, he did so last month when he asked in a Written Question whether, “EU member states within the Schengen area are issuing a standard form of passport or other document to those they accept as asylum seekers or whether individual countries decide on the format to use” I think that the Answer the noble Lord received was that EU member states were actually issuing, “a refugee status travel document, in the form set out in the Schedule to the Geneva Convention”, rather than that that was what member states ought to be doing but whether they all were was another matter.",3
"Perhaps the Minister could clarify this point in his reply The European Council meeting last month stated that the objective of the EU had to be, “to rapidly stem the flows, protect our external borders, reduce illegal migration and safeguard the integrity of the Schengen area” With that last point in mind, the European Council said that there was a need to, “get back to a situation where all Members of the Schengen Area fully apply the Schengen Borders Code and refuse entry at external borders to third-country nationals who do not satisfy the entry conditions or who have not made an asylum application despite having had the opportunity to do so” Reference has already been made in this debate to the intentions of an EU agreement with Turkey The European Council expressed the view that, “with the help of the EU, the setting up and functioning of hotspots”, in front-line member states to ensure effective reception and registration processes was, “gradually improving as regards identification, registration, fingerprinting and security checks on persons and travel documents”, although much remained to be done.",3
"What remained to be done included, “to fully implement the relocation process, to stem secondary flows of irregular migrants and asylum-seekers and to provide the significant reception facilities needed to accommodate migrants under humane conditions while their situation is being clarified” The Council reiterated, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, said: “Asylum seekers do not have the right to choose the Member State in which they seek asylum” According to the third quarterly report for last year from the Frontex Risk Analysis Network, that quarter saw the highest ever reported numbers of illegal border crossings since data collection began in 2007, with the figure being not far short of 620,000.",3
"Most illegal border crossings—almost 320,000—were reported on the eastern Mediterranean route, with almost all accounted-for detections being on the eastern Aegean islands.",3
"Around 70% of the irregular migrants on this route claimed to be of Syrian nationality, with some 17% saying they were of Afghan nationality In the third quarter of 2015, the number of detected undocumented Syrian nationals within the EU, at almost 90,000, more than tripled compared to the previous quarter, and there were significant increases in the number of illegal stayers from Bangladesh, Iran and Iraq.",3
"Also during the third quarter of last year, EU member states reported more than 405,000 asylum applications—an almost 150% increase on the same period in 2014.",3
"Almost two-thirds submitted their application in the top three countries—Germany, Hungary and Sweden—although apparently most asylum seekers in Hungary absconded to apply for asylum in another country.",3
"The figures also showed that Syrians were the top-ranking asylum nationality in the EU Schengen area, with more than 137,000 applications in the third quarter of last year, followed by Afghan, Iraqi and Albanian nationals As a result of the increasing number of migrants arriving in the EU, several Schengen member states have introduced or reintroduced temporary border controls at their borders with other Schengen member states.",3
"At the end of last year the European Commission proposed establishing a European border and coast guard, with a view to ensuring a strong, shared management of external borders.",3
The Commission also proposed to introduce systematic checks against relevant databases for all people entering or exiting the Schengen area The subject matter of this debate refers to an assessment of the security of the European Union’s borders.,3
It is clear that the EU’s borders are not secure and probably cannot be secure in the face of the large-scale migration arising mainly from the current and continuing conflicts in the Middle East.,2
"However, our own borders are not secure either in the sense that we do not have much control over the numbers of people coming to this country.",2
"The lack of response from the Government when asked to give even an estimate of the level of net migration for this year and next year is eloquent testimony to that lack of control At times there also appears to be a certain lack of enthusiasm on the Government’s part for engaging with EU member states, particularly on migration and border control issues.",3
"Interestingly, the subject matter of this debate also asks what discussions the Government have had with the Governments of other EU member states about the documentation of those individuals they accept as refugees.",3
"Relevant and appropriate though that question is, and relevant and appropriate though the measures the EU wants to take to try to secure its borders may be, the only real solution to the present situation is to address the causes of the large-scale migration currently taking place—and that will require a mutual determination to do so on the part of the major powers, including the EU, which currently seems to be lacking.",3
"The debate that we have had around these issues has been of great value, and I hope to add to it with some responses to the legitimate questions that have been raised The UK Government recognise the importance of this issue and are committed to supporting our European partners to ensure the full and proper management of the EU’s external border, reduce the impact of illegal migration and deter people from risking their lives on perilous journeys, as well as to increase security at the border.",3
"The scale is quite shocking It is important to clarify that although the UK is not part of Schengen or a member of FRONTEX, we want to support the operational work of the proposed EU border agency, in the same way that we currently support FRONTEX operations.",3
"The British Government were represented at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 25 and 26 January, at an informal strategic committee on immigration, frontiers and asylum in Europe on 15 and 16 January, and at the European Council on 18 and 19 February.",3
"At the end of the month, there is the UNHCR meeting on Syrian refugees That is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but I read it out to stress that, from my experience of working in the Home Office, my colleagues in the department are actively engaged in this on a daily basis.",3
"That is why the UK is taking a comprehensive approach to the migrant crisis, intervening at every stage of the migrant journey—at source, in transit, at the EU’s frontier, at our border and in the UK.",3
We want to help build stability in the countries these migrants come from and we are engaging in the largest-ever humanitarian response to a single crisis.,3
"We have exceeded our commitment to resettle 1,000 Syrian refugees before Christmas, and expect to resettle up to the full commitment of 20,000 Syrians by 2020 In relation to the external border, the UK is playing a part in the maritime operations.",3
"As my noble friend Lord Smith urged, the EU needs to be firm with those who do not need protection, pose a security risk or refuse to co-operate with the asylum process With regard to the Government’s approach to European Commission initiatives, the Government fully support the Commission’s hotspots proposal, which aims to address these issues at the border.",3
In our view the hotspots can contribute to better management of the EU’s external border by securing the rapid return of those without a legitimate asylum claim.,3
Europol last week estimated that of those arriving in the European Union in search of asylum 90% had paid a criminal gang to get here.,3
"Since last year, UK law enforcement has disrupted more than 170 organised crime groups involved in organised immigration crime.",3
"Since April 2015 immigration enforcement has disrupted 94 organised crime groups involved in organising immigration crime, 12 of which involved people smuggling.",3
"To give one example, however, one group that was disrupted in December involved 23 people from Sweden, Austria, the UK and Greece, and was responsible for bringing 100 migrants a day into Greece.",3
We can then ensure that our borders are secure.,3
The UK Government have committed £250 million to securing that crucial southern border to the region to tackle that issue.,3
"Indeed, that is why we have so many migrants, who have contributed to the dynamism in every aspect of UK life.",3
"There has been some slow reversal of that through local enterprise boards, but the money available to them is much less and they do not have the role of enabling small enterprises to work beneficially with the EU on industrial R&D projects The House of Lords committee also benefited from the advice of Siemens, a leading example of the many foreign high-tech companies that have invested in and set up branches in the UK.",3
"Although some economists say that it does not matter whether industries in this country are owned by UK or foreign companies, according to the Financial Times and many other commentators—starting of course with Lord Macmillan when he was here in the Lords—there are serious limitations in allowing everything essentially to be sold off.",3
"It is clear that where there are foreign owners, the strategic R&D work is often done in the countries where the companies are based, and we have seen the effects of this in some aspects of aviation, trains, steel and so on.",3
The financial benefits of UK government investment in research often simply lead to the benefit of these companies in their foreign-based headquarters and overseas share holders.,3
"As I said, the Financial Times laughed at the French because they had to have a French yoghurt industry, but it has now withdrawn from that point of view If companies are foreign owned, will HMG do more to improve networking and combined technologies for advanced industries?",3
The future integration and collaboration between industry and government is likely to be much more conceptually advanced than at present.,3
"In an extraordinarily integrated way the software looks not just at one company or one product, but at how different companies can work into projects.",3
"This is far beyond anything we can see at the moment, but perhaps the Government’s catapult programme will begin to develop the kind of integrated approach adopted by the German Government, which was described last week at the German embassy.",3
But there is no question that it would be more effective and more likely to be accepted if there was a closer integration between the military project and civilian ship construction.,3
My concern that we are alienating large sections of the electorate and playing into the hands of the far right is not simply about the Conservative party.,3
"I despair when I hear Labour spokespeople responding to questions about immigration with meaningless platitudes such as, “We need to talk about immigration,” or when I listen to Front Benchers who dismiss or deny voters’ legitimate concerns.",3
"We need a credible policy agenda that does not compromise our internationalist and anti-racist values, but recognises that if people do not believe in open borders, they must show how they will control and manage immigration It is entirely consistent to have zero tolerance for the demonisation of immigrants, while believing in the control and management of migration.",3
It is also consistent to assert that integration is an expectation of citizenship and to be crystal clear that it is this country’s duty and in our finest traditions to be a safe haven for refugees fleeing violence and repression.,3
"It is a personal, unresolved story and I shall use my time to tell it Mr Affonso was born in Tanzania, has lived in this country for more than 30 years, is married to a British national and has had protracted concerns over the status of his citizenship, which are, as yet, not satisfactorily resolved.",4
I believe there are other cases of British nationals with spouses from overseas who have been seeking British citizenship for many years and perhaps do not fit into the conventional mould of immigration cases Michael Affonso was born in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania in 1969.,4
"He recalled a birth certificate and a Tanzanian passport, but while living in Kettering, many years before the move to Wales, a fire at his flat had destroyed any paperwork, including his passport.",3
"We made inquiries of Nottinghamshire social services to find out whether anything had been done, or not done, about citizenship under their care.",3
We spoke to the Tanzanian embassy to inquire about his passport.,3
"Of course, he had not been away because he had no passport, although for someone who was unaware of that stipulation it was very difficult to prove.",3
The couple really thought they were on the cusp of securing British citizenship for Michael.,3
"Despite the gathering of what documentation they had, including at long last a notice of care proceedings when he had been removed from his biological mother’s care, they were told that because he himself had no proof of entering the country, he was in fact an illegal immigrant.",3
"They were offered an alternative to the full naturalisation process: Michael would have to reapply for leave to remain every two and a half years—the next occasion being in 2017—at a cost of £500 each time, until he had 10 years’ worth of visas.",3
"After 10 years, in 2024, he might be entitled to apply for British citizenship.",3
"The Home Office to date has been reluctant to look into this matter in great depth and seems intent on sticking by its original decision that Mr Affonso may have to wait until 2024 to achieve full citizenship Much of the debate on immigration these days is, not unreasonably, about people needing to come to this country.",3
"He came here as a minor, and the various agencies that were charged with his care did not address the issue of citizenship.",3
"The Government have always made the integrity of the UK border a priority and we will never compromise on keeping the people of this country safe from terrorism, criminality and illegal immigration My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will publish the Treasury main supply estimates in just over an hour’s time, setting out estimated budget allocations for the whole of government, including Border Force, for the 2016-17 financial year.",3
"At the same time, we will increase capital spending at the border by just over 70%, from £40.1 million in 2015-16 to an estimated £68.3 million in 2016-17 This means that Border Force spending is to all intents and purposes protected compared with 2015-16, with increased capital investment to improve the technology at the border to improve security and intelligence and strengthen control.",3
"Over the next four years, we will invest £130 million in state-of-the-art technology at the border Since I became Home Secretary six years ago, we have pursued an ambitious programme of reform at the border to keep this country safe.",3
"We have invested in new technology like e-gates at airports and heartbeat monitors at freight ports to improve security, prevent illegal entry to the UK, benefit passengers and deliver efficiencies At the same time, I have worked closely with my French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, to secure the juxtaposed controls in Calais and Coquelles, reduce the number of migrants attempting to reach the UK, and safeguard UK drivers and hauliers travelling through those ports.",3
"We have developed a robust, intelligence-led approach to organised crime at the border, working closely with the National Crime Agency we established in 2012.",3
"We have supported greater collaboration between counterterrorism police and Border Force, while increasing counterterrorism budgets to prevent foreign fighters returning and dangerous terrorists travelling to the UK These reforms are working.",3
We are also disrupting more organised crime at the UK border than ever before.,3
"My Lords, as we have heard, this group of amendments relates to the provisions in Clauses 144 and 145, which confer powers on police and immigration officers to require a suspected foreign national to state their nationality after arrest and to produce nationality documents where required.",3
"The noble Baroness has tabled a number of amendments of her own, designed to push the Government a little further, but before I respond to these I shall explain the government amendments Amendment 180 concerns the situation where a UK national does not possess a passport and is otherwise suspected to be a foreign national.",3
"As recommended by the JCHR, this amendment clarifies that officers are able to take into account alternative documentary evidence which would establish an arrested person’s entitlement to a British passport.",3
"Moreover, in respect of the offences in these clauses there is, in each case, a reasonable excuse defence Finally, Amendment 181BA seeks to provide for a post-legislative review of not just the provisions in Clauses 144 and 145 but also the powers conferred by the Immigration Act 2016 to search for and seize driving licences held by an illegal migrant.",3
My noble friend also committed to issuing guidance to police and immigration officers on the operation of these powers and to a public consultation on that draft guidance before implementation.,3
"Such bigotry was alien to these who endured it, even when the home of a well-known GP, David Pitt—who later became a Member of your Lordships’ House as Lord Pitt of Hampstead—was burned down.",3
"Lord Constantine was also abused by some, even though he was admired for his cricketing prowess Most of those people were willing to keep their heads down but others saw that the insults could not be tolerated when English men and women took to the streets to show how passionately they felt, feeding fears that this country would be taken over by immigrants.",3
I arrived in Britain in 1951 as a student and I saw immigration.,4
"Omar Khan, director of the Runnymede Trust, says that it is time we stopped telling young people from different ethnic backgrounds that all they need to do is get better qualifications and integrate more and all will be fine Sadly, that is not true.",3
"My Lords, I shall also speak to my Motion D It is clear that both the Government and noble Lords who supported this House’s amendment in respect of a time limit on immigration detention have a common purpose—to prevent the detention of individuals for any longer than is absolutely necessary.",3
"This reflects the seriousness with which the Government regard these issues The Government have made clear previously their rationale for opposing general time limits on immigration detention—that they would be arbitrary, that they would not take account of individual circumstances, and that they would encourage individuals to seek to frustrate the removals process until the time limit is reached.",3
"I fully respect the views of those noble Lords who voted in favour of a time limit but the Government’s strong view remains that a time limit would have a negative impact on their ability to enforce immigration control and, consequently, to maintain public safety However, the Government have considered the views expressed by many noble Lords that there should be a greater level of judicial oversight over detention.",3
They will be made aware of and have access to legal advice to support them in making challenges to immigration detention and in making applications for bail.,3
"Together with other reforms—the gatekeeper role, the adults at risk policy and the new casework management system with frequent internal reviews—this amendment will provide adequate oversight of detention Amendment 85A requires the Government to issue guidance to those making decisions on the detention of individuals for the purpose of immigration control where issues of vulnerability are raised.",3
"This would be similar to the arrangements put in place as part of the ending of routine detention for families with children in 2014, a reform which demonstrates the Government’s commitment to balancing proportionate immigration controls with safeguarding vulnerable people.",3
"The effect would be that pregnant women could be detained only for up to 72 hours, for example, immediately prior to a managed return or to prevent illegal entry at the border where a return can be arranged quickly.",3
"I am sure that we are all in agreement that our focus should be on striking the right balance between protecting pregnant women and maintaining effective immigration control, and we believe that this amendment achieves that.",3
"Motions D1 and D2 would restrict that even further to only the most exceptional circumstances, which would almost certainly prevent detention to support removal, including immediately following arrival at the border and foreign criminals facing deportation.",3
"While there are circumstances where it is obvious that a woman is pregnant, there may be many instances where it is not immediately apparent, and the woman may not inform immigration officers of her condition.",3
"This is of particular concern where women are detained at borders without the facilities to conduct pregnancy tests, unlike at immigration removal centres.",3
We agreed that we needed to press ahead with strengthening the EU’s external borders to ensure that non-refugees are returned promptly and to back the new mission to disrupt the criminal gangs working between Greece and Turkey who are putting so many people’s lives at risk.,3
"After the hard work of the Home Secretary we have secured new powers against criminals from other countries, including powers to stop them coming here in the first place and powers to deport them if they are already here.",3
"We agreed longer re-entry bans for fraudsters and people who collude in sham marriages and an end to the frankly ridiculous situation where EU nationals can avoid British immigration rules when bringing their families from outside the EU This agreement broke new ground, with the European Council agreeing to reverse decisions from the European Court of Justice.",3
"We have already made sure that EU migrants cannot claim the new unemployment benefit, universal credit, while looking for work.",3
At this Council we agreed that EU migrants working in Britain can be prevented from sending child benefit home at UK rates.,3
"We also established a new emergency brake so that EU migrants will have to wait four years until they have full access to our benefits People said it was impossible to achieve real change in this area and that a four-year restriction on benefits was completely out of the question, yet that is what we have done.",3
"All along we have said that people should not be able to come here and get access to our benefits system straightaway—no more something for nothing—and that is what we have achieved I am sure that the discussion about welfare and immigration will be intense, but let me just make this point.",3
"In addition, our new safeguards lapse if we vote to leave the EU, so we might end up with free movement but without these new protections The fourth area where we wanted to make significant changes was to protect our country from further European political integration and to increase powers for our national Parliament.",3
"We will be in the parts of Europe that work for us, influencing the decisions that affect us, in the driving seat of the world’s biggest single market and with the ability to take action to keep our people safe, but we will be out of the parts of Europe that do not work for us: out of the euro, out of the eurozone bailouts, out of the passport-free, no-borders Schengen area, and permanently and legally protected from ever being part of an ever-closer union Of course, there is still more to do.",3
"In the weeks to come we need properly to face up to the economic consequences of a choice to leave I believe Britain will be stronger, safer and better off by remaining in a reformed European Union: stronger because we can play a leading role in one of the world’s largest organisations from within, helping to make the big decisions on trade and security that determine our future; safer because we can work with our European partners to fight cross-border crime and terrorism; and better off because British businesses will have full access to the free-trade single market, bringing jobs, investment and lower prices.",3
Will we have the power to insist that European countries share with us their border information so we know what terrorists and criminals are doing in Europe?,3
"I was encouraged to hear that a clear plan was being developed to address some of the immediate challenges: delivering security, tackling Daesh, restoring basic public services, countering people-trafficking, restarting oil production, and getting the economy back on track We agreed that delivering security was fundamental to improving the day-to-day lives of the Libyan people and creating an environment for economic reactivation.",3
I am clear about the fact that there is no appetite in Libya for foreign combat troops on the ground.,3
"I will, of course, keep the House informed of any plans that we develop in the future in response to requests from the Libyan Government, but the type of mission that we currently envisage would be focused on providing training and technical support, away from any front-line operations The Libyan economy is suffering from the effects of years of conflict and the impact of low oil prices.",3
"In my discussions, I highlighted our desire to work in close partnership with the GNA to make progress on that issue, including progress in tackling the people-smugglers and traffickers.",3
"As I understand it, the Kurdish army, the peshmerga, has said that, as a result of direct representations by the US Government, it is no longer recruiting foreign fighters, but militias are different and continue to recruit foreign volunteers.",3
The position of British citizens in the field has become even more complex recently because it appears that Turkey has applied pressure on Iraq to take action against the YPG and foreign fighters because of its links to the PKK and the Kurds.,3
"The two Britons and an Irishman arrested over the weekend were detained by the Iraqi Government due to “visa irregularities”, which seems a fairly spurious reason for arrest, given that there is no working Iraqi-Syrian border.",3
"The peshmerga are no longer accepting foreign volunteers, as I say, but the militias certainly are Why are individuals not being prevented from travelling when they openly inform officers of their intentions at the airport, as my constituent did, when these immigration and security officials should surely know that these individuals are likely to be arrested on their return?",3
"If British citizens are to be arrested under the Terrorism Act, why are we waving them through immigration and on to their planes?",4
"Of the 20 I have spoken with or their families, two were arrested under the Terrorism Act; four were questioned, but not arrested; 14 came and went at will, unquestioned, three of whom have been on a second or third tour of duty overseas.",3
That does not give me a great deal of confidence in our border controls.,3
"He talked about an anti-immigration rhetoric, and we have seen the increase in hate crime, for example, which has occurred post-Brexit.",3
"However, it goes further than that In addition to the Government’s attempt to require companies to report the number of foreign staff they employ, which my noble friend mentioned, under the Policing and Crime Bill currently going through this House the Government will require people who are detained by the police, where the police suspect the individual not to be a British citizen, to produce their passport.",3
"I cannot tell which group of people who are arrested will be required to produce their passport, but I suspect that it may largely be dictated by the colour of their skin.",3
What happens if the individual is a British citizen who does not have a passport?,4
"I raise this issue because it paints the picture of where the Government are going as regards immigration Under a provision in the Immigration Act recently passed by this House, when the police stop somebody driving a car whom they suspect not to be a British citizen, the police can search that person’s home for their driving licence without a warrant.",3
"Again, the question has to be raised: which drivers will be stopped by the police and taken to their home address to search for their passport?",3
"The whole thing shows the direction of travel that this Government are going in, which unfortunately not only provides—to use the current term—a hostile environment for illegal immigrants but does so for people who are here legally, and indeed for those who are born here but who do not appear at first glance to be British.",3
"What extra support are these schools going to need because they have pupils who are foreign nationals Unfortunately, all the evidence points to this being an immigration tactic rather than having anything to do with trying to improve the education of young people or supporting our schools.",3
"My Bill is to make illegal any marriage of a young person under the age of 18, straight or gay—and it applies to marriage and civil partnerships.",3
They cannot opt out of marriage It has been pointed out to me in recent days that a problem could arise with refugees and immigrants.,3
"It was suggested that I was trying to make immigration difficult for young people who had married as children, or prevent refugees coming here by erecting another barrier.",3
"However, in Committee I drew a parallel with the Immigration Act, where the Government proposed a philosophy of full cost recovery for visa applications and for the Immigration Service generally.",3
"I asked the Minister then, if she was not going to agree with amendments tabled to ensure full cost recovery for the issuing of firearm certificates, to explain why a different approach is being taken to the principle of full cost recovery when it comes to immigration.",3
"In particular, I asked her to refute the obvious allegation that the Government are discriminating against foreign nationals as against those who go hunting with guns for sport.",3
"There are very good reasons why visa applications and the like should not be set at full cost recovery levels, yet the Government appear determined that they should be, without any public consultation or a transitional period.",3
Can the Minister explain why foreign nationals are being treated differently from those who possess firearms I asked the Minister in Committee what consultation there had been with groups that represent immigrants or those who might apply for visas before the Government implemented full cost recovery for immigration visas.,3
"A handful of determined killers, influenced by intensifying extremist ideology in their country of origin and the right to visa-free travel as EU or US nationals, will create an additional nightmare for national security agencies I would like to put on record some key statistics relating to Bangladeshi minorities.",3
I regard the first duty of any Government to protect their own borders.,3
"The second duty is to protect the rights of the minorities who live within those borders I want to highlight some of the key findings of the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion and beliefs, Heiner Bielefeldt, who visited Bangladesh from 31 August to 9 September 2015.",3
"One link is the salient decline of the Hindu population in Bangladesh, which has shrunk significantly since the time of independence.",3
"Since September 2015, Daesh has claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks in Bangladesh In late September and early October 2015 two foreign nationals were shot and killed.",3
"Previous methods of attack have included crude explosives, grenades, shootings and knife attacks On 1 July, a terrorist attack at the Holey Artisan Bakery in the Gulshan 2 district of Dhaka resulted in the death of 20 hostages, mainly foreign nationals and 2 police officers.",3
"College lecturer Ripan Chakraborty, of the Madaripur district, was chopped to pieces in front of his class Several bloggers, human rights activists, atheists and authors, including foreign nationals, have been hacked to death in the past two years.",3
The UK Government should give careful consideration to minorities who are already in United Kingdom who have applied for asylum on the basis that they are seeking refugee status for their protection A wealth of information is available backing up what I have said in the House today—evidence of the attempt literally to purge Bangladesh of all religious minorities other than the Islamic majority.,3
"I make that point again and again, because we stand ready to act and to take charge where there are those links, and to see that if there are children in northern France who are separated from family in the UK, action is taken Those processes for family reunion are of course in addition to the unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who make their claims in this country.",3
"With over 3,000 asylum applications from unaccompanied children last year, I pay tribute to all those local authorities that, despite the unprecedented pressure on their services, are providing support to those young people.",3
"At the same time, we need to shut down the illegal migration routes to Europe that are exploited by human traffickers, who encourage people to risk their lives to make perilous journeys.",2
"Instead, we are committed to providing safe and legal routes for the most vulnerable refugees to resettle in the UK The success of the EU-Turkey migration agreement is a vital opportunity to end the misery and lethal risk that smugglers and organised criminals are causing on a daily basis.",3
We need to close down illegal crossings from Turkey to Greece and tackle migrant flows upstream.,2
"We are offering 75 expert personnel to help with the processing and administration of migrants in Greek reception centres, to act as interpreters, to provide medical support and to bolster our existing team assisting the Commission to ensure that there is effective and efficient co-ordination.",3
"Those teams, which are ready to be deployed, will include experts in supporting vulnerable groups, such as unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, and those trained to tackle people trafficking.",3
"That will help to ensure that vulnerable people, including children, are identified and can access asylum and support procedures as quickly as possible.",3
"I rise to speak to Alf Dubs’s amendment 87 to bring to the UK just 3,000 of the 26,000 unaccompanied child refugees in Europe.",3
"Although I also support Lords amendments to provide other protections for asylum seekers, others will speak on those I speak on behalf of many hundreds of people in Bristol West who have written to me, urging me to help refugees.",3
"It was given as a speech by Sir Thomas More, sheriff of London during Henry VIII’s reign, addressing rioters who protested against foreigners.",3
"He asks them to consider what they would do if they were refugees, which country would give them harbour, whether they would go “to France or Flanders, To any German province, Spain or Portugal”, and how they would feel if they were met there by “a nation of such barbarous temper” If the worst happened and our children were alone, fleeing war and persecution, would not every one of us hope that they would receive safe harbour in France or Flanders, Germany, Spain or Portugal?",3
"The police took her to the trafficking charity Unseen, which put her in touch with the Red Cross to see whether her sons could be traced Mrs Djane claimed asylum and was granted refugee status, but she spent the next two years searching for her sons.",3
She finally found them in a border town between Mali and Guinea.,3
"We would be failing in our duties if we did not show our leadership, and meet our legal obligations and moral imperatives to those refugees and asylum seekers.",3
"With regard to the idea that those 75 people are going to make all the difference, that is still not an alternative to Britain doing its bit to provide sanctuary as well The UNHCR reports that there have been instances of “children engaging in survival sex to pay smugglers to continue their journey, either because they have run out money, or because they have been robbed” Europol has warned that children, young women and lone refugees are being targeted for exploitation because there is not sufficient protection when they arrive, and that 10,000 child and teenage refugees have disappeared, often into the arms of criminal gangs.",3
"They are there right now, in tents, at risk of huge abuse, at risk of gangs, at risk of trafficking, and at risk of taking crazy risks, because that is what teenagers do.",3
"It is not an alternative to Governments acting and providing legal help The Minister said that if we take child refugees from Europe, that will encourage more to come, but that argument is deeply wrong.",3
Few of the child refugees in Europe have come because they want to travel to Britain.,3
"Many are trying to reach family, which will not change whether or not we take more child refugees.",3
"They may have been trafficked or separated from family along the way Action on smugglers, border checks, working with Turkey, a strategy for Libya, or providing alternative safe and legal routes—all of those things may make a difference in preventing people from making a perilous journey in the first place.",3
"The danger is that the Government are actually saying that it is better to leave them to face those risks and that we should be prepared to abandon thousands of children to a life of exploitation, prostitution and abuse, because that somehow might prevent other children from getting on a boat.",3
"Many of the refugees are a similar age to my children, who are in school and doing exams.",3
"It is an age at which children need support and help, not to be turned away When the Kindertransport legislation was passed in Parliament, MPs of all parties supported Britain’s leadership in helping child refugees.",3
"Alongside Alf Dubs, other Kindertransport survivors, such as Rabbi Harry Jacobi, who came across on one of the last boats out of Amsterdam, and Sir Erich Reich, have spoken out to urge us to do more now.",3
"We are rightly proud of what the Kindertransport did and of the cross-party support in Parliament, but will today’s vote on child refugees be a similar source of pride for future generations or a source of shame We rightly commemorate the Kindertransport and the life of Sir Nicholas Winton, who rescued hundreds of Jewish child refugees.",3
"I know that, in this matter, they have tried to use both their head and their heart Having seen the desperate scenes in the refugees camps in Lesbos and Calais, I have had a very brief window on the world of families fleeing war and persecution, and it is those memories that give me a very, very heavy heart today.",3
"Many of us from all parts of the House always felt that our initial offer to resettle 20,000 refugees was not enough.",3
"I know that the boats are overcrowded and not seaworthy because I saw them If the deal between the EU, Turkey and Greece is so fantastic in stopping the tide of daily arrivals, as we are told, then that means that the pull has stopped pulling.",3
"There are hotspots all over Europe: hotspots for trafficking, hotspots for abuse and hotspots for child prostitution on the Macedonian border, Italy and on our very own doorstep in Calais When part of the jungle was demolished, 120 children went missing.",3
"In one case, an 11-month-old baby separated from its mother was expected to claim asylum in France before any steps could be taken to reunite them—an 11-month-old baby.",3
I take issue with his point that the Navy has to make a binary choice between work at home and work overseas.,3
"Ships are deployed all over the world right now, and other ships are making ready to set to sea in response to whatever crises may unfold in the Euro-Atlantic over the coming weeks In addition, there is capacity to do as we do year round, which is to deploy naval resources into the channel for purposes such as fishery protection and, indeed, securing our border.",3
"The purpose of our nation’s armed forces is to secure the UK’s national security interests both at home and abroad, and I would argue that deploying our armed forces to ensure that our borders are robust is a perfectly appropriate use of them.",4
"Friend is very aware, there are parts of Europe right now in which state-sponsored illegal migration is being used as a sub-threshold weapon of competition.",2
"I am not suggesting for a second that the migration across the channel is that right now but, in the absence of robust defence of our borders, it could be in the future, and the MOD therefore has a perfectly reasonable role to play in ensuring that our borders are robustly protected My right hon.",3
Until the deterrent effect is achieved and the cross-channel route for small boats collapses There is a limit to my right hon.,3
"Indeed, he is right to note that the MOD has plenty of equity in providing stability in countries such as Iraq and in the Sahel, where the majority of migrants are coming from, and we are engaged in that Nobody is pretending that the presence of a rear admiral and a few extra Royal Navy ships solves this issue.",3
"The people traffickers and those rights lawyers who encourage, facilitate and give succour to people who know that they are not seeking asylum—who are economic migrants—deserve our condemnation.",3
"Will he arrange for a Minister—possibly the Home Secretary—to come to the House to reassure us that offshore processing, the deportation of illegal immigrants and secure accommodation for those awaiting deportation form part of the policy?",3
It will harden the UK’s resilience against hostile activity from foreign states and ensure that our world-class law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the tools that they need to protect our national security.,3
"The Bill will reform espionage laws dating from the beginning of the 20th century, introduce new offences to tackle foreign-state-linked sabotage and interference, and enhance police powers to support these measures A registration scheme will be created to help combat damaging or hostile influence exerted by foreign states in the UK.",3
"While the majority of the National Security Bill will focus on countering hostile threats from foreign states, the Bill will also include measures to prevent the exploitation of our civil legal aid and civil damage systems by convicted terrorists We must remain alert to the threat from terrorism.",3
"When it comes to confronting the evils of modern slavery and human trafficking, we simply cannot afford to stand still The new modern slavery Bill will build on our existing legislation to strengthen the requirements on businesses with a turnover of £36 million or more to eradicate modern slavery in their supply chains.",3
"The Bill will place the victims’ code into law, sending a clear signal about what victims can and should expect, and it will drive up standards by increasing transparency and oversight of victims’ services provided by the criminal justice agencies I have discussed the need for reform of our immigration and asylum system on numerous occasions here.",3
"It is what we will continue to do We cannot continue to operate a parallel system for those arriving in the United Kingdom illegally, having travelled through safe third countries.",3
The world-leading migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda is part of our comprehensive overhaul of the asylum system.,3
It will help to break the smugglers’ business model and prevent loss of life.,3
"Through the visa schemes we have set up and our wider humanitarian response, the Government have sent a message loud and clear: the UK stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine.",3
"Platforms will have to quickly remove illegal content, including terrorist material and child sexual abuse and exploitation, and there will be a particular focus on protecting children from harmful or inappropriate content.",3
"They said it was cruel to make people work on farms, yet they said it was not cruel for immigrant labour to come in and pick fruit and vegetables on farms.",3
Do they just not like immigrants?,3
"It is the right and decent thing to do in any civilised society We all know that the Labour party is trying to rebrand itself as the patriotic, low-tax party of law and order that is tough on illegal immigration.",3
"They need to make their mind up, because the same MPs were saying, a while back, that we should not deport foreign criminals at Christmas time because it was cruel.",3
"I think it is a great Christmas present, deporting criminals.",3
"The amendment proposes a new clause, headed: “Advertising assistance for unlawful immigration to the United Kingdom” Social media platforms are advertising how they can help illegal immigration into our country.",3
"Sky News googled it and came up with a list of the adverts No wonder sometimes people stop you in the street and say, “Do you know what you’re doing?”, because we would assume that the Government would stop illegal activity, published on a website for people to use while being exploited.",3
The explanatory statement says: “This amendment would provide it is an offence to advertise illegal routes to the UK.” Who could object to that?,3
"But the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, was quite right when he spoke about Amendment 36, which deals with the people smugglers—where else in the Nationality and Borders Bill are they actually being dealt with by the Government I do not know whether noble Lords saw it, but, today and yesterday, the Times, the Telegraph and other newspapers reported the latest statistics on migrant crossings.",3
"I make no comment on what is causing them, but it is a statistical fact that the Home Secretary promised that she would sort this out and deal with it and the Government promised that they would be tough on the borders and said that the point of leaving the EU was that we would take back control.",3
"There is all of that, but then we look at the statistics: the number of migrants crossing the channel this January has gone up six times compared with last year.",3
"We find out that this means that there have been 46 boats, compared with 15 last year.",3
"By the way, it is also pointed out that the French stopped 29 boats last month.",3
"We find out that part of the Government’s plan, announced in the Times and the Telegraph—not here, unless it was put in a Written Ministerial Statement or Question that I cannot find; it may have been, and I apologise if it was—is locking up all single male migrants.",3
"I just flicked through the paper and there it was, and I thought, “Goodness me.” But, seriously, that is a really serious policy initiative that will be part of the plan to deal with migrants crossing the channel.",3
Redirecting boats or strengthening the powers of the Border Force to stop and redirect boats is push-back.,3
"They are not going to use a destroyer—nobody is that stupid about this; they will not have a naval destroyer pushing a dinghy back—but is a naval commander going to be able to direct a smaller Border Force vessel to redirect a dinghy, as Tom Pursglove MP said in the papers today?",3
"I thought it was one thing, but now, according to the papers, it appears to be another All I am saying is that you can see why the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is so important, because it would require the Government to publish reports on what is going on regarding discussions with Governments and authorities, not only of our own country but of others, to tackle the smugglers.",3
"These people are exploited by the people smugglers, yet this is mentioned hardly anywhere in the Bill.",3
"Indeed, instead of dealing with the smugglers, the Bill changes the way we treat refugees and victims fleeing war and persecution, who are being loaded on to these boats.",3
"That is why I am labouring this: Amendment 36 is really important If noble Lords get the chance to have a look, Amendment 36 also says, quite rightly, in proposed new subsection (2): “The report must focus on steps other than the provisions of this Act.” What sensible person, in seeking to deal with people smuggling, refugees and asylum seekers, does not also believe and understand that part of the solution lies in dealing with the situations that individuals are fleeing from?",3
"I have not spoken to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about this, but I suspect that what she is also trying to do through this amendment is say that you deal with asylum seekers and refugees not through sanctions, provisions, criminalising people and making them afraid but by addressing the problems in the countries, areas and regions they are fleeing from I tell your Lordships this: if I was living with my family and we were being bombed, I would flee.",3
"If you want to deal with asylum seekers and refugees, of course you must have a policy that deals with them when they arrive, but you also have to understand why they are fleeing and escaping from the country in which they were born and do something about it there I know that the noble Lord, Lord Russell, is on the Council of Europe; he and I have spoken about many of these things.",4
"I think I am right in saying that the noble Lord and I went to Jordan, near its border with Syria.",3
"We went to a refugee camp in Jordan where there were hundreds of thousands of people; I went to a refugee camp in Angola where there were more than a million people Some of the poorest countries in the world are dealing with some of the biggest refugee crises, and sometimes with almost more resource and compassion than we do.",3
"When nearly 1 million people came across the border, they did not turn round to them and say, “We’re going to split you into different groups” but “We’re going to do what we can to help you”, while recognising that the problem in Syria or elsewhere also needed to be addressed.",3
"I will then address the amendment put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, on advertising illegal routes to the UK.",3
"As I said, I thank all noble Lords for their contributions The UK takes smuggling and illegal migration extremely seriously.",3
"We are absolutely committed to tackling organised immigration crime, or OIC, in all its forms.",3
"To tackle this threat, we have in place a multi-agency OIC taskforce which brings together law enforcement, border guards, immigration officials and prosecutors to tackle organised crime groups involved in people smuggling.",3
"This taskforce is currently working with partners in some 17 source and transit countries In addition, there are already agreements in place to tackle smuggling and illegal migration.",3
The UK is committed to working with France to maintain the security of our shared border and to tackle illegal migration.,4
Last year’s investment saw the French doubling the numbers of officers patrolling beaches Addressing the organised crime groups that facilitate illegal migration to the UK remains a UK priority.,3
"Since the UK-France JIC was established, along with France we have dismantled 17 small-boat organised criminal groups and secured over 400 arrests I stress that the UK has a strong stance on smuggling and illegal migration and has agreements in place with near neighbours to reflect this.",3
"It may hinder the fruitful and open dialogue on these issues between the UK and its international partners, many of which would not agree to their discussions and domestic activity aimed at reducing people smuggling to be published to a domestic UK audience I cannot support Amendment 36 because it is not appropriate to provide a running commentary on the actions that are being taken to tackle people smugglers, much of which will be sensitive activity, particularly from an operational point of view, and based on intelligence sharing with the aim of protecting vulnerable people If I may be permitted a personal anecdote, I have some experience in operational sensitivities.",3
"When I served in the Royal Hong Kong Police Force, I spent much of my time on the border and was heavily involved in matters of migration.",3
"Some of it was profoundly harrowing, particularly the Vietnamese boat people, who were helped by Hong Kong and the Royal Hong Kong Police Force, but much of it was organised by criminal gangs.",3
"If the smugglers, who in colloquial Cantonese were known as snakeheads, got wind of our countermeasures, they changed their methods, and changed them very quickly.",3
"It is slightly off-topic but, given the tone of the debate, it is worth doing Obviously, there is a UK resettlement scheme, which commenced in February 2021 and prioritises the resettlement of refugees.",3
"There is a refugee family reunion scheme, which many noble Lords referred to.",3
"On the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, we have granted over 39,000 refugee family reunion visas since 2015.",3
"There is the well-known Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme, the Afghan relocations and assistance policy and the immigration route for British national overseas status holders from Hong Kong.",3
We agree unreservedly with the need to target those who assist unlawful immigration to the UK.,3
We are taking steps to combat illegal migration and the activities associated with people smuggling by increasing the maximum penalty for facilitation from 14 years’ imprisonment to life imprisonment.,3
This aligns with the maximum penalty for human trafficking as contained in the Modern Slavery Act.,3
"Currently, Section 25A relates to helping the arrival or entry for gain—I stress that—of an asylum seeker into the UK.",3
"Removing the “for gain” element from Section 25A will allow for successful prosecution of those facilitating the arrival or entry into the UK of asylum seekers where the “for gain” element cannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt To be absolutely clear, the focus of Clause 40 is on criminals who act to exploit and endanger people.",3
"We have made it clear that persons do not commit an offence of facilitation if the act is done by, on behalf of, or co-ordinated by, Her Majesty’s coastguard or overseas equivalent.",3
"Having said that, however, I respect the intention behind the amendments in seeking to eliminate the distinction between two tiers of refugees.",3
"I hope that nobody groans when we cite the 1951 convention, which prohibits the penalisation of refugees “on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened … present themselves without delay … and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.” The Bill before us purports to change the way in which the provisions of the convention are applied, with important divergences from hitherto accepted practices I am a member of the Council of Europe.",3
"There are those who are pushing asylum seekers back, or else denying them disembarkation.",3
"Others are protecting their borders, building fences, sometimes deploying their military and even using live ammunition.",3
"Some are transferring their protection obligations to other—usually poorer—nations and isolated islands, detaining asylum seekers in poor conditions indefinitely.",3
"Nor must we forget those who resort to the use of Covid-19, economic challenges or irregular arrivals of migrants as cover for disproportionate measures, restricting access to asylum and rights.",3
"That commission provides authoritative guidance in a manner consistent with the 1951 convention’s ambition to ensure, “the widest possible exercise of these fundamental rights and freedoms” by refugees.",3
"UNHCR, incidentally, has responsibility for all the 80-plus million refugees spread around the world.",3
Their views should be heard I have some figures here from the latest YouGov poll on the subject of immigration.,3
"The interesting thing is that immigration is now regarded as the third most important subject after health and the economy—even more important than Covid, curiously; I am not sure about that but, none the less, that is what it says.",3
"A previous YouGov poll said that 70% of people thought illegal crossings were a serious issue, so the public are well aware of the issue; indeed, they have been seeing it every night on television, particularly during last summer.",3
Some 63% said that illegal immigrants should not be allowed to settle here while 60% said that they should be removed.,3
"In a June 2021 YouGov poll, 60% said they thought that illegal immigrants should be banned from claiming asylum, while only 20% thought they should be allowed to claim asylum.",3
"Those are opinion polls so take them for what they are worth—we all have our views about opinion polls—but they are a snapshot of opinion in the recent past My own view is that, on an emotional subject such as immigration, you need to develop a policy with which the British people are comfortable.",3
"If we had had a policy on immigration more widely that the British people had been comfortable with in the last 20 years, we might not have had Brexit.",3
"Sadly, whether we like it or not, immigration was a huge issue in the Brexit debate.",3
I put it to the noble Lord that the extent to which people’s views on immigration were ignored was a factor leading to the decision that we took.,3
"Australia, for example, has divided people into those coming in in the normal, legal way and those coming in illegally, and that has not been denounced by the United Nations.",3
"In Australia, they have a cross-party agreement on the immigration policy.",3
"These are not only problems which the Government must face simply to be responsible and give people a sense that they control things and that borders mean something, which is their bottom-line responsibility, but also the issues of immigration With what we have here, if we can reduce it to the particular problem which the Government face on illegal immigration across the channel, the approach they are adopting helps, first, to deal with the pull factor, by pointing out the advantages of the normal asylum-seeking methods of getting into this country, on which this country has a good record; and, secondly, to dissuade people from adopting the illegal methods which they are at present forced into using.",3
"If you decide on a limit and people are comfortable with that, you can decide how many immigrants will be allowed into the country in any one year and then deal with the problem of illegal immigration.",3
"However, I do think that it is very important in the context of Clause 11 to make a distinction in Committee between immigration and asylum.",3
"Clearly, for some people the equivalent is a discussion without Brexit, but I am not one of them It is important to make this distinction between immigration and asylum, which are both big and important debates, but they are too often conflated—not just in our discussions in this Committee but to some extent in Clause 11 itself.",3
"The noble Lord, Lord Horam, did not have the opportunity to reply to my question—all sorts of people intervened in his speech, to be fair—but if somebody is a convention refugee, they are not and never were an illegal migrant.",3
What was so important about the right reverend Prelate’s speech was its specificity to the refugees’ journey and the way that that would be affected by this differentiation.,3
"I congratulate him on that, because it is a very good way to analyse Clause 11: whether it works and whether it complies with the refugee convention Why is compliance with the refugee convention so important?",3
"The reason why the refugee convention is so important is because, after two world wars, it was literally the world’s apology for the Holocaust.",3
That is the best way that I can sum up why the refugee convention is so important.,3
"My Lords, I remind everyone that Clause 11 is not only not about immigration, let alone illegal immigration; it is not even about asylum seekers.",3
It is titled “Differential treatment of refugees”—people who have been recognised and accepted as entitled to asylum in this country.,3
What Clause 11 means is that the Government want to penalise a certain category of people who have been accepted as refugees.,3
"On the one hand, we accept them as refugees, but then we are going to turn round and penalise them in various ways for how they arrived.",3
"I have agreed with all the critics of Clause 11, and I agree that Clause 11 as a whole needs to get the chop Clause 11 wants to penalise people with a much-reduced permission to stay; by requiring several frequent applications for further permission to stay; by keeping them in uncertainty for many years; by excluding them from public funds; and by delaying or denying altogether a visa for family reunion.",3
"It is costly to that individual and it is costly to society, because it is not good for society when you have people who are unable to integrate and living with instability, isolation, possible destitution, homelessness and separation from family.",2
"They have been recognised as refugees, which means that we expect these people to be part of our society.",3
We are told that the asylum system is broken.,2
That suggests that some of those who profess to know what public opinion is may not necessarily be right when the public have a chance to hear the arguments presented to them and are then asked to make a decision Clause 11 is about differential treatment of recognised refugees and its impact and implications.,3
We believe that it contravenes the 1951 refugee convention.,3
"It sets a dangerous precedent by creating a two-tier system for refugees, and it is also inhumane.",2
"Under the Bill, the Home Secretary will be given sweeping powers to decide asylum cases based on how someone arrives in this country and their mode of transport, not on the strength of their claim—contrary to the 1951 refugee convention, of which Britain was a founding member Under the clause, only those refugees who meet specific additional requirements will be considered group 1 refugees and benefit from the rights currently granted to all refugees by the refugee convention.",3
"Other refugees who are not deemed to meet those criteria will be designated as group 2 refugees, and the Secretary of State will be empowered to draft rules discriminating against group 2 refugees with regard to the rights to which they are entitled under the refugee convention, as well as their fundamental right to family unity.",3
"Clause 11 does, however, provide examples of ways in which the two groups might be treated differently, even though they are nearly all recognised as genuine refugees.",3
"Those who travel via a third country, who do not have documents or who did not claim asylum immediately will routinely be designated as group 2 refugees.",3
"The clause goes on to set out how the length of limited leave, access to indefinite leave, family reunion —that is, whether family members, mainly women and children, are entitled to join them—and access to public funds are likely to become areas for discrimination against group 2 refugees The government policy paper, the New Plan for Immigration, proposed that instead of fully fledged refugee status, group 2 refugees will be granted “temporary protection” for a period of no longer than 30 months, “after which individuals will be reassessed for return to their country of origin or removal to” a safe third country.",3
"Temporary protection status “will not include an automatic right to settle in the UK, family reunion rights will be restricted and there will be no recourse to public funds except in cases of destitution”— in other words, a state, deliberately created, of complete uncertainty over their future for group 2 refugees Clause 11 would therefore make a significant and unprecedented change in the law, resulting in the UK treating accepted refugees less generously, based on the journey they have taken to reach the UK and the timeliness of their asylum claim.",3
This attempt to create two different classes of recognised refugee is surely inconsistent with the refugee convention and has no basis in international law.,3
"The refugee convention, which was enshrined in UK law in 1954, contains a single unitary definition of “refugee”.",3
"It defines a refugee solely according to their need for international protection because of feared persecution on the grounds of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.",3
Anyone who meets that definition and is not excluded is a refugee and entitled to the protection of the refugee convention The Commons committee considering the Bill heard in evidence from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ representative to the UK that this clause and the Bill were inconsistent with the UN convention and international law.,3
"By penalising refugees for how they were able to get to the UK, the Bill builds walls against people in need of protection and shuts the door on many seeking a safe haven.",3
Most refugees have absolutely no choice about how they travel.,2
"Is it really this Government’s intention and desire to penalise refugees who may, for example, as a matter of urgency, have had to find an irregular route out of Afghanistan?",3
"Is an interpreter from Afghanistan who took a dangerous journey to our shores less deserving than a refugee who was lucky enough to make it here on one of the flights out of the country The Government acknowledge that such journeys are very dangerous and sometimes fatal, yet they do not seem to appreciate the compulsion—that the alternative of not doing so is even worse—which drives people to make such journeys.",3
Simply making the journey more dangerous or the asylum system more unwelcoming will not change that.,2
"Of the first 5,000 people who came in 2020 by boat, well over 90% were deemed by the Home Office to be eligible to apply for asylum: they were genuine asylum seekers.",3
They were not here illegally—but they will become illegal if the Bill is enacted Penalising people for how they arrived in the UK has particular implications for already vulnerable groups of refugees such as women and those from LGBT communities.,3
"By not providing safe routes, the Government are also fuelling the business model of the people smugglers they claim their proposals will destroy, and then penalising the victims they have had a responsibility for creating.",3
"The Conservative-led Foreign Affairs Committee, of which the Home Secretary was then a member, warned in 2019: “A policy that focuses exclusively on closing borders will drive migrants to take more dangerous routes, and push them into the hands of criminal groups” The Government’s impact assessment warns that increased deterrence in this manner “could encourage these cohorts to attempt riskier means of entering the UK.” As has been said, Clause 11 also says that group 1 refugees must have “come to the United Kingdom directly from a country or territory where their life or freedom was threatened” In other words, the Government are setting an expectation that, to be recognised as a refugee supposedly deserving of the support usually afforded, the UK must be the first safe country in which they have sought asylum.",3
"Commenting on the Bill, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said: “Requiring refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach would undermine the global, humanitarian, and cooperative principles on which the refugee system is founded.” It was pointed out in oral evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights that it was unlikely that “any country close to the main countries of origin of refugees would have ever considered signing a convention if that meant that they would assume total and entire responsibility for all the refugees.” In addition, when the refugee convention came into being in the early 1950s, there was little or no commercial air travel, so any refugee reaching this country would have to have crossed land borders from safe states.",3
"Yet there was no view then that such a refugee should be seen—as under this Bill and the Government’s interpretation of the refugee convention in international law—as a criminal liable to up to four years in prison and to being sent back to France, and with any claim for asylum being regarded as inadmissible Even within Europe, most of the countries that refugees pass through on their way to the UK already host significantly more refugees and asylum seekers per population than the UK does.",3
"As it is, France takes three times more asylum seekers than the UK, as does Germany.",3
Global provision for refugees could not function if all refugees claimed asylum in the first safe country they came to.,3
"As my noble friends Lord Griffiths of Burry Port and Lord Coaker have pointed out, most refugees are hosted in developing countries and the UK receives fewer asylum applications than most other European countries.",3
"Under international law, the primary responsibility for identifying refugees and affording international protection rests with the state in which an asylum seeker arrives and seeks that protection Clause 11 sets out a non-exhaustive list of the ways in which refugees who arrive irregularly and become group 2 refugees may be treated differently.",3
"The Explanatory Notes to the Bill state that the purpose of this is “to discourage asylum seekers from travelling to the UK”, and to encourage “individuals to seek asylum in the first safe country they reach after fleeing persecution.” It is not clear, since the Government have provided no explanation, how the stated aim will result from the policy; perhaps the Government in their response will provide that explanation Evidence from many refugee organisations suggests that refugees seek asylum in the UK for a range of reasons, such as proficiency in English, family links or a common heritage based on past colonial histories.",3
"In addition, refugees do not cite the level of leave granted or other elements of the asylum system as decisive factors.",3
"The Home Office’s own study from 2002—I do not think there has been one since then—noted that there was little evidence that respondents seeking to come to the UK had a detailed knowledge of UK asylum procedures, benefit entitlements or the availability of work in the UK.",3
"There was even less evidence that the respondents had a comparative knowledge of how these conditions varied between different European destination countries Given that individuals have little knowledge of the asylum systems of the countries they end up in, it is not clear that differential treatment will dissuade individuals from coming to the UK via safe countries.",3
"However, what the Government are proposing will certainly result in a refugee population that is less secure, and it will punish those who have been recognised through the legal system as needing international protection, such as women and girls fleeing the Taliban or Uighurs fleeing genocide in China The Explanatory Notes also state that 62% of asylum claims in the UK up to September 2019 were from people who entered irregularly.",3
"This means that the policy intention is to impose strictures on the rights and entitlements of the majority of refugees coming to the UK, even though we take fewer than comparable countries.",3
"Those penalties would target not just those who have entered the UK irregularly or have made dangerous journeys but all those who have not come directly to the UK, regularly or irregularly, from a country or territory where their life or freedom was threatened, those who have delayed claiming asylum or overstayed, and even those who arrive in the UK without entry clearance and who claim asylum immediately.",3
"As many noble Lords have said, a 1951 convention and a 1957 protocol together make the refugee convention, which sets out the UK’s and other signatories’ international obligations The UNHCR’s considered view—as well as that of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, from what I understand—is that the Bill is fundamentally at odds with the Government’s commitment to uphold the United Kingdom’s obligations under the refugee convention.",3
"Clause 11 is at the heart of this considered view The Government seem to misunderstand the purpose of international conventions, such as the refugee convention.",3
"I will address his concerns about protected characteristics in a future group More honestly, some Conservatives—and the noble Baroness, Lady Fox of Buckley, who has apparently given up—have called the refugee convention outdated.",3
"They say that they can treat asylum seekers differently, depending on their circumstances, and that this is in compliance with the refugee convention Much has been said—and we have had many briefings on this clause—but I will restrict my comments to the primary concerns of the custodian of the refugee convention, the UNHCR.",3
"With most refugees—at least before the fall of Afghanistan—making their own way to safety from the African continent, only Turkey and those countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea would be legally able to take refugees, if that were the case.",3
The UNHCR says that already three-quarters of refugees are hosted in countries neighbouring their own.,3
"As other noble Lords have said, almost all the countries through which refugees pass on their way to the UK already have more refugees and asylum-seeking applicants than the UK does This is a global crisis, requiring a global response in which every country plays its part and where every country, including the UK, takes its fair share of genuine asylum seekers.",3
"A disproportionate burden should not be placed on border countries; nor should it be that the further north and west you go, the fewer asylum seekers you have to take The UNHCR says that the claims of refugees seeking safety in the UK need to be considered solely on the basis of whether the circumstances from which they have fled justify their refugee status.",3
"If a refugee is entitled to the rights given to him or her by the refugee convention, all those rights should be exercisable in any convention country, including the UK.",4
This clause would deny recognised refugees the rights guaranteed to them under the refugee convention and international law.,3
The noble Lord talked about illegal immigrants.,3
"Genuine refugees are not illegal immigrants The noble Lord, Lord Horam, and other noble Lords talked about public opinion.",3
Some 94% of immigrants to the United Kingdom are not refugees.,3
What the public do not understand is that we do not have record numbers crossing the channel in order to claim asylum by clandestine means.,3
"Equally, there is ample discretion available in respect of whether a person is granted group 1 or group 2 refugee status.",3
"We have gone further in our defence of refugee family reunion, noting that we will continue to uphold our international obligations under Article 8, but in any event, there is no requirement to apply such entitlements in each and every case.",3
"That is why we have retained a considerable amount of discretion in the drafting Turning to Amendment 55, I do not think it would be appropriate or right for us to step outside of the existing power to make immigration rules under the Immigration Act 1971.",3
"This is the same power that we use to implement most other aspects of UK immigration policy, including but not limited to asylum policy.",3
"There will always be discretion in our policies to make the right decisions in each case, and that extends to the Immigration Rules I cannot agree to Amendment 39, which would remove the requirement for a person to claim without delay to be a group 1 refugee.",3
"That means that anyone claiming asylum, regardless of whether that was done at the last moment to defer removal, could be a group 1 refugee.",3
"We should ensure that, where appropriate, family members of refugees are not treated more or less favourably than the lead applicant, but the flexibility that we wish to retain will also enable us to respond sensitively to particular circumstances as appropriate, including in respect of how we treat family members.",3
"However, we want to retain the ability to respond flexibly to challenging situations that might require us to do otherwise in respect of length of leave for a refugee and their family I turn to Amendment 41, in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Etherton.",3
"We envisage that the provision will apply in cases where a refugee meets the first two limbs of Article 31— that is to say, they came direct and claimed “without delay”—but, at the time of the claim, they had entered or were present in the UK unlawfully, having, for instance, overstayed an economic migrant visa To illustrate, let us say a person overstayed their visa and then lodged an asylum claim.",3
"Because they had entered the UK directly and ostensibly claimed without delay, they might be eligible for group 1 refugee status but, due to having overstayed, we would also check whether they had “good cause for their illegal … presence” at the point of claim.",3
"If they had no good reason for having been in the UK illegally, they might be liable for group 2 status.",4
An example of where good cause could be shown might be if a person had overstayed their visa and then lodged an asylum claim—a very similar situation to that described by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham.,3
"If their reason for overstaying and lodging an asylum claim while in the UK illegally was on the grounds that they feared presenting to the authorities because they were homosexual, in such a case this may well amount to a good cause Suffice it to say that the powers in the Bill are broad and flexible and therefore enable us to exercise discretion where appropriate, including with respect to “good cause”, which will be reflected in guidance to caseworkers I turn my attention to Clause 11 as it currently stands.",3
These powers are primarily intended to uphold the “first safe country of asylum” principle.,4
"Clause 11 provides a power, as noble Lords have pointed out—they are not very happy about it—for the UK to differentiate according to whether people satisfy certain criteria based on those in Article 31.1 of the refugee convention.",3
"Instead, they are based on the criteria within Article 31 of the convention: whether someone came directly and claimed without delay, and, where applicable, had “good cause for their illegal entry or presence” The clause acts on our commitment to do everything we can to deter individuals, as I have said, from making dangerous and unnecessary journeys through safe third countries, often putting lives at risk.",3
"With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement on the United Kingdom’s approach to the global migration challenge The United Kingdom has a long and proud history of offering sanctuary to refugees.",4
"In addition, we have welcomed more than 40,000 people in recent years through our refugee family reunion routes.",3
"This Government have done more than any other in recent history to support those fleeing persecution, conflict or instability But we cannot focus our support on those who need it most or effectively control our borders without tackling illegal migration, which is facilitated by people smugglers—serious organised criminals who profit from human misery, who do not care about people drowning in the channel or suffocating in the back of containers.",3
This type of illegal migration puts unsustainable pressures on our public services and local communities.,2
"Every day, the broken asylum system costs the taxpayer almost £5 million in hotel accommodation alone.",3
The cost of the asylum system is the highest in over two decades at over £1.5 billion As the Prime Minister said last week: “We cannot sustain a parallel illegal system.,3
"Our compassion may be infinite, but our capacity to help people is not.” That is why the new plan for immigration and its legislative vehicle—the Nationality and Borders Bill—are so vital.",3
"Access to the UK’s asylum system should be based on need, not on the ability to pay people smugglers.",2
"There is a global migration crisis that demands innovative and international solutions, and this Government are taking firm action When we published the new plan for immigration back in March last year, we set out three very clear objectives: to increase the fairness and efficacy of our system so that we can better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum; to deter illegal and dangerous routes of entry to the UK, thereby breaking the business model of criminal smuggling networks and protecting the lives of those they endanger; and to remove more easily from the UK those with no right to be here The Ministry of Defence has taken command of small boat operations in the channel.",3
Every small boat incident will be investigated to determine who piloted the boat and could therefore be liable for prosecution.,3
A nationwide dispersal system will be introduced so that asylum pressures are more equally spread across local authorities.,3
"Currently, 53% of local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales do not accommodate asylum seekers under the dispersal system.",3
"It is simply unfair that a national burden should be felt disproportionately by certain areas of the country For the first time, the Government are building asylum reception centres to end the practice of housing asylum seekers in expensive hotels.",3
"Far from being outlandish, as some in the Opposition have commented, asylum reception centres are already operational in safe EU countries such as Greece and they are funded by the EU Just last week, I signed a new world-leading migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda.",3
"Under this partnership, those who travel to the UK by illegal and dangerous routes, including by small boats across the channel, may be relocated to Rwanda, where they will have their asylum claims considered.",3
"Those in need of protection will be given up to five years of support, including education and employment training and help with integration, accommodation and healthcare, so that they can thrive there.",3
"Rwanda is a state party to the 1951 United Nations refugee convention and the seven core United Nations human rights conventions, and has a strong system for refugee resettlement.",4
"The United Nations has used Rwanda for several years to relocate refugees, and of course it was the European Union that first funded that This agreement deals a major blow to the people smugglers and their evil trade in human cargo.",4
"Change is needed, because people are dying attempting to come to the UK by illegal and dangerous routes.",2
"This partnership is the type of international co-operation needed to make the global immigration system fairer, keep people safe and give them opportunities to flourish.",3
"This will help to break the people smugglers’ business model and prevent loss of life, while ensuring protection for those who are genuinely vulnerable.",3
This Government are delivering the first comprehensive overhaul of the asylum system and of this type of illegal migration in decades.,3
"Access to the UK’s asylum system must be based on need, not on the ability to pay people smugglers.",2
"Our new plan for immigration will improve support for those directly fleeing oppression, persecution and tyranny through safe and legal routes.",3
"It will deter illegal and dangerous routes of entry to the UK, make it easier to remove those with no right to be in the UK and provide a common-sense approach to controlling immigration, both legal and illegal.",3
"When she occupied a seat in the Blair Government, I do not remember her exploding in synthetic rage when all those policies were implemented, after Acts were passed in 1999, 2002 and 2004 to bring about similar partnerships —the same partnerships, by the way, that were used to establish the Dublin regulations to return inadmissible asylum seekers to EU member states.",3
Lady and the Opposition demonstrates their absolute inability to understand this issue—the differentiation between legal and illegal migration.,3
They stand for open borders and uncontrolled immigration.,2
Lady put forward an alternative that would actually seek to deal with people-trafficking and deaths in the channel.,3
"It will not hurt smugglers, but it will further seriously harm people who have fled persecution.",2
"It will do untold damage to the international system of refugee protection, and to what little remains of the UK’s reputation for upholding international law.",3
"As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has said, people fleeing persecution should not be “traded like commodities”, and in words of the Refugee Council, this is nothing short of cash for deportations.",3
"We know that 85% of refugees are in the developing or least developed countries, yet here is the wealthy UK offering them cash to take some more.",4
Can she say what percentage of asylum seekers coming to the UK will be subjected to this abysmal treatment?,3
"We are told people will be screened before transfer, but how can a pathetic screening interview possibly pick out trafficking survivors, torture victims or LGBT people?",3
The intention is to erase the proposal contained in the Bill to introduce powers to export offshore any person in the UK who is seeking asylum without first considering their claim.,3
"Few would disagree that protection and control of our borders, primary responsibilities of any Government, are noble and necessary objectives.",3
"A Home Secretary must be able to discharge her duties in this respect, which include expediting deportation swiftly and without delay where illegality has been determined under the rules.",3
"In very literal terms, Clause 28 amends the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which states that a person seeking asylum cannot be removed from the UK while their asylum claim is being processed—in other words, before a final decision is given on their refugee status, including access to an appeal.",3
"However, paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 to the Bill withdraws those rights by allowing the transfer of any asylum seeker to any country which will be listed in Section 77 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended by Schedule 3 Before Brexit, under the Dublin regulations, the UK Government could remove an asylum seeker from the UK while their claim was still pending but only to return them to the EU country of first entry and only after having issued a certificate under Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration Act that permitted them a legal right to do so.",3
"However, Clause 28 would provide the Home Secretary with the legal power to forcibly remove any asylum seeker from the UK while their claim is still pending to another country which the Government have deemed safe.",3
This goes against our legal and constitutional principles and surely should be repudiated All credible immigration systems must first acknowledge the distinction between immigration and asylum.,3
"The Bill’s failure to disentangle these definitions is significant because in the Government’s bid to control overall immigration, it will be vulnerable people—those fleeing conflict and persecution—who would be disproportionately and adversely affected Many years ago, I oversaw an inquiry that included the viability of offshoring.",3
"We quickly judged that to be deeply flawed as an idea, but the problems we identified around domestic offshoring are almost trivial compared with the problems we would face by offshoring asylum seekers to foreign territory.",3
"For one thing, it would be a clear breach of our principles in the 1951 convention on refugees.",3
"We may be abrogating our responsibilities for dealing with applications, as well as those to the asylum seekers themselves, who, by international law, should be able to retain control over where and when they submit those requests.",3
"Indeed, a person’s physical removal from the UK would effectively terminate their claim for asylum in the UK, transferring it instead to a third country.",3
"I refer to my entry in the register of Members’ interests The question of offshore detention is undoubtedly one of the most controversial aspects of this Bill, which is designed to stem the flow of small boats from France.",3
"Irregular migrants face dangerous journeys: they are unprotected, they accumulate debt, and they have no legal recourse.",2
The limited opportunities for legal migration force individuals to use people smugglers where there is a risk of being trafficked.,2
"During the asylum seeker’s journey, the fine line with human trafficking—the acquisition of people by force, fraud or deception with the aim of exploiting them—can be easily crossed.",3
"On arrival on our shores, we greet you and, before we have even assessed whether or not you are a refugee, put you on a plane and take you back to the continent from which you came.",3
"The best hope of a fair, just and affordable solution to the issue of the Calais boats still lies with a diplomatic solution with the French and EU nations.",3
"This is a win-win solution that would genuinely destroy the economic model of the people smugglers, would cost less and would be far more humane Could my noble friend the Minister also provide an estimate of the cost of offshore processing?",3
The estimates of what the Australians pay for one asylum seeker held in detention vary from that amount to eight times that.,3
"That is where we are now I point out that, after the success of this policy in Australia, the Australian Government were enabled to expand the legal routes for asylum seekers to go to that country because it ceased to be controversial: immigration was less controversial as a consequence of the anti-boat policy being successful.",3
"The fact is that, as I have said before in these debates, if the public do not buy into the policy, you will have problems in persuading them to have more immigration.",3
"If they buy into it because they can see that you are controlling your borders, they have a more relaxed attitude to immigration and accept higher levels of it because they can see that they are in control of both the amount and the type of immigration coming in Therefore, there is a prize at the end of this for those who genuinely want to have more immigration, frankly, than we have at the moment, and if you can seem to be in control.",3
"What worries people is if you are not in control—if they can see clearly that people are behaving illegally getting here, jumping the queue and all the rest of it.",3
"My Lords, the Government’s position in justifying this and other measures in the Bill rests on the UK’s so-called excellent track record on refugees, and the Minister has repeatedly pointed to the UK’s track record on resettlement schemes.",3
"The UNHCR thinks differently: “Resettlement programmes, while welcome, are, by themselves, an inadequate means for fairly distributing global responsibilities towards refugees and sharing the burden currently shouldered by major host countries.” It goes on to give the facts about the numbers who are making their own way from areas where people are being persecuted.",3
"It concludes: “For all of these reasons, the Bill undermines, rather than promotes, the Government’s stated goal of improving the United Kingdom’s ‘ability to provide protection to those who would be at risk of persecution on return to their country of nationality.’” As the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Moulsecoomb, has just said, one of the reasons for offshoring is to temporarily house asylum seekers while their claims are being considered.",3
"Would the Minister like to comment on an article in the Times on Saturday that claimed that Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, “wants to … reject Channel migrants’ claims for asylum within a fortnight of them reaching Britain” The story claims that “government lawyers raised concerns over the plans” but the Secretary of State “believes a fortnight is a ‘reasonable’ window for immigration officials” to make such a decision.",3
Does she believe that two weeks is a reasonable timeframe to consider asylum seekers’ claims?,3
"This is a hopeless prescription from which no good can possibly come” The Home Office is seeking the power not only to remove an asylum seeker to any country while it considers their claim, but to do so and then tell that country, “If you think they are a refugee, you take them.",3
I do not know how the Government think they can persuade another country to take the UK’s unwanted asylum seekers on either a temporary or a permanent basis.,3
"According to Amnesty and Migrant Voice, offshoring by Australia effectively excluded legal, judicial, medical, humanitarian and media scrutiny; has cost a fortune—over £500 million a year, according to the British Red Cross—and, contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Horam, seems to have seen or heard, has failed to stop those seeking asylum, including those arriving in Australia by boat.",3
"The UNHCR says: “As UNHCR has seen in several contexts, offshoring of asylum processing often results in the forced transfer of refugees to other countries with inadequate State asylum systems, treatment standards and resources”, which amendments in this group seek to address “It can lead to situations in which asylum seekers are indefinitely held in isolated places where they are ‘out of sight and out of mind’, exposing them to serious harm … UNHCR has voiced its profound concerns about such practices, which have ‘caused extensive, unavoidable suffering for far too long’, left people ‘languishing in unacceptable circumstances’ and denied ‘common decency.’” I am hoping that this apparently unworkable and morally repugnant provision is yet another paper tiger, designed to appeal to the Daily Mail in deterring genuine asylum seekers, but that it is no more than propaganda.",3
"My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have spoken to this group of amendments, and I thank my noble friend Lord Kirkhope of Harrogate for tabling his Amendments 100, 101 and 102 On the back of my noble friend’s point, it might be helpful to clarify the definitions of “asylum seeker”, “refugee” and “economic migrant.” An asylum seeker is a person, either in transit or awaiting a decision, seeking the protection of a state under the terms of the refugee convention.",3
A refugee is a person who meets the definition of “refugee” in Article 1 of the refugee convention—they do not have to be recognised by a state to be a refugee—and so it follows that a “person with refugee status” is a person who meets the requirements under the UK Immigration Rules to be granted refugee status The term “economic migrant” is inexact.,4
"However, there will be people who meet the definition of Article 1 of the refugee convention but are looking to enter the UK and choosing it over other countries purely for economic reasons.",3
"One of the objectives of the New Plan for Immigration is to ensure that the most vulnerable can be protected, which in turn means that those attempting to enter the UK for economic reasons should use the appropriate routes Changes within Clause 28 via Schedule 3 are one in a suite of critical measures designed to break the business model of people smugglers and are the first step in disincentivising unwanted behaviours—for example, by dissuading those who are considering risking their lives by making dangerous and unnecessary journeys to the UK in order to claim asylum.",3
"By working to establish overseas asylum processing, we are sending a clear message to those who are risking their lives and funding criminal gangs both here and abroad or abusing the asylum system elsewhere that this behaviour is not worth it.",3
"We must make it easier to ensure that such people are simply not allowed to remain in the UK It also might assist noble Lords—and indeed my noble friend Lord Kirkhope of Harrogate—to know that for nearly 20 years, it has been possible under UK law to remove individuals from the UK while their asylum claim is pending if a certificate is issued under Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.)",3
"This is the real way to stop most of the dangerous channel crossings and put the smugglers out of business In the letter and attached chart that the Minister sent to the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and kindly made available to us all, the Government set out the current safe routes.",3
"Even under part 11 of the Immigration Rules, while adult refugees do not have to pay a fee for the visa they do have to pay for travel to the UK, and the integration loan cannot be used for that.",4
"Crucially, it would permit children recognised as refugees to sponsor their parents and siblings to join them.",3
"Not only does the visa cost almost £400 but the young sponsor has to show that they can financially support and accommodate their sibling without recourse to public funds, and that the justification for reunion is “serious and compelling”.",3
"Can the Minister tell us in her response when that guidance will be forthcoming, and how many visas have been issued under paragraphs 319X or 297 over the last five years I reaffirm my support for Amendment 113 from the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, and Amendment 117 from the noble Lord, Lord Dubs.",3
"These both aim to boost family reunion opportunities for unaccompanied minors and for entry to seek asylum, in part substituting for the loss of the Dublin regulation.",3
"The sources of many of our problems are war, famine and disease, and all of those things, so of course we have to prevent them However, it is also important in the debate we have in this country about asylum and refugees—not immigration—to stand up to the view that “We take the lot”.",2
"Sometimes the way that you change public opinion is by arguing with it People will say, as no doubt the Minister will, “We won the election and therefore this is what the public think”, but on asylum and refugees there is an argument for saying, “Of course we don’t want open borders but there is a need for us to act in a way that is compassionate and consistent with the values that we have always had”.",3
"To apply it to our own situation here, we will not deal with the migrant crossing problem in the channel without co-operation from France and the rest of Europe.",3
"Suggesting that other measures have or may have any deterrent effect is frankly not an answer when there is no international evidence, and the Home Office has recognised that asylum seekers often have no choice in how they travel and face exploitation by organised crime groups.",3
"If the Government want people to travel here by safe, alternative routes and break the business model of the people smugglers, their efforts need to be focused on providing those routes, which the three amendments I refer to do I will concentrate the rest of my remarks, which will be brief, on resettlement schemes.",3
"Initially, the Dubs scheme, passed into law by a Conservative Government, was envisaged to take 3,000 unaccompanied children who had fled unimaginable horrors and were travelling or in refugee camps on their own.",3
"Does the Minister accept that, without this route, some children will have turned, and will continue to turn, to people smugglers instead Our earlier Amendment 114, Amendment 116 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkhope of Harrogate, and my Amendment 119E all deal with a global resettlement scheme.",3
"This is to ensure the scheme is actually resettling people at the rates and numbers expected and is not simply announced in a press release then left to lie dormant or underperform Announcing the UK resettlement scheme, which was launched after the closure of the Syrian scheme, the then Home Secretary confirmed that “the UK plans to resettle in the region of 5,000 of the world’s most vulnerable refugees in the first year of the new scheme” Since that announcement, as I understand it, the scheme has settled less than a fifth of that number each year, with an annual average of 770 people.",3
"How do the Government expect the other 4,230 of the world’s most vulnerable refugees each year to travel here?",3
"We all want to stop dangerous journeys in small boats and avoid a repeat of the distressing events of 24 November last year in the channel, where 27 people tragically lost their lives.",3
"Together, EU countries operate the Common European Asylum System, which is a framework of rules and procedures based on the full and inclusive application of the refugee convention.",4
"They would create a new pull factor, motivating people to again entrust themselves to smugglers.",3
"While they might avoid the danger of a small boat, we know that journeys over land—for example, in the back of lorries—can be equally perilous.",3
"According to the latest published statistics, there were 4,070 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children being cared for in England.",3
"In 2019, the UK had the most asylum applications from unaccompanied children of all EU+ countries and had the second highest in 2020.",3
"The Government met their one-off commitment to transfer 480 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children —we did meet that commitment—from Europe to the UK under Section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016, which is referred to as the Dubs scheme.",3
"I am very grateful to the many local authorities who have been able to provide support on a voluntary basis to the national transfer scheme, introduced to enable the transfer of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from one local authority to another, which aims to deliver a fairer distribution of unaccompanied children across the UK.",3
"Due to the extremely high intake of unaccompanied children over recent months, particularly as a result of small boat crossings on the south coast, and pressures of entry on local authorities, the national transfer scheme has been unable to keep up with demand.",3
"The Government have mandated the national transfer scheme to ensure that we prioritise care placements for those unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who are in the UK Turning to Amendment 116, I understand the desire that Members of this Committee have to establish a minimum number of resettled refugees each year.",3
"This amendment seeks to bring in a statutory minimum of 10,000 refugees each year within one month of Royal Assent.",3
"We already have over 12,000 refugees and people at risk who we are in the process of resettling permanently and integrating into society I turn now to Amendments 118 to 119B.",3
"For resettlement, the UK works according to the humanitarian principles of impartiality and neutrality, which means that we do not take into consideration the ethno-religious origin of people requiring citizenship, as we resettle solely on the basis of need.",4
"My Lords, the effect of Clause 39 is to criminalise the act of seeking asylum in the UK, even if the person has no option but to flee.",3
"So having the temerity to arrive to claim asylum is considered multiple times more serious than enslaving and exploiting someone Clause 39 criminalising arrival would cover people intercepted in UK territorial waters and brought into the UK, and presenting themselves to an immigration official to claim asylum.",3
Note that this is not targeted at traffickers and smugglers but at the sorry individuals being smuggled and seeking asylum.,3
Remember that no visa exists for the purpose of claiming asylum—the noble Lord’s amendment wants to rectify that—and it is impossible to claim asylum without coming to the UK.,3
"It is a classic Catch-22 situation The clause is inconsistent with Article 31 of the refugee convention, which obliges signatories to “not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees … present in their territory without authorization, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.” This non-penalisation is at the core of the refugee convention—even Australia has never considered criminalising irregular entry Of course, if an asylum seeker becomes a criminal as soon as they arrive, this can have implications for their future as a refugee.",4
"They will have a criminal record and be deemed to be not of good character, and this will impact on their ability to integrate, to settle and, down the line, to acquire British citizenship As we discussed on an earlier group, the definition of “particularly serious crime” is being lowered to a 12-month sentence.",3
"Since they could get a four-year sentence under Clause 39, or 12 months on a summary conviction, the person could lose their protection against expulsion and refoulement simply as a result of arriving in the UK to claim asylum.",3
I may have got this wrong but perhaps the Minister will confirm that an example of that is someone transiting through Heathrow Airport who remains airside and then departs on another flight without going through immigration control.,3
"The UK border is the e-passport gates and the staffed Border Force control points, so someone transiting has clearly arrived in the UK but has not entered it, or at least they will not have entered the UK unless and until they have passed through the UK border.",4
"Similarly, those detained or granted immigration bail are not considered to have entered the UK even after they have left the immigration control area.",3
"With the change that the amendments seek to prevent, anyone who claims asylum in the UK territorial seas or at the UK border will be committing a criminal offence, whereas now they do not The Government have made much of the “first safe country” principle, which does not actually exist, wrongly interpreting it to mean that people cannot even transit through another country in order to claim asylum in the UK without their claim being deemed inadmissible.",3
"Even if an asylum seeker flies direct from a war-torn country, or a country where they are being persecuted, and arrives on a flight at Heathrow, for example, they will commit a criminal offence.",4
"Arguably, that is the case even if they have a visa or do not need one but arrive in the UK for a different purpose—that is, to claim asylum.",4
"For example, someone coming from a country where a visa is not required to visit the UK as a tourist for six months or less who then claims asylum at the UK border could be regarded as not having valid entry clearance, as they are allowed to enter the UK for the sole purpose of visiting as a tourist.",4
"As I said on a previous group when I drew the analogy with the misuse of drugs, almost all the provisions in the Bill are targeted at the users—asylum seekers, the victims of war, of persecution and of people smugglers—and not the real criminals of the piece, who are the dealers, or in this case the people smugglers.",3
Amendment 124 seeks to extend the statutory defence based on Article 31 of the refugee convention to any new offence—but the new offence should not stand part of the Bill.,3
"I am grateful to the noble Lord and the Joint Committee on Human Rights for drawing attention to this complex problem caused by changes in the way that people have sought to come to the UK through irregular routes, particularly through the use of small boats Many of the individuals involved are intercepted in UK territorial seas and brought into the UK because they are in distress and need help.",3
"The effect of this amendment is to prevent the prosecution of those arriving migrants who are visa nationals and whose actions mean that they did not and could not arrive in the UK and seek entry as required The UK is currently experiencing a serious problem of small-boat arrivals with migrants crossing from the continent, sometimes in the process recklessly and unnecessarily endangering themselves and others in small craft which are unseaworthy or wholly unsuitable for the crossing.",3
"The rescued migrants are generally brought to Dover, including pregnant women and children We need to reduce the allurement of the UK as a destination of choice for those who disregard readily available opportunities to seek refuge at earlier points in their journey, and thereby call into question their motives for travel to the UK.",3
"We wish to encourage migrants to apply for asylum in the first safe country they reach At this point, I want to be absolutely crystal clear about our intentions regarding the offence of arrival without entry clearance.",4
This offence will cover all asylum claimants who arrive without the necessary entry clearance.,3
"As a matter of law, refugees will be in scope of the offence, but decisions on prosecutions are a matter for the relevant UK prosecution body, which will take into account the public-interest test The noble Lord, Lord Coaker, asked whether every illegal entrant would be liable for prosecution the moment that they arrive in the UK.",3
This is not an attempt to prosecute every illegal entrant.,3
"Prosecutions will focus on egregious cases, such as cases where the individual has entered in breach of a deportation order or was previously removed as an illegal entrant or an overstayer.",3
"I am not persuaded that the breadth of this, which could criminalise everybody who arrives seeking asylum, is necessary.",3
The Minister has talked about egregious cases of people who were already deported as failed asylum seekers as well as smugglers and traffickers.,3
"The bottom line is that it is against the refugee convention, which I have read out, to penalise someone who seeks asylum.",3
"As others have said, Clause 39 in effect makes it impossible for someone to arrive to claim asylum without attracting the possibility of criminal penalty.",3
"That is, frankly, outrageous under refugee law and practice.",3
"The first, Amendment 124A, is about offences under Clause 39, which cover the majority of immigration offences.",3
"As the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, explained, if the Government are serious about going after the people smugglers, they need to protect the victims of those people smugglers so that those people can come forward and give evidence against them and convict them Amendment 140 is specifically about preventing the personal data of victims of, and witnesses to, domestic abuse from being used for any immigration control purpose.",3
"They are offences where there is universal agreement that more needs to be done to encourage victims and survivors to come forward, to charge those responsible and to convict the guilty I was a serving senior police officer when I was the victim of domestic violence and even I did not report it, so imagine what it must be like if victims or witnesses are also concerned, rightly or wrongly, about their immigration status, particularly where the perpetrator exploits those concerns to threaten the victim or witness that if she reports the abuse to the police, he will make sure that they are reported to the immigration authorities —let alone about the police passing on information unprompted by the suspect It is about priorities.",3
"I know that everything is a priority for this Government—whatever the Oral Question is about, the Answer is invariably “X is a priority”—but surely it is more important that a perpetrator of domestic violence and other unreported offences is convicted than that those instrumental in bringing the offender to justice are deported or removed.",3
"Of course, some might find that their concerns about their immigration status are unfounded, but you should not have to be a victim of crime to find that out The Government must do two things.",3
"First, they must not allow, as the amendments suggest, the personal data of migrant survivors of domestic abuse and other underreported crimes that are provided or used for the purposes of seeking or receiving support or assistance to be used for immigration control purposes Secondly, the Government should establish safe and confidential ways for people to establish their immigration status so that they can make informed decisions about taking steps to regularise their situation.",3
"Essentially, this group of amendments deals with and looks at the Government’s proposals to criminalise those who assist asylum seekers for no gain of their own, including potentially saving lives at sea and what colloquially we now call pushbacks Clause 40 would remove the words “and for gain” from Section 25A of the Immigration Act 1971.",3
"Presently, under Section 25A(1) it is an offence if a person “knowingly and for gain facilitates the arrival or attempted arrival in, or the entry or attempted entry” of an asylum seeker into the UK.",4
"The Government, showing some of the confusion that reigns around this part of the Bill, accepted that their original proposals could have criminalised the saving of lives at sea and introduced amendments on Report in the Commons to clarify that an offence is not committed if the act is done “by or on behalf of, or co-ordinated by … Her Majesty’s Coastguard” or an overseas equivalent.",3
"Facilitating entry for your personal gain—including, for example, monetary gain—targets this power on those who smuggle and traffic people as part of a business model.",3
"Are we certain that the clause, as it stands, means that anyone in any circumstances, who is not operating under the co-ordination of the coastguard or under any authority of the state but is simply sailing their boat, yacht or ship, can stop and help someone, even if that means facilitating a group of people in a dinghy who are on their way to the UK?",3
"Are the Government saying that this is fine Amendment 128, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh of Pickering, raises the question of what happens when the coastguard does not co-ordinate or ask for intervention but a boat assists people in distress at sea.",3
"We need to understand exactly what the Government are saying, and what they are saying to those who are in command of boats or ships and save lives at sea.",3
Is that illegal?,3
"We used to have civilised, reciprocal arrangements for the safe return of asylum seekers to neighbouring states, where appropriate.",3
"This group of amendments is so diverse and of such importance that I am left with no choice but to cover the ground comprehensively Amendment 125 seeks to prevent the change proposed in the Bill from targeting people smugglers who seek to exploit victims of war and persecution for profit to making it a criminal offence knowingly to facilitate the arrival, attempted arrival, entry or attempted entry into the United Kingdom of an asylum seeker, whether the person profits from the exercise or not.",3
"The only exemptions from the offence are where Her Majesty’s Coastguard—or a similar overseas organisation—or those acting on behalf of or co-ordinated by such an organisation are involved Can the Minister confirm that those on a vessel which by chance, unprompted, comes across a sinking boat filled with asylum seekers would have to seek permission from the coastguard before attempting to rescue and save the lives of those in danger of drowning—otherwise they would commit an offence I understand that new Section 25BA of the Immigration Act 1971 would provide a defence for the person charged with a facilitation offence.",3
When does an overloaded boat change from placing the occupants at risk to placing them in danger?,3
Does the boat have to start sinking before they can legally be rescued?,3
"Are the Government really saying in new Section 25BA(3) that a ship on its way to a UK port that picks up asylum seekers who are in danger of drowning and are 49% of the way across the Channel from France to England must divert to a French port because “the United Kingdom was not the nearest place of safety on land to which the assisted individual could have been delivered” This needs a serious rethink before we get to Report As my noble friend Lady Hamwee explained, Amendment 129A is about the penalty to be imposed for failure to secure goods vehicles and for carrying clandestine entrants, and seeks to probe whether there will be consultation on that penalty Clause 42 is about those working in UK waters, who are to be regarded as having arrived in or entered the United Kingdom by being in UK waters.",3
"Can the Minister explain how a UK enforcement officer can exercise powers in foreign waters or international waters, even against a foreign ship or a ship registered under the law of a relevant territory?",3
"Are the Government saying that an armed police officer who believes that he has been ordered—as in the case of Jean Charles de Menezes—to shoot a suspected suicide bomber, still retains legal responsibility for his actions, but the Border Force officers who push back and sink a boat containing asylum seekers who then drown are not legally responsible?",3
"In addition, tightening immigration controls, including ending European Union free movement, is believed to be having a detrimental impact on the UK economy and public services.",3
"Worker shortages in the National Health Service and social care, and shortages in the agriculture, hospitality and construction sectors, are all believed to be the result of changes made to the Immigration Rules since the end of the Brexit transition period A points-based immigration system may allow unlimited numbers of highly paid workers to enter the UK, but what about lower-paid but essential workers who are now excluded?",3
"Amendment 138 requires an independent report to be laid before Parliament on the impact on the UK economy and public services of changes to the Immigration Rules since December 2020, and further requires that the immigration control provisions in the Bill are not brought into force until that has been done As I have said in debate on previous groups, a decade ago, the Home Office was processing more than twice as many asylum claims as it is now but had fewer delays and fewer successful appeals against its decisions.",3
"For the record, in 2002, 84,132 people sought asylum in the UK and in 2019 it was 35,737.",3
There are also far fewer removals and far more illegal immigrants living in the UK than there were then.,3
It appears that the Home Office is less efficient and less effective than it was a decade ago Amendment 141 calls for an independent operations management review of the processing of asylum claims in the Home Office and of the removal mechanisms for those whose leave to remain has expired.,3
"But seriously, we need to understand why the Home Office is not as effective and efficient as it was The Minister repeatedly cites the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the ability of the Home Office to operate effectively, although the number claiming asylum dropped significantly because of Covid as well.",3
"If the hold-ups are due to the short-term impact of the pandemic, there is no need for all this draconian legislation aimed at reducing the numbers claiming asylum.",3
"We need to establish the real reasons for long delays in initial decisions, and for the failure to remove those whose asylum claims have failed The Minister talked about what people voted for in 2019, by which I presume she meant “taking back control of our borders”.",3
"Not only has visa-free entry from the EU and EEA countries continued since we left the EU, but citizens of 10 more countries have been added to those EU and EEA citizens who can now use the e-passport gates at airports, for example.",3
"Whereas before, these individuals would have had to supply the address of where they would be staying and demonstrate that they had sufficient funds to sustain them during their visit without working illegally, now they just waltz in, no questions asked.",3
"The report would have to contain information on those entering with or without a visa, the type of visa if they entered using one, and the number of such persons who have been removed.",3
"If there are too many immigrants in the UK—the facts are contested, and I accept that public opinion may not reflect the facts—the public need to know how many of these overstayers are the result of failed asylum claims and how many are overstayers for other reasons Taking back control of our borders does not mean throwing them open to even more people and taking no effective action to remove those who overstay.",3
Our contention is that asylum seekers are being unfairly targeted and stigmatised by this Government and this Bill.,3
"Amendment 193 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Rolfe, makes a similar point, although the data she would require to be published is itself targeted on asylum seekers Before we take drastic measures that target the 6% of immigrants to this country who are asylum seekers, we need to know what is going on with the other 94% and with the people—estimated to be over a million—who are no longer legally in the UK.",3
"My Amendment 193 would require the Secretary of State to ensure that information is regularly published on immigration, including data on both asylum and other immigration—just to clarify to the noble Lord, Lord Paddick—and also weekly figures on those entering the UK across the English Channel.",3
"I note that I might have drafted that more generously to include other sea routes used by small boats bringing migrants to the UK, as the dreadful people smugglers shift to any viable sea route I have tabled the amendment for two reasons.",3
"I need to understand from my noble friend the Minister what data the department is now collecting on immigration and asylum, how often this is published and how up to date it is when it is published.",3
"This matters, whatever your position on immigration.",3
"It is vital to have adequate provision of housing, schooling and other aspects of the care and employment of migrants.",2
"We also need to know how the population is growing or steadying Secondly, there have been reports in the media that the regular daily or weekly count of migrants crossing the channel might be discontinued, possibly as part of a move to give the Royal Navy control of enforcement.",3
"Brexit is an enormous change and we need to be sure that the flow of migrants—some welcome, some less so—is turning out as anticipated.",3
"My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, for tabling Amendment 138, which I will deal with first Before the introduction of the new points-based system, the Government commissioned the independent Migration Advisory Committee—the MAC—to advise, over three reports, on the impacts of EEA migration on the economy and society in the UK, how to align the immigration system with a modern industrial strategy, what best practice could be used to attract the skills from around the world that the UK labour market needs, and issues around salary thresholds in the context of the immigration system.",3
"When undertaking its work, the MAC looked at impacts on the economy and public services, as well as on the welfare of the resident population, as a matter of course In addition, the Home Office published detailed impact assessments for the main features of the new points-based system, setting out the policy objectives, intended effects and likely impacts, including for the skilled worker route, the global talent route and the graduate route Both the Home Office and the independent MAC keep the operation of the immigration system under regular review, and the Home Office will fully evaluate the new immigration system in due course.",3
"The MAC published its second annual report on 15 December, which looked at a range of topics, including the current labour market and the role of immigration.",3
"Making decisions quickly and accurately is in the best interests of the individual concerned, as well as representing value for money for the taxpayer and, where there is abuse of the immigration system, ensuring that it is dealt with effectively The Government do not think, however, that paying management consultants to look into these matters later this year is necessary, well timed or a good use of public money.",3
"We also publish immigration quarterly statistics, including on asylum and returns I turn to Amendments 141A, 191 and 193.",3
I can assure noble Lords that the Home Office publishes a whole range of immigration data on a regular basis and has done so for many years.,3
"We regularly publish statistics on data collected under the exit checks programme, which shows the proportion of people known to have left the country or obtained further leave to remain by the end of their visas.",3
"It cannot, however, show the number of people who have overstayed their visas, as they may have left the country and their departure has not been linked to their visa We regularly review the statistics that we publish as a department in line with the code of practice for statistics and, where it is clearly in the public interest to do so, we will publish new statistics and amend existing statistics to ensure that they continue to provide transparency around key government policies.",3
"We have recently announced our intention to publish a quarterly statistics report on irregular migration, which will include statistics on the number of people crossing the English Channel in small boats.",3
"The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, also asked for reassurance as to the steps taken to monitor the operation of each visa regime.",3
The UK keeps its visa regime under regular review.,3
"As part of this, we assess both visa national and non-visa national schemes in terms of risk and reward to UK interests, using data from a range of sources that span across immigration and national security interests The Government are committed to strengthening the security of our borders by ensuring that everyone who wishes to travel to the UK, except British and Irish citizens, has permission to do so before they travel.",3
"To fill the current gap in advance permissions, we will introduce an electronic travel authorisation scheme—the ETA scheme—which has been referred to already, for visitors and passengers transiting through the UK who do not currently need a visa for short stays or who do not already have an immigration status prior to travelling, which will be discussed in more detail on the last day of Committee Noble Lords further asked for details on how overstayers are tracked and monitored within the UK.",3
"The Home Office uses a multifaceted approach to tackling illegal migration, balancing the most effective measures with ensuring the proper and efficient use of taxpayers’ money.",3
"That is obviously due to travel restrictions being in place, among other things, including fewer scheduled airlines operating, and significant disruption to other services that support the removal of failed asylum seekers, such as court closures and delays Overstaying is against the law, unnecessarily costs the taxpayer money and is unfair on law-abiding migrants who come to the UK through the legal channels.",3
"This Bill and the wider New Plan for Immigration, the most comprehensive reform in decades, will provide the path to fixing this broken asylum and illegal migration system There will always be some who refuse to comply with the Immigration Rules without contact with the relevant authorities and I assure the Committee that the Home Office never gives up trying to trace those individuals and act against them.",3
"But this is not an issue of proof of identification; it is a much more holistic problem of the way in which they live and, perhaps, their lack of support and a certain level of alienation from wider society.",3
"Yes, that is more the case among some groups than others, and it would take some resources to engage in that kind of voter and citizenship education—not just among school-age children but among new migrants, including refugees who come to our country.",3
"Whichever side people were on in the referendum campaign, with suspicions of interference in elections by foreign powers—including foreign powers now tempting people possibly into another great European war—and during the difficult times of the pandemic and the difficult times now, with yet another refugee crisis, this is not the moment even to whisper a policy, let alone to legislate for one, that will lead people to feel that we are going in for a period of voter suppression We do not want to go down the American road on this.",3
"Many of us who are constitutional lawyers have, when studying, looked in admiration to many aspects of American notions of citizenship, but we should avoid voter suppression or putting hoops in people’s way, particularly those from more vulnerable communities, whether they are more recently arrived Britons, minority groups, the disabled or poor people.",3
They are both absolutely right that Russia’s pattern of military build-ups on the border of Ukraine and in illegally annexed Crimea are unacceptable and an attempt to destabilise Russia’s democratic neighbours and exert control over them.,3
"We have repeatedly exposed the reckless and dangerous activity of the Russian intelligence services, called out Russian malicious cyberactivity, and introduced a new power to stop individuals at the UK border to determine whether they are or have been involved in hostile state activity We have set out our plans to establish a register of beneficial owners for overseas entities that own UK property to combat money laundering and achieve greater transparency in the property market, and we have been clear about our intentions to significantly reform Companies House to strengthen our ability to combat economic crime The noble Lord asked about visas.",3
"The NCA has increased investigations into corrupt elites and we are currently reviewing all tier 1 investor visas granted before 5 April 2015, so action is going on there The noble Baroness asked about the registration of overseas entities.",3
We are planning a Bill that will ensure transparency for foreign-owned land in the UK; currently it is easily disguised through offshore companies We are taking action on multiple fronts to crack down on economic crime.,3
"I am concerned that the evil criminal gangs miss no opportunity to try to market a vision of coming to the United Kingdom, and I think there is a powerful dynamic to the issue of work in the conversations between the people smugglers and the individuals whose trade they seek to engage.",3
I think the best way to resolve this issue is to transform the casework to get it right so that this is not an issue in the first place Amendment 10B would create a new Dubs-style immigration rule to allow unaccompanied children in Europe who have UK family links to be admitted to the UK to claim asylum.,3
"This amendment creates a more favourable approach to refugee family reunion for those who are already in Europe, which is clearly unfair.",3
"Beyond that, these children would enter the asylum system upon arrival, which costs money to process, when our current family reunion rules are more generous and grant leave This is a single global approach to family reunion that does not encourage what are often dangerous journeys into Europe.",3
"If relationships break down, as does happen, these children would enter the care system as looked-after children, adding additional cost to the taxpayer when we currently have children in hotels awaiting care placements Additionally, subsection (1) could be interpreted more broadly, creating a risk that it would apply to a much broader group—at its broadest, requiring us to make provision for people of all ages to come to the UK to claim asylum.",3
Members have the opportunity to speak in this debate Lords amendment 11B focuses on setting a target for the number of refugees the UK would resettle each year.,3
Our view has long been that the number of refugees and people in need of protection we resettle each year must be based on our capacity and our assessment of the international situation.,3
"On Lords amendment 13B, I thank the other place for understanding that there is a need to be able to prosecute criminals who seek to evade immigration controls and return to the UK, but the amendment is too narrow in its scope, to the point where it would not allow for the prosecution of someone attempting to arrive in the UK who has previously been excluded from the UK on national security grounds.",3
Limiting the amended offence to cover only those who arrive in breach of a deportation order would also prevent the prosecution of arriving passengers in egregious cases when there are aggravating factors that show that prosecution is in the public interest.,3
"As such, the amendment would still compromise our plans to enhance the security of our borders and so we cannot accept it.",3
"However, by proposing Lords amendment 20B and replacing “for gain” with a statutory defence of “without reasonable excuse”, they would compromise our plans to enhance our ability to prosecute people smugglers.",3
"Rwanda is a state party to the 1951 refugee convention and the seven core UN human rights conventions, with a strong history of supporting refugees.",4
"Friend the Home Secretary made it clear yesterday that this partnership is the type of international co-operation that we need to make the global immigration system fairer, keep people safe, and give them opportunities to flourish.",3
"This is just one part of the system-wide reform that we promised to deliver in the new plan for immigration The objective of the Rwanda partnership announced last week is to create a mechanism for the relocation of individuals whose claims are not being considered by the UK—the inadmissible—to Rwanda, which will then process their claims.",3
"However, in future, we may wish to extend eligibility for overseas processing to those who have otherwise abused the UK’s asylum system, beyond undertaking dangerous or unnecessary journeys.",3
"That is the intention of this measure, which will make it easier for us to remove those who have pending asylum claims to another country for their claims to be processed Let me remind the House—I have set this out already, but it bears repeating—that the powers set out in clause 28 via schedule 3 are not new.",3
"For nearly 20 years, it has been possible under UK law to remove individuals from the UK while their asylum claim is pending if a certificate is issued under schedule 3 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004.",3
It is important to bear in mind that the asylum system is already very expensive.,2
"The Bill secures our borders, ensures that those who need our help will receive it and, as each of us here sincerely want, will save countless lives being risked crossing the channel each and every day when people traffickers realise that this is not a viable occupation for them any more.",3
"The reality is that this Bill is an exercise in damage limitation—in essence, an attempt by the Home Secretary to deal with the awful mess she has been making since she was appointed in 2019 The clauses on offshoring, inadmissibility, differential treatment and offence of arrival are symptomatic of a shambolic Government who have completely lost control of our asylum system to the extent that they are now seeking to dump their problems on a developing country that is 4,000 miles away and has a questionable record on human rights.",3
"Contrasting that with the £11,000 that it costs to process an asylum seeker here in the UK, we start to see the impact on the public purse The Prime Minister has said that he expects to send “tens of thousands” of asylum seekers to Rwanda per year, so we are looking at around £1 billion of taxpayers’ money spent by a Government who are doing absolutely nothing for British people hammered by the cost of living crisis.",3
"There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that the Rwanda plan will deter the people smugglers or the small boats, and there is therefore not a shred of evidence to demonstrate that it will deliver value for money To understand value for money, the Government must provide forecasts for a range of scenarios.",3
"The amendments provide that in order to offshore refugees to a third state, the Secretary of State must lay regulations specifying the identity of that state and have them approved by Parliament.",3
"There can be absolutely no doubt that the Government’s claim that Rwanda is a safe country for refugees will be challenged in the courts given that thousands of Rwandans seek asylum in Europe every year, with 76 Rwandan citizens granted asylum here in the UK since 2017.",3
"It is well worth noting that in 2019 Israel cancelled its offloading agreement with Rwanda after it emerged that the vast majority of refugees sent to Rwanda left within days of arriving there and after it was revealed that it had led to immense suffering, including subjecting vulnerable people to human trafficking It is highly likely that the Rwanda offloading plan will unravel because it is both eye-wateringly expensive and unworkable, but it is also deeply un-British—because the decision to outsource our problems to a developing country halfway across the globe with a questionable record on human rights just does not feel right.",3
"Labour Members have continually made the case that the Bill must meet Britain’s obligations under the 1951 UN refugee convention, and we are supporting Lords amendment 5B, which secures this Our country’s historical commitment to offering safe haven to refugees leads us to support a number of the other amendments before us today.",3
"First, we support Lords amendment 6B, which seeks to ensure that all refugees are given their convention rights and that family unity is maintained, even if the Government are determined to introduce the utterly inappropriate differential treatment aspect of this Bill, which, shamefully, contravenes the UN convention Secondly, we support Lords amendment 13B, which, if accepted, rather than criminalising Ukrainians and other desperate refugees who arrive here without clearance, would criminalise only those who have already been deported.",3
We should not be seeking to create a second class of refugee.,2
"Many of these people are desperate when they arrive on our doorstep, and the Government would do well to remember that Thirdly, we support Lords amendment 11B, which calls on the Home Secretary to set targets for taking in a number of refugees each year and would force her to finally do some medium-term planning rather than constantly scrambling to make it up as she goes along Fourthly, we support Lords amendment 10B, which provides for family reunion of unaccompanied refugees in Europe.",3
"My Lords, it is a great honour to open this debate on Her Majesty’s gracious Speech on the important issues of foreign affairs, defence and trade.",3
"This is the world we see around us today We are witnessing the illegal, and utterly brutal, invasion of Ukraine by the Putin regime.",3
"The integrated review identified Russia as a primary threat, and that has proved true.",3
"More broadly, we are reinforcing NATO allies understandably alarmed at the savagery occurring mere miles from their border.",3
"Closer to home, the Navy is now leading the operational response to small boats in the channel, ensuring control of our borders and cracking down on people smugglers Looking to the future, defence is modernising to counter these multiplying threats.",3
"The UK is introducing the most severe economic sanctions that Russia has ever faced, covering a record 1,600 individuals, entities and subsidiaries Putin can be in no doubt: his illegal war has strengthened European unity, strengthened NATO unity and strengthened the very idea of what it means to be Ukrainian.",3
"My Lords, on foreign affairs and how we might now best meet new challenges, a common theme runs through three issues: a well-focused yet adjusted defence strategy; a robust encouragement of improved educational opportunities worldwide; and a proactive international policy to achieve the better treatment of refugees and migrants Regarding a common factor between these issues and aspirations, I am glad that this debate will be replied to by my noble friend Lord Ahmad, for he is the Minister responsible for the United Kingdom’s continuing membership of the 46-state human rights affiliation of the Council of Europe, in which institution and in whose efficacy I, along with a great many of your Lordships, share a great deal of respect and confidence.",3
"Immediately now, how far can the design of such programmes also facilitate our present task of providing education here for Ukrainian refugee children?",3
"Positive developments include the integration of Ukrainians into our UK labour market, where workforce shortages exist At the same time, the UK is criticised for having concluded an agreement with Rwanda to cope with the significant increase in boat arrivals across the Channel.",3
"Will the Minister consider that greater mutual benefit could arise from organising and supporting UK employers, commerce and industry to recruit, in a targeted manner, foreign migrants and refugees before they embark on irregular routes to the UK in the first place?",3
"We have had problems on trucks, trains, coaches, ferries and air—and with people getting into small boats, as we all know—and there has been a trend.",3
"If it has settled down now, it is time to consider whether it is appropriate for the long-term future for these operators to continue to act basically as immigration officers on behalf of the Government.",3
"Perhaps she could respond on that one My main reason for raising the issue today is that I have come across a European Commission draft regulation, COM (2021) 753 final, which is trying to impose similar controls on the borders of the European Union and, equally, within its internal frontiers.",3
"It basically means that if these transport operators are carrying somebody defined as having entered the European Union illegally, and if the transport operator facilitates this movement across anywhere within Europe, the Commission can take action against the transport operator.",3
"That could cause British Airways, if it happened to be accused and found guilty of carrying one illegal immigrant from Berlin to London, to lose its licence to operate anywhere in the EU.",3
"I do not know whether the European Commission has tried to learn from the British regulations over the years and tried to make them a bit more stringent, but this could mean that if an operator—for example, P&O Ferries or Ryanair—transported an illegal immigrant, as they might be called, from the European Union to the UK, it would suffer twice.",4
"Whether she is or not, I hope the British Government will have discussions with the European Union to come up with some common policy on dealing with people who are either being smuggled or want to move between the UK and the European Union for whatever reason—that includes Ireland.",3
"I hope I have got it wrong and this does not happen, but this is an opportunity to debate the whole thing and it would be much better if the immigration department looked after immigration and the transport operators were allowed to get on with their jobs, which they are very good at.",3
"First, no country has been more big-hearted when it comes to those fleeing persecution, from Hong Kong British nationals overseas to the 17,000 who were evacuated out of Afghanistan and the 125,000-plus visas in relation to Ukraine.",3
Lady does not seem to care too much about that—in relation to the deportation of foreign national offenders.,3
"Lady not support common-sense reforms and a rebalancing of the system to allow us to stand up for victims, stand up for the public and remove serious foreign criminals?",3
"I was one of those who shared the frustrations of my constituents in Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke when we saw the Rwanda flight grounded and the deportation of foreign national offenders frustrated, which is why I was one of those who openly said that we should withdraw from the European convention on human rights.",3
"Friend at the Dispatch Box for the people of Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke that this Bill of Rights will help the deportation of foreign national offenders and illegal economic migrants who come from safe mainland Europe?",3
"I also thank a host of civil society experts who have helped me—too many to name—but I give special thanks to Professor John Heathershaw of Exeter University, Adam Hug of the Foreign Policy Centre and Sue Hawley of Spotlight on Corruption Earlier this week, the Foreign Secretary announced welcome moves to toughen up the sanctions regime against Russia, but we should not be waiting for a potential military crisis before we act against illicit finance at home and corruption overseas.",3
"We should act and use the powers we have now Today, I want to shine a light on foreign corruption in another state, not simply because that is important in itself, but because I want to highlight the UK’s role in facilitating shameful wrongdoing.",3
"Secondly, now that they have committed to tabling an economic crime Bill in the next Session, they must ensure the Bill’s provisions are fit for purpose, tough, effective and appropriate so that Britain can show by what we do that we are seriously committed to fighting the scourge of dirty money It is 30 years since Kazakhstan, a multi-ethnic, resource-rich central Asian state, emerged from the disintegration of the Soviet Union.",3
"Between 2008 and 2015, we issued 205 Kazakh kleptocrats with golden visas to settle with their dirty money in the UK, which was the fifth most common country for users of the Tier 1 Investor scheme.",3
"We have opened our borders, our property market and our financial structures to the Kazakh ruling class, enabling them to launder their illicit wealth and spend it.",3
"Our lack of transparency over foreign property ownership, our lax regulatory regime and our weak enforcement agencies have all aided and abetted the Kazakh elite.",3
"They allow us to designate foreign, corrupt actors, freeze their UK assets, stop them entering Britain and limit their access to our financial or legal enablers.",3
"With swift action, we can begin to restore the idea of a good global Britain and demonstrate to our allies that we will not provide a safe haven for kleptocrats or oligarchs I ask the Minister whether he will consider the individuals I have named and impose sanctions on those who have stolen from their country, laundered their money here, used UK structures to hide their ill-gotten gains, used the golden visa route to gain entry to the UK or committed human rights abuses.",3
"The Statement is as follows: “With permission, I would like to make a Statement about the Government’s world-leading migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda The British people have repeatedly voted for controlled immigration and the right to secure borders.",4
"Last night, we aimed to relocate the first people from our country who arrived here through dangerous and illegal means, including by small boats.",3
"But our capacity to help those most in need is compromised by those who come here illegally and jump the queue because they can afford to pay the people smugglers It is illegal, and it is not necessary; they are coming from other safe countries.",2
"It makes us less safe, because those who come here illegally do not have proper background checks and because evil people-smuggling gangs use the proceeds of their ill-gotten gains to fund other wicked crimes.",2
It is also lethally dangerous for those who are smuggled.,2
The global asylum system is broken.,2
"This partnership sends a clear message that illegal entry will not be tolerated, while offering a practical, humane way forward for those who arrive in the UK via illegal routes.",3
Rwanda is a safe and secure country with an excellent track record of supporting asylum seekers.,4
We will not accept that we have no right to control our borders.,2
"We will do everything necessary to keep this country safe and we will continue our long, proud tradition of helping those in genuine need I have met refugees, both abroad and on British soil.",4
"I am the first to say that controlled immigration is good for this country, including immigration by refugees, but we simply have to focus our support on those who most need and deserve it and not on those who have picked the UK as a preferred destination over a safe country such as France.",2
"It is no use pretending they are fleeing persecution when they are not Our capacity to help is not infinite, and public support for the asylum system will be fatally undermined if we do not act.",2
The critics of the Rwanda partnership have no alternative proposal to deal with uncontrolled immigration.,3
I promise to look carefully at any proposal to reduce illegal entry that the Benches opposite might care to suggest.,3
"Meanwhile, the Government want to get on with delivering what the British people want: an immigration system that is firm and fair.",3
She refused to answer questions about whether those intended for yesterday’s failed flight included victims of torture or trafficking or people who have fled Afghanistan.,3
"The Home Secretary has also refused to confirm her support for the European Convention on Human Rights, which Britain helped to draft and proudly ratified decades ago Yesterday, on the day when Ministers were insisting that a flight with fewer than seven asylum seekers would take off, come what may, over 400 people risked their lives to cross the channel.",3
"We need serious co-operation with our close neighbours in France to take action on the border, and dedicated action against criminal gangs.",3
Can the Minister confirm that a number of people who were due to be on the flight were removed by the Home Office itself because officials knew that there were problems with the cases The Home Secretary has made it clear that she considers those fleeing Afghanistan and Ukraine deserving of asylum in the UK.,3
Can she give a guarantee that no person who has fled from Ukraine will be deported by this Government to Rwanda?,3
"Of course, a Government have a right to police their borders.",4
"Can the Minister confirm that that is the case, and that government policy is that the NCA will not be asked to make any cuts Earlier, the Home Secretary herself said that, on this Government’s watch, asylum costs “are soaring”.",3
"Under the current leadership, the number of basic decisions taken by our asylum system has collapsed from 28,000 a year to just 14,000 a year.",3
"Is that what this has come to—saying that we will get rid of the European Convention on Human Rights because we do not like it any more Lastly, is this really the image of our country that we want beamed across the world: deportation flights from a guarded RAF base because the policy is so unpopular?",3
"My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement The Home Secretary began her Statement by saying: “The British people have repeatedly voted for controlled immigration” This Government have dramatically increased immigration into this country, allowing visa-free entry from even more countries while retaining visa-free entry for those from the European Union.",3
"The National Audit Office estimates that between 600,000 and 1.2 million illegal immigrants are in the UK.",3
"In 2010, there were more than 10,000 removals of those illegally in the UK; in 2021, it was 113.",3
Why are the Government increasing immigration and reducing removals The Home Secretary talked about “intolerable pressure” being placed on public services.,3
"In 2019, the Government allowed 680,000 economic migrants and foreign students into the country, while the number claiming asylum in the same year was 41,700.",3
Only 6% of all long-term international migrants in 2019 were asylum seekers.,3
How much pressure are asylum seekers placing on the system compared with other migrants The Home Secretary said that she welcomed the decision of domestic courts and blamed the European Court of Human Rights for grounding the flight to Rwanda.,3
"Reportedly, 130 asylum seekers were issued with notice of removal to Rwanda and the European Court of Human Rights removed three asylum seekers from the plane.",3
How many asylum seekers won their cases in domestic courts The Home Secretary talked about it costing £5 million a day to house asylum seekers.,3
The Rwandan authorities say that it will cost about the same to house a refugee in Rwanda as it does in the UK.,3
"It is because since Priti Patel became Home Secretary, the number awaiting a decision on their asylum application, unable to work and reliant on the state has trebled.",3
"What will the cost be for those removed to Rwanda compared with those who stay in the UK The Home Secretary said that Rwanda was being terribly misrepresented, that it was in fact a safe and secure country with an outstanding record when it comes to supporting asylum seekers, and that those removed to Rwanda will be given generous support, language training, and help to find jobs and to set up their own businesses.",3
"Leaving aside a dozen asylum seekers reportedly having been shot when they protested about conditions in Rwanda, if Rwanda is such a desirable location, how is threatening to remove asylum seekers, and only some asylum seekers, to Rwanda, supposed to deter those crossing the channel Some 75% of the people affected by this Government’s policy of deporting asylum seekers, based on those crossing the channel whose claims are processed in the UK, are genuine seekers of sanctuary who have the right to settle in the UK under the UN refugee convention.",3
A Rwandan government spokesperson said today on Sky News that Rwanda does not have the facilities to care for these kinds of vulnerable asylum seekers.,3
What will happen to these particularly vulnerable asylum seekers?,3
"Will they be returned to the UK and, if so, at what cost, both emotionally to the victims, and to the taxpayer The UK must take its fair share of asylum seekers and not export our legal and moral responsibilities to Rwanda.",3
"In 2020, the UK had six applications for asylum per 10,000 population, while EU countries on average had 11.",3
"In 2002, over 84,000 people claimed asylum in the UK and in 2019 it was less than 36,000.",3
The asylum system is broken because this Government broke it.,2
"This is a very different narrative to that pushed by some politicians and commentators, mainly but not all on the right of politics, who have spent years criticising and misrepresenting the convention, the Strasbourg court—which gets confused with the EU court, deliberately or negligently—and the Human Rights Act, which incorporated the convention into UK law These human rights instruments have been demonised as benefiting only criminals, illegal immigrants and the generally undeserving.",3
"It has ushered in—not least through the positive obligations provision that the Bill of Rights will undermine—a culture of respecting human rights in hospitals, schools, care homes, local government, housing providers and the criminal justice system, helping to ensure that people who may be vulnerable are given the support they need to flourish and thrive Most recently, the Government whinged mightily about the interim measures—a sort of injunction—from the European Court of Human Rights to put a hold on Rwanda deportation flights until the UK courts substantively determine their legality.",3
"The families used the HRA to challenge the Government and in 2013, the Supreme Court ruling that soldiers do not lose their rights when fighting overseas prompted an apology from the Ministry of Defence and a commitment to no longer use them.",3
"That is being misrepresented by people opposite It now seems that the Government are intent on ripping up the HRA and introducing this new, weaker, so-called Bill of Rights in order, sinisterly, and among other things, to make it harder for asylum seekers to make Britain their home Despite the best efforts of the right-wing press to convince us otherwise, the court in Strasbourg and the convention were not designed by some European Union bureaucracy; they were designed by us, as others have so rightly said.",3
Article 8 protects the right to respect for family life and has been successfully used to prevent the deportation of migrants and refugees when it has been deemed that deportation would put their family members at risk.,3
"For days, the Home Secretary has lagged behind the demands from the public, from Parliament and even from within her own party For Ukrainians who are already here, instead of a piecemeal visa extension, can we have a comprehensive extension of all visas for at least a year?",3
Theirs is a very typical case that Members on both sides of the House will have to deal with The simple and just response is to waive visa requirements for Ukrainians and to offer comprehensive protection.,3
"If our European allies can do it, so can we The Home Secretary’s letter to MPs this morning said that those who do not fit the family criteria can apply ordinarily under the points-based immigration system.",3
"Indeed, we share an open land border with Ireland, which has just made the very move that we are suggesting.",3
"Whether it is 100,000 or 200,000, these are complete and utter works of fiction designed to get the Home Office out of a hole Finally, the Home Secretary mentioned her awful anti-refugee Bill.",3
How can she justify legislation that would criminalise Ukrainians who arrive here seeking asylum outside the scheme she announced today?,3
"My Lords, if those seeking asylum in the UK are genuine seekers of sanctuary from war and persecution, they are entitled to all the rights afforded to refugees under the refugee convention.",4
"Even if they are eventually found not to be genuine refugees, they are entitled to have their claim considered and their welfare safeguarded while it is being considered.",3
"In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Horam, who appears to think that this is all about people crossing the channel, Clause 11 would make Ukrainian refugees who made it to Poland and then flew to the UK second-class refugees.",3
"If—I say “if”; I am not saying that this is the case—there is concern in public opinion, it is a concern about immigration, not a concern about refugees This is a very generous nation.",4
"They are concerned about being overwhelmed by immigrants, but only 6% of immigration in recent years has been by asylum seekers.",3
"Once asylum seekers have presented themselves and their claim in the UK, they are entitled to have their claim considered without fear or favour, regardless of where they came from and how they got here.",4
"Under Clause 11, those who meet the terms of the refugee convention will be granted refugee status.",3
There is no question of this clause making it harder to be a refugee or otherwise enabling the Government to refuse refugee protection to those who need it.,3
"What the clause does is enable the Secretary of State to distinguish between refugees based on whether they came directly and claimed without delay, but anyone considered under this policy will be a refugee The status of Clause 11, as a deterrent, is closely tied to secondary movements and the first safe country principle.",3
"In Committee it was claimed that, for a number of reasons, the UK must allow people to choose to come here from other safe countries to claim asylum, if they wish.",3
It has also been posited that requiring refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country would undermine the global humanitarian and co-operative principles on which the refugee system is founded.,3
"Quite simply, if spontaneous intake falls, our ability to bring over refugees from regions of origin increases I will also reiterate at this stage that the first safe country principle is itself internationally recognised.",3
"Not only does it underpin the Common European Asylum System but there is a long-standing safe third country agreement between the USA and Canada which means that, barring certain exceptions, anyone arriving at the Canadian border is ineligible to make a claim.",4
"As my noble friend Lord Horam might have mentioned, Norwegian legislation similarly sets out that an application for asylum may be refused where a person has travelled to Norway after having stayed in a place where they did not face persecution.",4
"Australia—much mentioned this evening—also has those statutory powers to designate countries as safe, with the effect that anyone from that place will be barred from claiming asylum.",3
"In Australia, they have almost entirely stopped small boat crossings The evidence on which such policies are based is not only the fact that certain safe countries are clearly more popular than others as a destination for asylum seekers but comes from academic analysis.",3
"An important part of their conclusion was that “future possibilities” play a crucial role in explaining secondary movements: “For the individual migrant, it makes sense to ask: ‘If I make it through the waiting period and if I gain protection in this country—will I have the means to survive here?",3
"However, every last one of those things can be found in France and other safe countries without the need for a dangerous journey to the UK Another study concerning secondary movements of Eritreans between Italy and Norway by Brekke and Brochmann in 2014 noted the following: “National differences in the quality of the reception system, in welfare policies, and in labour market opportunities motivated the secondary migration of asylum seekers and refugees in Italy.” They also observed: “The UK, Norway, and Sweden stood out as attractive destinations for the Eritreans.",3
"We must do everything within our powers to stop this, including putting Clause 11 into law Briefly, the “without delay” element of Clause 11 is intended simply to deter other unwanted behaviours that we see in the asylum system.",3
"This includes making late claims without reasonable excuse, often in response to a negative immigration decision to delay removal.",3
"This is intended primarily to improve operational efficiency, enabling us to focus resources on those most in need and to carry out quick and cost-effective returns of those who have no right to be in the UK Distinguishing between different refugees forms part of the refugee convention itself.",3
"For example, the entire structure of entitlement under the refugee convention rests on different levels of attachment, with physical presence and lawful presence distinguished for the purposes of various entitlements.",3
Article 31 does not contain a blanket prohibition on the imposition of penalties on refugees who enter or are present illegally.,3
"Article 31 prohibits penalties only in respect of refugees who either are coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened or present themselves without delay to the authorities, and who show good cause for their illegal entry or presence We think that differentiation is not a penalty, taking into account that the convention does not explicitly define “penalty” and the fact that there is no unanimity on the definition of penalty.",3
"In any event, the convention does not prohibit differentiation and the clear implication of Article 31 is that states are entitled to impose penalties on refugees who enter their territory illegally when the three conditions are not satisfied.",3
"This goes to my noble friend Lady Stowell’s point: despite a number of misleading media and NGO reports, there is a vanishingly low risk that anyone who has, for example, suffered sexual or gender-based violence, is coming to terms with their sexuality or is the victim of trafficking will face differentiated entitlements.",3
"Indeed, there is no obligation to impose any particular condition on group 2 refugees.",3
There is ample room for people to show that they could not reasonably have been expected to claim asylum in another safe country or that they could not claim as soon as reasonably practicable Group 2 refugees will still be protected and receive relevant entitlements in accordance with the refugee convention so that the object and purpose of the convention are upheld.,3
"Accordingly, Clause 11 is considered a good faith, compatible interpretation of the refugee convention My noble friend Lady McIntosh of Pickering lamented the diminution of safe and legal routes.",3
"Some of those routes are not capped—for example, the BNO and refugee family reunion routes.",3
"Potentially 100,000 Ukrainian refugees will come here, and we will be very glad to see them.",3
"On the point about visa waivers, I think it is very important that we continue to have the simple security checks that my right honourable friend talks about, because there is evidence that people who would do us harm are masquerading as Ukrainian refugees Just to finish, I have a point on Jordan, which I think the noble Lord, Lord Russell of Liverpool, mentioned.",3
"This clause strikes a robust balance between firmness and fairness, with a firm policy response to the evidential picture about secondary movements and upholding the first safe country principle, but fair in its acknowledgement that we absolutely must be sensitive to the vulnerabilities of certain asylum seekers.",3
The issue has been much debated and it hinges on two issues really: the integrity of our immigration system and pull factors.,2
"I want to correct a figure that has been mooted a couple of times this evening: there are actually 81,000 people awaiting an initial decision, not 125,000, but it is a large number nevertheless A more relaxed asylum seeker right to work policy creates a back door into our labour market.",3
"However, we cannot afford to turn around and offer people the opportunity to undercut it through simply lodging an asylum claim.",3
"As my noble friend Lady Stowell said, someone who comes to the UK and is found working illegally can claim asylum as a way to prevent removal and then get the right to work.",4
"That does not seem logical to me I will repeat that, where reasons for coming to the UK include family or economic considerations, applications should be made via the relevant route: either the points-based immigration system or our various family reunion routes.",4
That is why we cannot discount the risk of even more channel crossings if we relaxed our asylum seeker right-to-work policy.,3
"However, I want to be clear that the motivations for fleeing one’s country of origin—of which noble Lords are well aware—and the motivations for moving from one safe country to another are not the same According to a 2009 article by Norwegian academics Jan-Paul Brekke and Monica Aarset, there is a hierarchy of considerations which migrants make when choosing a particular country.",3
"The solution here is to decide cases more quickly, and that is what we are doing through the wider new plan for immigration.",3
"In light of the fact that 73% of people thought that illegal channel crossings were a serious issue, 50% of people thought that the UK does not have a responsibility to protect people—against 35% who thought that they did.",3
"In addition, 65% of people thought that Britain should refuse to accept asylum applications, and 55% thought that the current approach of the Government to small boats was too soft.",3
"I say that this Government have a clear mandate to ensure that there is no incentive for people to make secondary movements across the channel where academic evidence suggests that many do it for primarily economic reasons The noble Baroness, Lady Lister, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford talked about addressing the integration needs of asylum seekers.",3
"Of course, that is absolutely true, but not all of those who seek asylum are found to need international protection.",3
"As the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, said, 50% of asylum seekers are refused even after appeal, so that spells that out.",3
"Challenges need solutions, not just complaints about what is proposed Managing migration—welcoming and effectively supporting those most in need, while protecting borders and closing down the dangerous business of people-smuggling—is one of the most difficult public policy challenges faced by any Government.",3
Breaking the business model of the people smugglers and managing the flow of people entering this country is one of the most humane things that we can do.,2
"As I have said to this House, it is very important that in cases where we have already made a decision to deprive, the subsequent deprivation order remains valid and effective to protect the UK from high-harm individuals and to preserve the integrity of the immigration system; that is the purpose of this clause.",3
"I very much welcome the spirit of this amendment, but unfortunately it could still compromise our ability to prosecute people smugglers because it is still open to exploitation from organised crime gangs involved in people-smuggling, who could very easily manipulate circumstances to deliberately endanger migrants’ lives, as they do now, by providing inadequate craft in which to cross the Channel, and then provide their own rescue as a means to avoid prosecution.",3
Foreign nationals who choose not to be referred into the NRM and are therefore subject to a duty to notify are likely to be already engaged in parallel with the immigration system.,3
"Reasonable grounds decisions, conclusive grounds decisions and, in future, public order disqualification decisions will continue to be taken separately from any consideration of an individual’s immigration status I want to be clear that first responders should always refer victims into the NRM, in line with modern slavery statutory guidance, using the online form, even when the individual may meet the public order definition.",3
"We are committed to improving the training of first responders to increase awareness of the NRM and ensure that potential victims can make informed decisions about whether to enter the system, and we are supporting that with an improved legal aid offer for victims of trafficking within the Bill We recognise that those individuals who have prior convictions may be more frequently targeted by the exploiters.",3
"If British people, as we are constantly told, are concerned about immigration, this Bill, which targets asylum seekers and victims of modern slavery, is not focused on their primary concern In an article in the Telegraph yesterday, Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former chief of staff, wrote about his concerns about mass immigration.",3
"Nowhere in that article does he mention asylum seekers, victims of modern slavery or the Nationality and Borders Bill.",3
"He points to the real causes of mass immigration: 240,000 work visas, up 25% compared with 2019, which was a big year for immigration; 280,000 family visas, up 49%; and 430,000 student visas, up 52%.",3
These numbers dwarf the numbers claiming asylum Work permits have become unlimited; the definition of a skilled worker has been watered down; the shortage occupation list has been extended; employers no longer have to prove that they could not recruit from the resident population; and foreign students are allowed to stay on after their studies no matter what their qualification.,3
"An Australian-style points-based system, designed to increase immigration into Australia, is having the same effect here, despite the end of free movement.",3
"Yet this Government, and this Bill, address none of these issues but instead focus on the small minority fleeing war, persecution and modern slavery, who desperately need sanctuary On Motions A and A1, we believe that the safeguards the noble Lord, Lord Anderson of Ipswich, has secured in relation to deprivation of British citizenship without notice will ensure that further abuse of the system is prevented.",3
"While we have sympathy with the position of the noble Baroness, Lady D’Souza, we are pleased that she is not going to divide the House on this occasion On Motions K and K1, I understand the Government’s determination to prosecute people smugglers but the unintended consequences of removing the “for gain” element of the offence of facilitating the entry of an asylum seeker into the United Kingdom are to subject individuals, most importantly those seeking to rescue migrants drowning in the channel, to prosecution The first amendment approved by this House to reinstate “for gain” was a Labour amendment.",3
"This third attempt would mean that individuals engaged in genuine humanitarian activity, including the preservation of life, would not commit an offence This is about removing doubt from the minds of those who come across drowning migrants in the channel that they may be prosecuted if they effect an immediate rescue.",3
"The Government’s position remains that the provisions of this Bill are compliant with the refugee convention, but I cannot support the amendment, as it strikes at the heart of the constitutional relationship between Parliament and the courts.",3
"These provisions are clear and unambiguous and are a good faith interpretation of the refugee convention The new amendment is not only unnecessary because the contents of Part 2 are fully compliant with our international obligation; it is also contrary to the fundamental purpose of this Bill, which is, where possible, to tightly define the nature of our obligations under the refugee convention while remaining complaint with those obligations to support consistent and accurate decision-making Amendments 6D, 6E and 6F are another attempt to alter the effectiveness of the differentiation policy.",3
"Turning first to Amendment 6D, it is important to note that Clause 36, which is relevant to the criteria used to differentiate under Clause 11, already provides that an individual may still be treated as having “come directly” even if they stopped in another country outside the United Kingdom, provided they can show that they could not reasonably have been expected to claim asylum in that country.",3
"Clause 36 also allows discretion to be exercised in determining whether someone claimed “without delay”, whether that person claimed as soon as it was “reasonably practicable” being a key factor to be considered when assessing these criteria and therefore again being relevant in determining a refugee’s grouping.",3
"First, I assure noble Lords that my officials are developing detailed guidance for decision-makers to assess the credibility of a person making an asylum claim and, where a claimant qualifies for refugee status, whether they are in group 1 or group 2.",3
The guidance will outline that all claimants will be afforded the opportunity to rebut a provisional decision to identify an individual as a group 2 refugee.,3
"As is currently the case, we will continue to support claimants throughout the process to ensure that they are able to present the evidence substantiating their asylum claim, and this includes in relation to whether they are a group 1 or group 2 refugee.",3
"Although Home Office officials will continue to provide this support, it is not for the Secretary of State, but instead for the claimant, to demonstrate whether they are a group 1 or group 2 refugee.",3
"Changes to the Immigration Rules will be made in order to operationalise the differentiated asylum system, as well as other provisions within the Bill.",3
Section 2 of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 already sets out the primacy of the refugee convention in the Immigration Rules.,3
"It states: “Nothing in the immigration rules (within the meaning of the 1971 Act) shall lay down any practice which would be contrary to the Convention.” I must remind noble Lords that it is our unwavering position that all provisions in Part 2, including Clause 11, are compliant with our obligations under the refugee convention, but Section 2 of the 1993 Act will continue to act as an additional safeguard for policies covered in the Immigration Rules, and as such it does not need to be referenced within the Bill The amendment is also unnecessary as the best interests of child already are and will continue to be considered as part of the asylum decision-making process.",3
"In addition, access to family reunion will be available to all group 1 refugees and group 2 refugees where a refusal would be in breach of their Article 8 ECHR rights, in line with our international obligations I turn next to Amendments 7F and 7G.",3
"These are nearly identical to previous Amendments 7B and 7C and, like those previous amendments, they would not only reward people who have in many cases arrived illegally in an attempt to undermine our economic migration system but would create enormous operational burdens for the Home Office to implement, very likely—as per the findings of the Government’s review into the policy—leading to a net yearly loss to the department in running costs.",3
We are making every effort to ensure this is a reality under the wider new plan for immigration.,3
The first safe country principle is widely recognised internationally and is a fundamental feature of the common European asylum system.,3
"By enforcing this part of the Bill, we are taking the battle to the people smugglers, showing them that their horrible business will be made unviable.",3
This ground-breaking partnership addresses the international challenge of irregular migration by disrupting the business model of organised crime gangs and deterring migrants from putting their lives at risk.,3
"Those making dangerous, illegal or unnecessary journeys to claim asylum in the UK may now be relocated to Rwanda, where their claims will then be processed I should be clear that the objective of the UK-Rwanda partnership is to create a mechanism for the relocation of individuals whose claims are not being considered by the UK—the inadmissible—to Rwanda.",3
"In future, we may want to extend eligibility for overseas processing to those who have otherwise abused the UK’s asylum system, beyond undertaking dangerous or unnecessary journeys.",3
"That is the intention of this measure, which will make it easier for us to remove those who have pending asylum claims to another country for their claims to be processed At this point, I should say something about the partnership agreement.",3
"Rwanda is a state party to the 1951 UN refugee convention and the seven core UN human rights conventions, with a strong history of supporting refugees.",4
"By way of example, in 2019, the UNHCR and the African Union signed an MoU with Rwanda to establish an emergency transit mechanism; this partnership facilitates the relocation of refugees and asylum seekers from the conflict zones in Libya to the safety of Rwanda.",3
"There is nothing novel, unusual or untoward about underpinning this arrangement with an MoU, the terms and monitoring mechanism of which give us the assurances we need to operate this arrangement safely and in line with our international obligations Outside the partnership, noble Lords need look no further than the safety criteria set out in these measures to be assured that we will only ever remove someone whose asylum claim is pending to a safe third country where it is in accordance with the refugee convention and the European Convention on Human Rights.",3
"It would be a boost for the Treasury, for recruiters and, not least, for asylum seekers themselves.",3
"However, the Government appear to want to maintain a ban on employment for asylum seekers, even after the introduction of their offshoring policy.",3
"If such a correlation, or even causation, existed, asylum migration would look very different from how it does today.",2
"Certainly, 28,000 refugees would not have risked their lives crossing the channel in boats in 2021 to come to the UK, where they cannot work; they would have headed to Sweden, which received just 10,000 applications for refugee status, even though asylum seekers can work after day one The 62,000 people who claimed asylum in Spain last year, where they must wait for six months to work, would have simply crossed the border into Portugal, whose 1,300 asylum applicants can get a job after one week.",3
"The people who applied for asylum in France—over 100,000 of them—where they must wait six months to work, could have just stopped in, or headed to, Italy, where they can work after two months.",3
"That some countries with stricter labour access laws often receive more asylum seekers, while, in many cases, fewer refugees go to countries with more relaxed rules around work, shows the lack of link between application numbers and employment rules.",3
It leaves asylum seekers in poverty and institutionally dependent; it leaves businesses up and down the country without extra hands at a time of record job vacancies; it takes a terrible toll on people’s mental health; and it damages any attempt at integration and future employment success It should not be so hard to reach agreement on a policy that has so much cross-party support and so many benefits.,3
"In particular, it is almost certainly the case that there are not enough legal routes for genuine refugees to this country.",2
"I recognise what the Minister said about the extent to which we have already accommodated refugees and the figures she quoted, but I still think that we do not have enough legal routes for the generality of refugees, leaving aside those from Hong Kong, the Afghans and Syrians and so forth The noble Lord, Lord Paddick, made the point very well on the previous group of amendments that if we compare the number of asylum seekers to the number of economic migrants—the number of work visas, for example—that is the real problem: in numbers.",3
"It is numbers I am concerned about principally and not the number of asylum seekers, which is comparatively small.",3
"I would trade a reduction in the number of economic migrants—people taking work visas, particularly the golden visas we have heard about more recently as a result of the Ukraine war—for an increase in the number of legal routes for genuine asylum seekers.",3
I would do it on the simple humanitarian grounds that some people need legal routes more than purely economic migrants But the problem with that argument is that it only goes so far.,3
"First, there is the capacity to absorb new immigrants, given where we are with a large number of work visas, family visas and undergraduate visas each year and, on top of that, the Ukrainians, those from Hong Kong and the rest, and particularly as most immigrants go into the poorer areas of our country.",3
"If you read about or experience, as I have done as a former Member of Parliament, the effect on housing, schooling and GPs in the poorer areas of this country of a rapidly increasing number of immigrants over quite a short period, you can see the anger and despair of ordinary British people dealing with this situation.",3
"You cannot leave that out of account, particularly when one of the Government’s major objectives is the levelling-up agenda, which is precisely to help those areas most affected by the number of immigrants coming into the country, whether those are the large number of economic migrants or the smaller number of genuine refugees Finally on this point, however many legal routes we may have, we will not stop the traffickers in human beings just by having more legal routes.",3
"That is why we have this Bill; we need to tackle that problem directly I fully agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, and the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, on the important point they made about the 2001 refugee convention.",3
"He may not agree with him, but he was certainly persuasive in his full and detailed account of the Government’s position and why what they are doing remains within the refugee convention.",3
"Throughout the long development of their offshoring policy—it took two or three years; this is not something that will be resolved here overnight, perhaps not even in a year or two—they made a point of having a dialogue with the UNHCR, which is the guardian of the refugee convention.",3
"Something like that would be a means of discussion whereby we do not just talk at each other across the Chamber and in the newspapers, but talk seriously about this very important problem, which any Government of whatever description would have to resolve—namely, these illegal boat trips across the channel.",3
"That is why these amendments are so important Very briefly, on Motion C1, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, and my Motion J1, which essentially deal with the same thing—the offence of arrival and the differential treatment—the Government and the Commons have failed to answer how on earth anybody can claim asylum in this country if they arrive here through an irregular route.",3
They cannot; they are automatically assumed to be illegal.,3
"We are saying to the Government: surely that cannot be right Nobody wants unlimited irregular migration, but without Motion C1 or Motion J1 we are essentially saying in this Bill that Uighurs, Christians fleeing persecution and people from Ukraine or any of the hot spots of the world who come to this country are criminalised and are second-class refugees.",3
"If in the end they say yes, as I suspect they will, of course we will have reluctantly to give way, but do we really want to say that a Ukrainian being bombed and fleeing on 3 January or whenever the illegal Russian invasion started—it applies from 1 January—who arrives in this country without a visa, a passport and the proper papers is illegal and a second-class refugee?",3
The Government say the Bill conforms to the refugee convention.,3
"The UNHCR said: “The Nationality and Borders Bill follows almost to the letter the Government’s New Plan for Immigration Policy Statement, issued on 24 March 2021, in some cases adding further restrictions on the right to claim asylum and on the rights of refugees.",3
"UNHCR must therefore regretfully reiterate its considered view that the Bill is fundamentally at odds with the Government’s avowed commitment to upholding the United Kingdom’s international obligations under the Refugee Convention and with the country’s longstanding role as a global champion for the refugee cause.” That is why Motion B1 is so important, why the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, and other noble Lords have made the remarks they have, and why my noble friend Lady Chakrabarti has moved this Motion.",3
"Between us, my noble friend Lord Paddick and I have put our names to all of the amendments, save that of the noble Lord, Lord Alton—nothing was meant by that except that it slipped past us—and we support them all The noble and learned Baroness referred to the combination of seeing victims of trafficking through the lens of immigration, as if this is all a single issue, ignoring the trauma and exploitation they have suffered as victims.",3
"I add that, of course, not all victims are immigrants.",3
"The Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner has commented that the Bill creates “a distinction between victims who are deserving of support and those who are not”, like deserving and undeserving refugees I will go back to trauma, which was referred to by the noble and learned Baroness.",3
"On the one hand we have low-paid, migrant domestic workers with very little in the way of rights and at risk of exploitation because of their precarious visa status and at risk of destitution and deportation if they cease to work for their specific employer.",2
"On the other hand, we have this visa category designed for the super-rich.",3
"It is part of a global order where being rich entitles you to buy politicians, avoid taxes and be exempted from the normal visa rules that bind the rest of humanity.",4
The migrant domestic worker visa almost guarantees exploitation of the workers by the super-rich and the tier 1 investment visas almost guarantee exploitation by the super-rich.,2
"It should not have taken an illegal war for the Government to pay attention to these very obvious consequences There is an inevitable immorality to becoming super-rich, whether the wealth was acquired through underpaying workers, misappropriating assets during the dissolution of Soviet Russia or the theft of resources from developing countries.",3
It was obviously wrong to establish a golden visa system for the super-rich.,2
It corrupted the immigration system and gave special rights to the global elite.,2
"I also express my sympathy to the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, for her nightmares It has been suggested by noble Lords that being able to change employer is of little use to those already close to their visa expiry date.",3
"We understand, of course, that it takes time to find work, but we must remind noble Lords that it is not the purpose of the domestic worker visa to enable migrant domestic workers to establish themselves in the labour market.",3
I remind noble Lords that we did take into account the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner’s advice in 2016 that relaxing the visa tie and allowing ODWs to stay for another two years without reporting to the authorities could inadvertently create a market for traffickers I move now to the issue of visa validity for overseas domestic workers and the proposal to reinstate a system of annual renewals and a path to settlement.,3
"Although I fully support noble Lords’ dedication to protections for migrant domestic workers, we do not believe this proposal would achieve what it purports to.",3
"The overseas domestic worker visa caters specifically for groups of visitors who, by definition, stay for short periods.",3
"Approximately 20,000 visas are issued every year on that basis, and we know the overwhelming majority leave well within the validity of their visa.",3
"They too leave before their visa expires, suggesting that, for the majority of those who use it, the visa serves its purpose That aside, the Government are not blind to the vulnerability of overseas domestic workers, which is why dedicated arrangements have been designed and delivered with these individuals in mind.",3
"This includes a standalone immigration route for victims of slavery who first entered the UK as domestic workers, which enables them to spend a further two years in the UK in that capacity.",3
"Unlike other visa holders, domestic workers who enter the national referral mechanism before their visa expires also benefit from continuing permission to work throughout the duration of their time in the NRM system.",3
"This amendment gives no thought to how the route should be modernised, or how better advantage could be taken of the infrastructure being introduced via the future borders and immigration system to improve the way we communicate with customers I respectfully contest the assertion that the system worked well in the past.",3
We must not forget that abuse existed before the terms of the visa were changed in 2012.,3
It is important to look forward rather than backwards and to prioritise ending the importation of exploitative practices from overseas in the first place.,3
"In particular, the Government, as noble Lords are well aware, have brought forward a number of measures in the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill, including removing key barriers to using unexplained wealth orders and bringing in a new register requiring anonymous foreign owners of UK property to reveal their identities Given that the tier 1 investor route has now been closed, I question whether it is sensible to constrain the Government’s ability to make improved provision for investment-related migration, which would be aimed at delivering real economic benefits, pending publication of a review of the previous arrangements.",3
"My Lords, Amendment 71 in my name and those of the noble Baroness, Lady Suttie, and my noble friend Lord Coaker was tabled in Committee and is brought back on Report because of the serious implications of Clause 71 for the cross-border economy between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.",3
"This provides for a pre-entry clearance system that requires anyone who does not need a visa, entry clearance or other specified immigration status to obtain authorisation before travelling to the UK, including on journeys within the common travel area, which the UK and Ireland are part of.",4
"Indeed, the present clause has been expressly formulated to ensure that CTA journeys are captured Obviously, as I said earlier, this system does not apply to British or Irish citizens, and it appears that the UK Government intend the scheme to apply on the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, of which there are about 300 crossings on a very tortuous line, but this looks to be in breach of the rights provisions of Article 2 of the protocol.",3
"It also shows a total lack of understanding of this border, which has many crossings.",2
"Home Office Minister Kevin Foster confirmed that the ETA will involve payment of a fee and an online application However, I am more concerned about the economic, social and health consequences of Clause 71 for the people who live along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, particularly those who are not Irish or British citizens, of which there are many, and many of them contribute to the economy in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and have family who reside on the other side of the border Concerns have been raised about the impact of ETA on business, health, tourism, and recreational issues, as non-visa nationals in the Republic of Ireland would be required to obtain an ETA before a visit to Northern Ireland, a fact that has been recognised and raised by the Irish Government because it would have an impact on tourism to Northern Ireland.",3
"In the context of an invisible land border that British and Irish citizens can freely cross, it is eminently foreseeable that many other people who have hitherto been able to similarly cross the border without any prior permission will largely be unaware of this ETA requirement The written response from the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, to our committee some weeks ago, and the response from the noble Lord, Lord Sharpe, in Committee to me do not adequately address the situation.",3
They do not provide for the exemption to the ETA requirement for non-Irish British citizens who enter Ireland legally or are legally resident in Ireland and who do not currently require permission to enter the UK for short-term cross-border travel from Ireland to Northern Ireland.,3
"While the letter states that the Government will not criminalise those who are simply living their everyday lives, the scheme as has been outlined would do exactly that for large numbers of people who currently cross the border without restrictions to access essential services, support supply chains, for education or visiting family It is worth pointing out that the UK’s ETA proposals would also undermine several core areas of north/south co-operation as set out in strand 2 of the Good Friday agreement.",3
"As I said before, most tourists enter the island via Ireland’s ports and airports, and 70% of the £1 billion tourism spending in Northern Ireland comes from foreign visitors The ETA scheme would also undermine established cross-border healthcare service provision and the recently signed UK-Ireland CTA healthcare memorandum of understanding, which establishes entitlement on the basis of residency.",3
"Healthcare in border regions is highly integrated—I think of Newry and County Louth, Craigavon and Monaghan, Fermanagh and Cavan, Altnagelvin and Letterkenny in County Donegal—with the closest service often across the border, including jointly funded cancer and cardiac services based in Northern Ireland and vice versa In this context, I ask the Minister: what discussions have taken place with the Irish Government?",3
"Have there been discussions with civic society—with the businesses that will be impacted, which gain from the employment of many of these people on a cross-border basis?",3
Will there be any exemptions or special arrangements for people crossing the land border frequently from the Republic of Ireland?,4
"I will start by addressing Amendment 77, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, regarding settlement fees for non-UK members of our Armed Forces The Government highly value the service of all members of the Armed Forces, including Commonwealth nationals and Gurkhas from Nepal, who have a long and distinguished history of service to the UK here and overseas.",3
"That is why there are special immigration rules in place for our Armed Forces personnel that put them in a favourable position compared to other migrants, as I detailed last month during Committee.",3
"Furthermore, reducing the fees for dependants of both non-UK and British Armed Forces personnel would be similarly discriminatory and unfair to those in other professions, many of whom face similar concerns and are contributing to the UK in other ways There is additional support for families in planning for the cost of visa fees.",3
"The issue raised by this amendment has largely been addressed by the recently announced government policy, which is due to be implemented in the near future I turn next to Amendment 78, tabled by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, regarding citizenship and settlement rights for British-Hong Kong veterans.",3
The noble Lord said that Covid had sent immigration into a tailspin.,3
"Certainly it has distorted the immigration figures and, although refugee numbers were high in 2021, as the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Rolfe, said, that is because they were much lower in the previous two years because of Covid The International Passenger Survey is not the vehicle by which accurate immigration figures should be counted, as the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, said.",3
"The IPS conducts between 700,000 and 800,000 interviews in a normal year, of which over 250,000 are used to produce estimates of overseas travel and tourism, so I do not even think that it is intended to be an accurate measure of people coming here to live, as such.",3
"This is hardly a basis for accurate migration figures Can the Minister please tell the House how the Home Office keeps track of those entering and leaving the UK, particularly those entering visa-free from the EU/EEA and the 10 other countries whose nationals can now use the e-passport gates?",3
"Can the Minister also explain why citizens of the United States, say, can enter visa-free and use the e-passport gates but UK citizens cannot do the same when entering the United States?",4
"I thought that we were taking back control of our borders Amendment 81, as drafted, would include those crossing the channel by ferry and by Eurostar legitimately, which is not quite what the noble Baroness was seeking to achieve.",3
I note that their interest lies in ensuring that the Secretary of State publishes regular data on a range of areas on immigration.,3
"I acknowledge the importance which my noble friend Lady Neville-Rolfe attaches to statistics, and I acknowledge the important work which the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, has carried out over many years, which serves to inform debates not only in the public sphere but in this place I assure the House that the Home Office provides a wide range of immigration data on a regular basis and has done for many years.",3
"This includes information on many parts of the immigration system, including the asylum and resettlement systems, returns and detention, and other areas such as visas and citizenship.",3
"All this demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that the public have the information they need to understand migration trends, and that the approach to small boat arrivals is in line with these other statistics on the immigration system The Home Office reviews the statistics that it publishes as a department, in line with the Code of Practice for Statistics.",3
"While the Home Office publishes statistics in relation to the operation of the immigration system, the ONS is responsible for the national migration and population estimates.",3
It did not tell us what we needed to know about migrant patterns or give us enough detail to get a robust understanding of migration.,3
The Office for National Statistics is instead working on producing statistics that will tell us more about migrant patterns.,3
"We need to ensure, as I think the House agrees, that we have a clear understanding of such issues and their implications for the data before we publish anything or we risk doing precisely what the noble Baroness, Lady Fox of Buckley, said we risked: misleading the public and undermining faith in statistics, rather than enhancing the public’s understanding of such important matters In relation to Amendment 81, the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, from the Opposition Front Bench and others have pressed us on the alteration or the presentation of small boat statistics.",3
"Following advice from the independent UK Statistics Authority on making sure statistics on small boat crossings are published in an orderly way, the Home Office published a new statistics report on irregular migration to the United Kingdom.",3
"The report, which includes statistics on those arriving across the channel in small boats, was published for the first time on 24 February, covering data up to December 2021.",3
"We will update on a quarterly basis The decision to publish small boats figures in a quarterly report ensures regular statistics are released in an orderly, transparent way that is accessible to everyone, meeting the principles set out in the code of practice for statistics.",3
"The approach has been particularly important in allowing us to present small boats data in the wider context of longer-term trends, other methods of irregular entry and the immigration system more widely, and hence to provide statistics on a more sound basis.",3
"Where it is clearly in the public interest to have more frequent releases of information, we will consider this, as we have done with the EU settlement scheme, on which we publish statistics monthly In the case of small boats, publishing frequent updates will not provide sufficient time to collate the data collected in the field by operational staff and integrate that with the information from the asylum applications.",3
"My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lady McIntosh for tabling Amendments 83 and 84, concerning the fees that may be charged in relation to registration of British citizenship.",3
"I say at the outset that the Government recognise that the acquisition of British citizenship is a significant life event and offers particular value to those able to obtain it, particularly children.",3
"All noble Lords agree with this point and have observed it Apart from allowing a child to apply for a British citizen passport, British citizenship gives them the opportunity to participate more fully in the life of their local community as they grow up.",4
"Since the establishment of the current nationality regime in the British Nationality Act 1981, registration of British citizenship for those who either have an entitlement under the provisions of that Act or who are applying on a discretionary basis under Section 3(1) has been contingent on payment of a fee.",3
"Current fee-setting for British citizenship is underpinned by the powers set out under Section 68(9) of the Immigration Act 2014 which, as the Supreme Court has affirmed in its recent judgment, were explicitly authorised by Parliament and empowered the Secretary of State to set fees at a level that reflected the costs of exercising the function, the benefits that accrue to an applicant as a result of acquiring that British citizenship, and the wider costs of the borders and migration system.",3
"Parliament also explicitly authorised the maximum amount that may be charged in relation to an application for British citizenship registration at £1,500, through the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order 2016, which sets the framework for the current fees set out in secondary legislation The wider application of these principles and the powers to set immigration and nationality fees have underpinned the Government’s policy over the last decade of moving the borders and migration system to an increasingly self-funded basis, reducing the reliance on the UK taxpayer.",3
"Accordingly, fees across several routes, including nationality, have increased to support those broader funding objectives However, it is important to be clear on the role that these fees play in supporting the essential work of the border and migration system and particularly in funding the critical activity that supports and safeguards the interests of the people in the UK.",3
"These activities, which include ensuring that the UK’s borders are secure from threats and illegal activity, the effective operation of resettlement schemes to support those who are in greatest need and the management of a visa system that attracts the best and brightest to contribute to the UK’s prosperity, are essential to the delivery of the department’s wider mission and objectives Any reduction in income from fees must therefore be considered in terms of its impact on these activities, with the likely result being that activity in those areas will be reduced or income must be recovered through other means.",3
"Fees charged are kept under review, as they are in other countries, and, as I have stated, there are ongoing considerations regarding fees charged for citizenship registration specifically, the outcome of which we will share in due course Additionally, I emphasise that elements of the amendment, such as the requirement to except fees for children in local authority care, although of course well intentioned, would more appropriately be set out in fees regulations and should not be introduced in primary legislation.",3
"In addition, it is not appropriate for a duty to have regard to the need to promote British citizenship in primary legislation that is setting fees.",3
"My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Lister of Burtersett, for bringing this regret Motion and for so comprehensively setting out the grounds for it Time after time in this House and in Grand Committee, other noble Lords and I have questioned the policy that border and immigration systems have to be self-funding.",3
To say that only those who apply for a passport or visa or for UK nationality use or benefit from border and immigration services is clearly false.,3
"Everyone in the UK benefits from border control and control over who receives temporary or permanent leave to remain in the UK, and from the granting of UK citizenship.",4
"For example, in terms of counterterrorism, it has been shown that those people who acquire British citizenship are far more likely to show loyalty to the country than those who do not The premise is also false in that citizens from EU, EEA and 10 other countries benefit from visa-free entry to the UK and use Border Force services to enter the UK—none of whom at this time pays a penny towards the cost of border control or immigration services.",3
"Not only are those who apply for a UK passport, a visa to enter the UK or UK citizenship subsidising border and immigration services that benefit all UK citizens; they are also subsidising hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors who enter the UK every year without the need for a visa When asked why the Home Office is unique in being required to make border and immigration services self-funding, the only answer is, “Because this is government policy.” Can the Minister tell the House why it is government policy, and why, for example, the NHS is not required to be self-funding?",3
"The safety and security of the people is supposed to be the Government’s primary responsibility, yet a major part of ensuring that—ensuring that foreign criminals and others not conducive to the public good do not enter the UK, for example—has to be self-funding.",3
"Why On the other aspect of the regret Motion, whether it is in the best interests of children to charge them for securing their right to UK citizenship, let alone £596 over the cost of processing an application, the answer is clearly no.",3
Is this young person likely to know about and understand the consequences of not claiming the UK nationality he is entitled to before he is deported by the Home Office as a foreign national criminal?,3
"For perhaps the only time in the next couple of months, I sat on the Conservative side of the House to watch Zelensky give his powerful speech, as we showed unity, with party differences put aside for that day The ongoing war has forced more than 2.5 million people, mainly women and children, to flee their country and face the prospect of many months of uncertainty in refugee camps across Europe.",3
"Indeed, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has called it the “fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II”, with many predicting that numbers could exceed 4 million people in the months ahead While many of our European partners have scrapped their bureaucratic red tape to enable hundreds of thousands of people who are cold, hungry, grieving and desperately in need of support to seek sanctuary in their country, our Government have offered little more than hollow promises until this day.",3
The visa processing centre that the Home Office set up in Calais was little more than a single desk that failed to offer desperate Ukrainians either appointments or walk-in access.,3
"Inexplicably, it was not even made public as tens of thousands of Ukrainians streamed across France in search of safe passage The reality is that this is the culmination of more than a decade of this Government’s hostile environment policy that, as everyone knows, is nothing more than a dog-whistle, anti-immigrant, racist agenda that prevents some of the most vulnerable people on Earth from seeking sanctuary on our shores, and has perhaps been too successful by far.",3
I believe that the Home Secretary should hang her head in shame and explain why we are the only country in Europe that has failed to offer an accessible route to reunite refugees with their families.,3
"By comparison, our partners across Europe have thrown open their borders, slashed red tape and taken countless vulnerable families In their hour of need, we can and must do better for millions of Ukrainians.",3
"The best our Government appear to be able to offer is a do-it-yourself asylum scheme, where UK householders are asked to name refugees they wish to sponsor, which would suggest we are asking Ukrainian refugees to essentially crowd source their own asylum applications That is why we in the Labour party are calling for emergency protection visas for those fleeing Ukraine who wish to reach the UK.",3
"This would lift normal visa requirements other than biometrics and security checks, which can be swiftly done en route.",3
"In my Ilford South office, we still have more than 220 active cases of Afghan refugees, some of which are still receiving boiler-plate responses from the Home Office and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.",3
"The promises we made at the time to take only 20,000 people over the next four years were deplorable, but showed the true face of our immigration and refugee policy On the issue of sanctions against Russia, it is clear we must go far further to cut out the rot of dirty Russian money in our political system.",3
We have heard a great deal of criticism of the Government’s response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis.,3
It is a DIY refugee scheme.,3
I remind Ministers that we are a signatory to international treaties governing the treatment of refugees.,3
"The legal position is that refugees have the right to seek asylum and that states are obligated to grant it, where appropriate.",3
"I know the visa scheme has since been extended, but it is a visa scheme, which is not how the asylum system has worked I am sorry to say these failings have become customary under this Government and their predecessors.",3
"There have been attempts to push back refugees in the channel, refugees have been kept in buildings that are not fit for habitation and some have contracted serious disease in unsanitary conditions.",3
"We have seen others, including British citizens, wrongly deported from this country It should never be forgotten that this Government and their predecessors are indelibly stained by the continuing Windrush scandal.",3
"The Government’s responses to date are woefully lacking Even in the light of all that, the Government persist with their anti-refugee Nationality and Borders Bill.",3
"We have to conclude that, like Pavlov’s dog, Ministers’ reflexes take over when they hear the words “migrants” and “refugees,” and their reflexes are distasteful and objectionable.",3
"Whenever I speak about this Government’s treatment of refugees, I am reminded that he said: “The way a Government treats refugees is very instructive because it shows you how they would treat the rest of us if they thought they could get away with it.” My advice to this Government would be to be more like the British people in their treatment of refugees, before the British people see them for who they really are.",3
"The Home Office has had access to passport data, including the number of passports set to expire, all the way through the pandemic and was therefore fully aware, or at least ought to have been, of the spike in applications that was likely to come as soon as restrictions on travel were lifted.",3
"I was made aware, in preparing for this debate, of a case where grandparents had bought a holiday for their grandson as a gift for his 18th birthday, not realising he did not have a passport.",3
"Their inability to get passports for their children is not only risking their ability to travel in accordance with their plans, but preventing them from enrolling their children in school.",2
"For many, having that travel document as a simple form of ID is vital for business, family or practical reasons, or simply for accessing crucial public services For many, the failure of the system to process applications timeously and to issue passports will mean yet more forced separations from family and loved ones, after two years of the pandemic and the restrictions we have all been living under.",3
"The Government also need to look at the issues around lost or stolen passport cases, which currently seem to sit outside all escalation processes.",3
"In many cases, people will need passports faster than any travel date, simply to get visas from other jurisdictions in order to travel It is not as if the Government were not forewarned.",3
"As early as July 2020, as the first lockdown eased, the issue of passport backlogs was raised with HM Passport Office.",3
"Back then the official response was that staff were “working hard to ensure that anyone with pre-planned travel does not miss out if their passport application has been submitted correctly and in good time” However, there have been many, many issues that a simple, bland public relations assurance cannot paper over.",3
"When we look at the issues in HM Passport Office at the minute, a lot of it is the privatised areas.” The Government have serious questions to answer about their choice of private providers, particularly their choice of courier, given customers’ experience of the service when their passports are finally issued.",3
It is easy to laugh at the Government’s puerile obsession with the symbolism of being able to issue blue Brexit passports.,3
"Quite frankly, I would not care if my passport was bright yellow with pink polka-dots if it arrived on time to allow me to get on with what I was doing The Home Office clearly does not have its troubles to seek.",3
"We have seen it in the tragedy of Windrush, the botched handling of the Afghan and Ukrainian refugee crises, the plans to intercept boats in the channel on jet skis, the callousness of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 and the looming omnishambles of the Rwanda deportations.",3
"The reason we tabled the motion is the suffering of the hundreds and thousands of our constituents who cannot get a passport As we have heard, the current situation in the Passport Office is causing serious problems for millions of people who are seeking to apply for or renew their passport.",3
"While millions of people wait eagerly for their passports to be renewed, she is spending her energy devising ever more absurd and inhumane methods of making the UK an unwelcoming place for those fleeing persecution around the world.",3
"If the Home Secretary spent less time trying to deport people to Rwanda and more time managing her office, we might see progress—but for the sake of my health, I will not hold my breath.",3
"We see delays in visa applications, delays in the Homes for Ukraine scheme and delays for asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their case, with many waiting for more than a decade.",3
"To put it bluntly, the Home Office under its current leadership is not fit for purpose, and people will remember this when the general election rolls around Under this Government—12 years of Tory Government —passport waiting times are up; NHS waiting times, up; ambulance waiting times, up; GP waiting times, up; police response times, up; immigration biometrics waiting times, up; dentist waiting times, up; driving licence waiting times, up; cost of living, up.",3
"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker This passport chaos is, to borrow the phrase used recently by one Minister, “absolutely godawful”.",3
"Member for Torbay (Kevin Foster), said gives any comfort to the people who are queuing in a panic outside the Passport Office in my constituency, or waiting by their letterbox day after day for passports that have yet to arrive.",3
"One constituent, Scott, experienced significant delays: he made his application on 25 January and his passport was finally delivered on 9 April—to the wrong address.",3
"It is a serious data breach if passports are indeed being delivered to the wrong person, as other Members have highlighted These delays and lack of response are not uncommon.",3
"As I mentioned in an intervention, my constituent, Henry, has some issues with TNT, which failed to deliver his passport on three occasions; it got sent back to Peterborough.",3
"As of Sunday, he was still waiting for his passport.",3
It is hugely frustrating to know that he could have had his passport had TNT not messed up the delivery My constituent Jennifer contacted me on 28 May and said: “I am writing to you as I have a real dilemma trying to get my daughter her first adult passport.,3
"This is devastating for her.” I contacted Jennifer today and she emailed me to say that the passport application has been approved, but that there is still no sign of the actual passport.",3
He will lose thousands of pounds if the passport for his child does not arrive within the next week or so.,3
"I urge the Minister to consider the fact that Scottish schools break up for the summer holidays next week, so there is a real and pressing case to prioritise passport applications for people in Scotland and in other parts of the UK who may go off on holiday a little earlier.",3
"Her son’s first passport arrived on 10 June, but she had applied for passports for her whole family on 1 March.",3
"The other members of the family got their passports, but there was nothing for her son.",3
"That is just not practical—I am sure that Ministers would not want them to so in any event It is incredibly distressing for families to go through this stress, not knowing whether a passport will arrive, not knowing whether they should cancel their holiday on the off chance that it does not arrive or whether they should wait in the hope that it arrives just in time.",3
"My constituent, despite many attempts to get in touch to resolve this issue, has only just got an appointment with the Home Office to get their passport application under way.",3
They do not yet know whether they will get their passport in time to travel.,3
"It is a relatively simple visa case, but my constituent may not be able to be present for the birth of their first child.",4
"If the Home Office does not get its finger out, the mother will give birth on her own without the support of her husband There is a lot of talk from the Government about the cost of the immigration system and the cost of keeping people in inexpensive hotels and temporary accommodation.",3
It is a yet more expensive plan—a white elephant—of sending people to Rwanda through state-sponsored deportations and state-sponsored trafficking This is nothing that my constituents in Scotland have voted for.,3
"When we have a passport system of our own—I hope that that day will come very soon—we will look at Westminster and say, “Good grief, we cannot do any worse than this mob.”",3
"I am conscious of the legal difficulties, and I am also conscious that Ministers are working on it, but I would like to see some progress On sanctions avoidance, when the SNP supported the statutory instruments bringing forward the sanctions, I raised concerns, particularly about the overseas territories.",3
There was an assurance that the overseas territories would sign up to these sanctions and that loopholes would not be allowed to be created.,3
How is the evolving nature of that threat being taken forward The biggest area of disagreement between the SNP and the Government is on refugees.,3
"I have long said that the UK should have done the same as the EU did: to waive visas, not to wave flags.",3
"I regret the decisions that the UK Government have made on that On the Homes for Ukraine scheme, the British Association of Social Workers has drawn concerns to all our attention in its useful brief, which highlights in particular the risks in the safeguarding of refugees and the proper checks that must be run on potential host families.",3
"We think that they will be strong additions to defensive capabilities and we would like to see them integrated as soon as possible now that the Finns and the Swedes have made their democratic intentions clear On UK-EU relations, the EU’s defence and foreign affairs capability has evolved at lightspeed in the last few months with the peace instrument, the strategic compass and the permanent structured co-operation growing arms and legs.",3
"I draw attention to the sobering briefing given to us by the Red Cross, which says: “The UN projects that a further 8-20 million people will now be left hungry from the knock-on effects of soaring prices and broken supply chains for grains, cooking oil, fertiliser and fuel.” The UK Government, working with local and international partners, must look beyond the borders of Europe and act urgently to prevent a food crisis.",3
I echo the comments of the Chair of the Defence Committee on the integrated review.,3
"As Putin’s military aggression continues against the people of Ukraine, with reports involving civilians of murders, enforced disappearances, deportations, imprisonment, torture, rape and the desecration of corpses, there is a strong case for saying that Putin’s actions have gone well beyond war crimes and that we must explore recent reports of what could amount to a genocide of the Ukrainian people.",3
The amazing volunteers from Keighley have driven it all to the Polish border with Ukraine.,3
This fantastic group is working incredibly hard at a local level to ensure that the right support is provided to the refugees who make it to Ilkley and the wider area of my constituency.,3
"In a short amount of time, the volunteers have created a great network of communications channels in my constituency to ensure that refugees have the right support to get into education settings and that healthcare settings are as supportive as possible The Home Office is getting through a huge amount of visa applications, but personally I still have 11 outstanding cases that I raise with the Home Office repetitively, on a daily basis—I was at the hub in Portcullis House again only yesterday.",3
"You are right, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the House is considering narrower and narrower aspects of the Bill, but despite the fact that this is the fifth time it has come to the House, still no Minister has been able to explain how the United Kingdom, which is surrounded by water, can ever be the first safe country of arrival for an undocumented asylum seeker The proposals in the Bill, and the Government’s determination to overturn repeated amendments of the House of Lords on this aspect, are literally inhumane.",3
The Minister stands at the Dispatch Box and says that we fully comply with the refugee convention and therefore an amendment to put the refugee convention into the Bill is unnecessary.,3
"Instead the Government want to make criminals out of Eritrean human rights defenders fleeing for their lives, LGBT+ women and men from Rwanda seeking a more tolerant society in which to live, and Ukrainians who, for whatever reason, cannot get through the interminable Home Office visa processing system to reunite here with friends and families When the Minister winds up, can he explain whether the effect of the Bill and the agreement is that if a young Ukrainian man arrives at the UK border without documentation, he will be criminalised—or will he be sent to build a new life in Rwanda?",3
"Indeed, when an asylum seeker from Rwanda arrives here on a small boat, will they be sent back to Rwanda to seek asylum and rebuild their life?",3
"In what world could that possibly match with the provisions and duties that this country has under the terms of the refugee convention as outlined in Lords amendment 5 It is not just the Archbishop of Canterbury who is speaking out on this—and incidentally he has every right to do so, because he is a member of the legislature as a Member of the House of the Lords—because religious leaders across the country have written to us.",3
"In amendment 7, the Lords calls once again for asylum seekers to be granted the right to work—not granted the right to work but for their right to work to be recognised, because the right to work is a fundamental human right that cannot be taken away.",3
"Denying that opportunity to asylum seekers, along with the denial of access to public funds in some cases, is not only degrading to them but actively harmful to our own economy and to wider society This Bill has been of huge concern to constituents in Glasgow North who have followed it right the way through every single level of amendments that we have had from the House of Lords.",3
"The Scottish Parliament is ready and willing to accept responsibility for immigration law, and the people of Scotland are ready to accept it and all the other powers that go along with being an independent country.",3
"However, such circumstances are comparatively rare and the numbers involved would not be a serious problem, I would have thought, for our social services or immigration system.",3
"After all, in those circumstance, very few children would be able to obtain the finances to pay people smugglers to bring them illegally to this country Can the Minister tell us more about the reasons unaccompanied children give for arriving here without parent, relative or guardian?",3
"Parents may not be able to obtain the money to pay for more than one passage, so they send a teenager in the hope that he or she will at least have a better life than they have back in their homeland However, there are probably innumerable families in poor and troubled countries who would willingly send a child here if they could; they are essentially economic migrants, not political refugees.",4
"But we are talking, of course, of people coming here illegally from Europe.",2
"My Lords, first, if Ukrainians who are already here are students or have a work visa, their visas will expire at some point.",4
"One does not want them to fall into illegality and they could be subject to exploitation, as the noble Lord just said.",3
"However, they could also be helpful with the integration of the people coming here.",3
"Secondly—I realise that neither point may have crossed the Minister’s desk or his mind yet, although clearly he is bringing a lot of imagination to this—I have a question on Syrians who have been recognised as refugees in Ukraine.",3
I have heard—this may or may not be right—that they are being told that they need to make an asylum claim from the very start.,3
The anti-immigration rhetoric that he was using is in stark contrast to the reality of the situation.,3
I do not believe that any human being is illegal.,3
"When we use words like “illegal” about fellow human beings, we are on very dangerous ground indeed In stark contrast, though, I have been in tears of joy over the past few days, but I can assure Members that it is not over the Queen’s Speech.",3
"They have elected the great Roza Salih, who becomes the first refugee elected as a councillor in Scotland.",3
"Is that not something, when we hear the rhetoric from some on the Government Benches about “immigrants”?",3
"They use this anti-immigrant language, when we have a brilliant young woman who is now engaging in public service.",3
That is why I want asylum seekers to be given the right to work The Blair Government made a mistake when they stopped asylum seekers having the right to work.,3
It is absolutely scandalous that we allow asylum seekers to live on the equivalent of what I was earning as a youth trainee with Strathclyde Regional Council 30 years ago.,3
"After a period of time—say, six months—asylum seekers should have the right to work and make their contribution to this economy.",3
"The amendments are the work of the Law Society of Scotland, and in particular I pay tribute to its immigration and asylum sub-committee, which has considered this part of the Bill in some detail The Law Society of Scotland states that it agrees with Clause 1, subject to the registration process being free.",3
"This group mostly comprises children and those with subsidiary categories of British nationality, such as British Overseas Territories Citizens and British National (Overseas) passport holders from Hong Kong who now have a route to citizenship through the bespoke British National (Overseas) visa Nationality law should be amended to allow children born in the UK to be British citizens automatically, restoring a policy that applied before 1983 Vulnerable groups of people should be encouraged to take legal advice, which should be affordable and widely available in all parts of the UK.” The Law Society looked particularly at the case of PRCBC and O v Secretary of State for the Home Department—reported in “[2021] EWCA Civ 193”—where the Court of Appeal held that the fee of £1,012 for certain applications by children to register was unlawfully high.",3
"Yet while the Government invariably use the language of protecting women, their programme of austerity, real-terms cuts to benefits and pensions, and assaults on civil liberties explicitly target those of us most at risk—migrants, as well as black, Asian and minority ethnic women, and Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities The cruel “no recourse to public funds” condition prevents women from accessing help when most at need, and the hostile and racist immigration system tightens around women facing deportation, imprisons women in unacceptable conditions and even sees women drown at sea when they try to seek safety.",3
"I plead with the Government today: please scrap the inhumane Nationality and Borders Bill, which risks criminalising refugees, including Ukrainian refugees, who arrive in the UK through an irregular route.",3
"Instead, the Government should ensure that there are always safe routes for those seeking sanctuary and asylum Too often, under this Government the very institutions that are meant to protect us are in fact failing us, over and over again.",2
"Meanwhile, our fellow citizens face huge challenges: climate change-induced heatwave, looming strikes, inflation, cost of living crisis, energy crisis, record NHS backlog, passports backlog, Home Office backlog, courts backlog—backlog Britain If we are trying to define exactly what Johnsonism is, we would have in there the idea that the rules do not apply to those at the top, self-advancement, Government by slogan and, as Dominic Cummings put it, a “shopping trolley” modus operandi.",3
"Remember the pro-EU and anti-EU columns, or the one-time fan of an amnesty for illegal immigrants who now wants to ship off asylum seekers to Rwanda?",3
"From the Windrush scandal to the small boats crisis, and from the Nationality and Borders Bill to the response to Putin’s barbaric assault on Ukraine, we are witnessing a Government Department whose approach is defined by a toxic combination of incompetence and indifference We have had to endure the embarrassing spectacle of the Home Secretary contradicting her own Department’s announcement on the number of visas granted, and then compounding the confusion by claiming that an application centre for Ukrainians had been opened in Calais when that was patently not the case.",3
"While I commend the Immigration Minister for deleting the tweet in which he suggested that Ukrainians fleeing the horrors of war should apply for fruit picker visas, I nevertheless repeat my request that he apologise for that tweet, as it is clear that such an apology would go a long way to reassuring the public that the Government have grasped the horrific reality of the situation A Government who fail to plan are a Government who plan to fail.",3
"From the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko to the invasion of Georgia, and from butchery in Syria to the illegal annexation of Crimea and the state-sponsored hit on the Skripals, Mr Putin’s track record of murder and mayhem since he came to power is not exactly a state secret Putin has been massing his troops on the Ukrainian border since October last year.",3
"We protested again, and the Government finally relented, so thankfully all extended family members are now included in the scope of the family reunion route Then the Home Secretary was insisting on Ukrainians with passports and family in the UK having to wait for days in visa application centres rather than applying online and doing the biometric checks here in the UK.",3
"They disagree with the Government on the level of support and the way refugees are handled, but they have done it constructively, and I could fully support most of the motion they have tabled.",3
"Our military support to Ukraine has been huge, and our humanitarian support to the countries bordering Ukraine is probably the most in Europe.",3
"I think that is important testimony to how well this Government have done I think there is a very important point about looking after refugees, mainly women and children, who are fleeing Ukraine and getting out of Ukraine to the bordering countries, and who will want to be looked after there until the Russians can be defeated in Ukraine and they can then go back to their loved ones in Ukraine.",3
"I think we should do everything we can to help those countries, and I congratulate all the countries bordering Ukraine on the support they have given people who have either come from a warzone, with all the trauma they are facing there, or are fleeing in advance of the war coming towards them.",4
"I think we should give great credit to our European neighbours for that, and the fact that we are giving massive humanitarian aid is very important I want to deal in particular with the issue of human trafficking.",3
"I chaired the all-party group on human trafficking for a number of years, and these evil gangs—“evil gangs” does not do justice to how awful these people are—have moved into the areas to which refugees are coming in those countries.",3
"What human traffickers, and by the way these are not the same as smugglers, do is take young women and children and offer them, they say, a safe route to this country or that country, perhaps even to the United Kingdom, but what they actually do is put them into modern-day slavery, prostitution or forced labour.",3
"Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May), brought up in the debate yesterday My particular concern is about Moldova, which is a small country bordering Ukraine, but not in the EU.",3
"That very small country has taken in 100,000 refugees, but Moldova was already known for human trafficking.",3
"There was always a problem with human trafficking gangs there, and they are now operating to a greater degree.",2
"We have led the fight against human trafficking in Europe, and we need to have people on the ground at the border to stop the trafficking gangs getting hold of these people and forcing them into a most evil situation.",2
We all want to do everything possible to assist the efforts to find safe places for the millions of refugees who are now fleeing Russian aggression.,3
"The Minister— I think I heard him correctly, but he can correct me if I have got it wrong—said that there are currently 5,500 refugees in the UK.",3
"I think that was the figure he gave, but the number of refugees is about to reach the 3 million mark, so 5,500 seems to me—I do not know about you, Madam Deputy Speaker—a very small figure to be proud of, particularly when 1.8 million have gone to Poland, 263,000 to Hungary, 230,000 to Slovakia, 453,000 to Romania, and 337,000 to Moldova, doubling its population.",3
"Fair enough, those nations border Ukraine, but Germany has taken in 147,000 and Ireland, which has a tenth of the population of the UK, has taken in some 6,646.",3
I know their profound ideological beliefs when it comes to issues around immigration and people coming to the UK.,3
"I almost feel sorry for them, because they are obviously seeing all the images that we are seeing and I believe that they really want to do something for the refugees they observe in such difficulty.",3
"I know they want to offer refuge to people in crisis, but that is weighed down by practically everything that informs them about immigration, refugees and anybody seeking to come to our shores.",3
"For years, they have fomented a deep, deep antipathy to everything to do with immigration and entry to the UK.",2
"That is the bad side, but then there is talk of 100,000 or 200,000 refugee places being available.",3
"Then there are U-turns and offers of accommodation schemes, but they are always counterbalanced by failing to meet Europe in offering visa-free access.",3
"Let us remember that this is a Government whose major political programme of the past few years has been delivering a Brexit that had immigration, taking control and stopping people coming to the UK as its cold, beating heart.",3
This is a Government who designed the hostile environment with the most careful attention to detail—a Government who sent hate vans to the streets of London that showed handcuffs and told illegal immigrants: “Go home or face arrest”.,3
"With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the Government’s world-leading migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda The British people have repeatedly voted for controlled immigration and the right to secure borders.",4
"Last night we aimed to relocate the first people from our country who arrived here through dangerous and illegal means, including by small boat.",3
"But our capacity to help those in need is severely compromised by those who come here illegally and, as we have discussed in this House many, many times, seek to jump the queue because they can afford to pay the people smugglers.",3
"It is illegal, and it is not necessary, because they are coming from other safe countries.",2
"It makes us less safe as nation, because those who come here illegally do not have the regularised checks or even the regularised status and because evil people-smuggling gangs use the proceeds of their ill-gotten gains to fund other appalling crimes that undermine the security of our country.",2
It is also lethally dangerous for those who are smuggled.,2
"People have drowned at sea, suffocated in lorries and perished crossing territories The humane, decent and moral response to all this is simply not to stand by and let people drown or be sold into slavery or smuggled, but to stop it.",3
"The global asylum system is broken and between 80 million and 100 million people are now displaced, and others are on the move seeking better economic opportunities.",2
"An international problem requires international solutions The UK and Rwanda have shown the way forward by working together, and this partnership sends a clear message that illegal entry will not be tolerated, while offering a practical, humane way forward for those who arrive to the UK via illegal routes.",3
"It is another example of how all too often, critics not only do not know what they are speaking about, but seek to vilify another country that has a good track record when it comes to refugees and stepping up to international responsibilities Rwanda is a safe and secure country with an outstanding track record of supporting refugees and asylum seekers.",3
We will not accept that we have no right to control our borders.,2
"We will do everything necessary to keep this country safe, and we will continue our long and proud tradition of helping those in genuine need Many of us have met refugees, both abroad and on British soil, and listened to the stories that are frankly chilling and heartbreaking.",3
"Having overseen efforts to bring to the UK thousands of people in absolute need, including from Hong Kong, Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine, I am the first to say that controlled immigration, including by refugees, is good and outstanding for our country, but we simply have to focus on supporting those who need it most, and not those who have picked the UK as a destination over a safe country such as France.",3
"It is no use pretending that those people are fleeing persecution when they are travelling from a safe country Our capacity to help is not infinite, and public support for the asylum system will be fatally undermined if we do not act.",2
The critics of the migration and economic development partnership have no alternative proposal to deal with uncontrolled immigration.,3
"That is irresponsible and utterly indifferent to those who we seek to help and support I have always said that I will look at all proposals to reduce illegal migration and illegal entry to our country, even those that Opposition Members might put forward, although we are still waiting for them.",3
They still stand for open borders—pure and simple.,3
"She knew that among the people she was planning to send to Rwanda on that plane were torture and trafficking victims, that she did not have a proper screening process in place and that some of them might be children.",3
"Can she confirm that the Home Office itself withdrew a whole series of those cases on Friday and yesterday because it knew that there was a problem with them, and that even without the European Court of Human Rights judgment, she was planning to send a plane with just seven people on board, because she had had to withdraw most of the cases at the last minute The Home Secretary knows that there is a lack of proper asylum capacity in Rwanda to make fair decisions and that as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says, Rwanda normally deals with only a few hundred cases a year and has only one eligibility officer who prepares the cases.",3
"Will she tell us now how much she promised Rwanda for each of the people she was planning to send yesterday, and how many Rwandan refugees she promised to take in return The Home Secretary knows that serious concerns have been raised about Rwandan restrictions on political freedom, the treatment of LGBT people, the fact that 12 refugees were shot by the authorities in 2018 for protesting against food cuts, and the fact that Afghan and Syrian asylum seekers have been returned by Rwanda.",3
"Can she confirm whether she has asked the NCA to draw up plans for staff cuts If the Home Secretary was serious, she would be taking seriously the fact that the Israel-Rwanda deal ended up increasing criminal people trafficking and smuggling and that her plan risks making things worse.",3
"If she was serious, she would be working night and day to get a better joint plan with France to crack down on the gangs and to stop the boats being put into the water in the first place, but she is not, because her relationship with French Ministers has totally broken down If the Home Secretary was serious about tackling illegal economic migration or cutting the bills from people in hotels, she would speed up Home Office decision making so that refugees can get support and those who are not can be returned home.",3
"We have a long tradition of hard work and stepping up to tackle problems—not offloading them—to tackle the criminal gangs who put lives at risk, and to do right by refugees.",3
"My party continues to deplore this unworkable, illegal and immoral policy.",3
"It does nothing to stop smugglers and it inflicts serious harm on victims, despite the Home Secretary’s cloud cuckoo land description of it.",3
"Will the Home Secretary tell her colleagues to heed the call from the Law Society and the Bar Council, and stop attacks on legal professionals who are simply doing their job It is not the lawyers who caused this flight to be cancelled nor any court; this flight was stopped because of the stench of yet more Government illegality.",3
"The UNHCR, the guardian of the refugee convention, is clear that this is in breach of it.",3
"She should start answering the basic questions that we did not get answers to on Monday, such as about oversight, age assessments, and screening for torture survivors and trafficking victims.",3
"There is a difference between trafficking and smuggling, and he is aware of some of the issues that have been materially rising over a number of years, and that thwart the removal and deportations not just of people who come to our country illegally, but also of foreign national offenders.",3
"I beg to move, That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for granting permission to work to asylum seekers who have waited six months for a decision on their asylum application; and for connected purposes Over the last few months, we have been enjoying returning to normal life—going to shops, on holiday, or to pubs and restaurants.",3
"Meanwhile, we have a willing resource within many of our communities: asylum seekers who have fled war, persecution and violence, coming here to build a new life.",3
"The problem is that, except in a small number of shortage occupations, asylum seekers are currently banned from working.",3
"That ban is a clear example of the Government’s hostile immigration environment—a hostility that includes criminalising those seeking refuge, with barbaric detention centres and GPS trackers.",3
"We could increase the workforce in areas of most need, allowing asylum seekers to take up roles as HGV drivers, baggage handlers and farm labourers, or even as civil servants, processing passport applications and driving licences.",3
"Instead of wasting stupid amounts of money on ineffective policies, it is time that this Government implemented policies that make economic sense, and the right to work is just that Currently, asylum seekers may apply for permission to work only if they have been waiting for a decision on their asylum claim for more than 12 months.",3
"According to the Government’s own statistics, 76% of people waiting for a decision on their asylum claim are now waiting for more than six months, and people are left with no other option than to claim asylum support of £5.84 per day.",3
"Those Home Office delays force people to live in utter poverty, and sadly, in such circumstances, some people become victims of trafficking Some would have us believe that asylum seekers are here to “scrounge off the state” and—paradoxically—to “steal all our jobs”.",3
"In truth, however, the vast majority of asylum seekers in this country are willing and committed to work, and to contribute.",3
"According to a survey by Lift The Ban, 94% of individuals with experience of the asylum system would work if they were given the chance to do so.",3
"The Bill simply asks that they are afforded that dignity Today, this Government continue to talk about making asylum claims through “safe and legal means” and about the so-called “pull factor” of the UK’s asylum system, although it is, in fact, one of the least generous in the western world.",3
"For most people seeking asylum, there are no safe and legal routes.",2
"The UK’s immigration rules make no provision for people to come, or apply to come to the UK to claim asylum.",4
"Home Office policy is explicit that for someone to claim asylum in the UK, they must already be in the UK.",4
We cannot embark on foreign wars without accepting our responsibility to those who are then displaced or forced to leave.,2
"Rather than interfere and then wash our hands of the resultant chaos, this Government could take seriously their responsibility by rebuilding such countries and supporting those who have left Working while awaiting an asylum decision would not only allow asylum seekers to function independently but facilitate language learning and the formation of bonds between people from different cultures.",3
"Early intervention, including access to the labour market, is crucial for the successful integration of refugees.",3
"The Government have hailed the post-Brexit era as one of “global Britain” that is both open and outward-looking, and giving those seeking sanctuary the chance to integrate into communities is crucial to delivering that promise.",3
"In the context of a global pandemic, a shambolic Brexit and a well-documented worker shortage, the untapped potential of asylum seekers is especially pertinent.",2
Are we really in a position where this Government would further damage the economy rather than soften their hard-line immigration policy?,3
"It makes little practical or political sense to prevent asylum seekers from working, and I hope Members across the House will join me in calling for the ban to be lifted.",3
"The admirable Families Together Coalition comprises not only the Refugee Council and British Red Cross but UNHCR, Amnesty International UK and Oxfam GB, as well as others I and my party colleagues have long been calling for the Government to expand their restrictive rules on family reunion for refugees and those with humanitarian protection, as have parliamentarians across the political spectrum.",3
"I must put at the top of that list my noble friend Lady Hamwee, who is not able to be here today but who introduced versions of this Bill twice in previous Sessions, and whose expertise and commitment to this cause and many others in the field of asylum and immigration have inspired me and continue to do so.",3
"I hope today will start a process of fourth time lucky for a Bill to expand refugee family reunion The Bill will enable child refugees to sponsor their parents and siblings, as well as expand the range of family members whom adult refugees are allowed to sponsor to include siblings, parents and adult dependent children.",3
"The Bill will ensure that everyone with refugee or humanitarian protection status in the UK can access family reunion, rather than constraining rights according to the way that they arrived in the UK, and will reintroduce legal aid for family reunion cases In the previous Session, at Second Reading I said that the Bill was timely; it is even more so now because recent events highlight its pertinence.",3
"We now have the example of the Government showing that they know that refugees need their families by acting quickly—albeit following a public outcry—to introduce the Ukraine family scheme, which allows Ukrainians in the UK to sponsor a wide range of extended family members, including grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces and children of any age.",3
"My Bill extends this proud tradition, ensuring that all those recognised as refugees or needing humanitarian protection in the UK are able to safely reunite with their loved ones on a fairly broad definition, though not as broad as the Ukrainian scheme.",3
The Ukraine family scheme shows clearly that the Government appreciate the point that new refugees are better able to integrate with the support of their family.,3
"Indeed, that is one main reason why refugee family reunion is a feature of asylum systems around the world—the other, of course, being that it is simply inhumane to keep families apart.",3
"Are the Government taking the wide definition of family under the Ukraine family scheme as a spur to the consideration of expanding family reunion for all refugees Permitting a refugee to be with their family will greatly improve their chance of leading a stable, well-integrated life without threats to their well-being and mental health.",3
"Imagine trying to move forward with your life and work while worrying about the safety of family back home Research from the British Red Cross, the Refugee Council, Save the Children and others consistently shows that refugees find it harder to integrate when they are plagued by such worries.",3
"One refugee child explained: “I am unable to concentrate on my studies and when I go home, I always think about them and at night I do not sleep.” Let us not forget that family unity may also save the public purse: it costs £30,000 a year to look after a child in a residential home or foster care who might be supported by parents or other relatives if they were allowed to come to the UK.",3
"What assessment have the Government made of the ability of unaccompanied refugee children to integrate in the UK given their lack of refugee family reunion rights As well as events in Ukraine, reports from Afghanistan have also highlighted the importance of family.",3
"Those refugees desperately need the opportunity to bring their families back together Afghan refugees received a government promise when Kabul was evacuated last August that their relatives would be able to join them but, 10 months later, 6,500 families find themselves unable to bring those relatives.",3
"What progress is being made to institute a free, accessible family reunion route for those Afghan refugees evacuated in August 2021 who are still waiting, fearing for the safety of loved ones My Bill seeks to change the present rule in the UK that child refugees are not allowed to sponsor any family members, not even their parents, while adult refugees are allowed to sponsor only their partners or their children under 18 via refugee family reunion.",3
"Organisations working with refugees in the UK regularly witness the pain that people face when separated from their adult children who do not currently qualify but are still at risk or are living in precarious situations Rather than taking action to bring refugee families together, the Home Secretary is restricting family reunion rights even further.",3
"On 28 June, many of the provisions of the Nationality and Borders Act came into effect, including a new provision that restricts access to family reunion for certain—so-called group 2—refugees according to how they have travelled to the UK.",3
"The Home Secretary asks us to believe that this harshness is necessary to deter unsafe channel crossings in small boats, but by restricting family reunion, all she is doing is driving vulnerable women and children into the hands of ruthless people smugglers In the past year, 6,000 people have arrived safely in the UK via refugee family reunion, more than 90% of whom were women and children.",3
"If the Home Secretary were serious about combating people smuggling and protecting vulnerable women and children, she would expand access to refugee family reunion.",3
What estimate have the Government made of a possible increase in dangerous journeys by women and children as result of restrictions on refugee family reunion in the Nationality and Borders Act The Home Secretary often cites as evidence of some kind of mischief that many asylum seekers who reach these shores are young men.,3
"The first thing to note about this is that the recognition rate for these claimants for asylum is an average of 75% at first instance, and half of those who appeal win their case, so the final rate of acceptance for refugee status is around 85%.",3
"The other thing to note is that of course it is their sons whom families send on dangerous journeys, both because they are more at risk at home from police violence, forced lifetime conscription as in Eritrea or recruitment to the Taliban, and because it would be inconceivable to place the well-being of a young daughter in the tender hands of the Taliban, the largely male smuggling gangs or a refugee camp.",3
"As Conservative MP and former Home Office Minister Caroline Nokes said in a debate on Afghanistan on 18 August last year: “Our children do not suddenly become independent because they pass a day over their 18th birthday, so refugee family reunion in this instance has to ensure that those girls are able to come here.",3
"New guidance on fee waivers says that the test for those applying for entry visas on family grounds, including where the sponsor is a refugee, is no longer exceptional circumstances but affordability.",3
"It is a pity that this sensible approach cannot be translated to the family reunion provisions of the Immigration Rules, which remain narrow and rigid The purpose of this Bill is, first, to expand the criteria of who qualifies as a family member for the purposes of refugee family reunion.",3
"Secondly, it gives refugee children in the UK the right to sponsor their family members to join them, as in almost every other European country.",3
"Thirdly, the Bill reintroduces legal aid for refugee family reunion cases.",3
"Fourthly, it requires respect for the refugee convention I imagine the Minister will again seek to deflect the case for this Bill by directing my attention not only to paragraph 319X of the Immigration Rules but to the discretion outside the rules.",3
Discretion does not give the same certainty as changed rules The Government regularly trot out the argument that giving refugee children the right to bring close family to join them in the same way as adults would be a pull factor.,3
"The advantages of restoring legal aid would accrue not only to the applicant but to the Government, since the modest cost of helping the system to function better—remember that the real problem in the Home Office is the enormous backlog—would actually save money When refugees arrive here in the UK having left loved ones behind, reuniting with their families is the very first thing on their minds.",3
"In the words of unaccompanied refugee children supported by Kent Refugee Action Network: “It feels as if a part of us is missing.” I think we can all understand that sentiment, that aching hole in their lives To conclude, the case for a more generous approach to family reunion for refugees is based on both the humanitarian case, which I contend is very strong, and the hard-headed case that reunited families allow refugees to find their feet more quickly, integrate better and contribute more fully, to the benefit of themselves, their community, our country and the Treasury.",3
"Both my noble friends have demonstrated tenacity and stamina in their attempts to improve the situation for refugees and asylum seekers It is bad enough to be a refugee fleeing persecution or war, such as those displaced by Putin’s dreadful illegal war in Ukraine, let alone to be separated from your family, not least if you are a child under 18.",3
"It is at times of danger and trauma that we need our families around us most, let alone when you are in a foreign country, where you may not even speak the language and are navigating a complex legal system on your own.",3
"The noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, reminded us of how we felt when we were separated from our families during the pandemic This very simple Bill puts some heart back into this country’s immigration policy when this Government have been doing everything they can to make it more difficult for people to claim asylum in the UK.",3
"As my noble friend said, the definition is not extended as far as that which was used in the Ukrainian refugee scheme.",3
Why was a broader definition adopted for Ukrainian refugees?,3
"If the Government will not support the Bill, what is the difference, as far as Ukrainian refugees are concerned?",3
"The Bill also restores eligibility for legal aid to make such an application The current rules are too restrictive if, for example, the sponsor of a child or partner has not yet received a decision on their asylum claim, or if the sponsor is under 18.",3
"As we heard, there is a mounting backlog of asylum claims that have yet to be decided, with some decisions extending into months and even years.",3
"An unaccompanied minor is in even more need of their family than a traumatised adult—yet the UK is almost alone in Europe in not allowing an unaccompanied asylum seeker to sponsor their family to join them, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham said.",3
"As my noble friend explained, there are some differences from last time, brought about, I expect, by the need to counter the truly dreadful Nationality and Borders Act—for example by ensuring that the Immigration Rules do not contravene the 1951 UN refugee convention and apply equally to all who are granted protection status, whether they are deemed to be group 1 or group 2 refugees under the 2022 Act.",3
"What inevitable “challenging burdens” would such a Bill create for the Home Office, local authorities and wider public services, when the Government allow over a million migrants to enter the UK to study or work in higher-paid jobs?",3
"Asylum seekers represent a tiny fraction of immigration into the UK, and any increase as a result of the Bill would be smaller still In 2020, according to the excellent briefing provided by the House of Lords Library, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration described the application process for family reunion as “potentially confusing”, in particular the guidance provided for applicants.",3
This Bill would address the coalition’s concerns as well My noble friend talked about how the visa fee waiver for family reunion is now based on affordability and said that that was progress.,3
"As we debated in the House on Wednesday, the affordability rules in themselves appear designed to deter anyone from applying, both because of the unreasonable definition of what is essential expenditure and the sheer complexity of the nature and extent of the proof required to show that the visa fee should be waived—perhaps two steps forward and one step back.",3
"The Government tell us—I was very interested to read the briefing note with its three points—that their objectives and plan for immigration are “To make the system fairer and more effective to better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum … To deter illegal entry into the UK breaking the business model of criminal trafficking networks and saving lives … To remove from the UK those with no right to be here.” Actually, who could disagree with those words?",3
"We all want to do those things, but I think it is fair to say that, beyond them, the position is unclear, confusing and not doing the job that the Government say they want to do I have been in this House for 12 years and have lost count of the number of immigration Bills that have come forward from the Government in that time.",3
"We had the Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme, the Hong Kong British national (overseas) visa, the Dubs scheme that has now been stopped, the gateway protection programme, the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme, the vulnerable children’s resettlement scheme and the UK resettlement scheme.",3
"If we do not do so, we will end up coming back here again and again to deal with issues that have not been solved and more immigration Bills that achieve very little.",3
I will read the accounts to which she referred because I would like to know more about them Many noble Lords referenced integration assessments.,3
It is for precisely this reason that the Government already have a comprehensive framework for reuniting refugees with their families here in the UK.,3
I remind noble Lords that this framework is set out in the Immigration Rules and our refugee family reunion policy The Government’s policy fully recognises that families can become fragmented because of the nature of conflict and persecution and the speed and manner in which those seeking protection are often forced to flee their own country; we have heard many such heartbreaking stories throughout this debate.,3
The family reunion policy allows those recognised as refugees or granted humanitarian protection in the UK to sponsor their spouse or partner and children under the age of 18 to join them here if the family unit was formed before their refugee sponsor fled their country of origin.,4
"This has seen more than 41,000 individuals reunited with their refugee family members since 2015—a significant number that highlights the policy’s success as a safe and legal route for families to reunite in the UK I would point out that not only is there no fee to make a refugee family reunion application, but sponsors are also not required to meet any financial or maintenance requirements to be reunited.",3
"This is extended to ensure that the immediate family of refugees can reunite here in the UK, without unnecessary barriers.",3
There are also existing rules in place for extended families of refugees in the UK to sponsor children where there are serious and compelling circumstances.,3
"Further, our policy is clear that refugees can sponsor adult-dependent relatives living overseas to join them where, due to circumstances such as age, illness or disability, that person requires long-term personal care that can be provided only by relatives here in the UK The Government recognise that some applicants do not meet the current rules.",3
"We refuse to play into the hands of criminal gangs, and therefore cannot extend this policy to allow child refugees to sponsor family members into the UK.",3
"Such a move would undoubtedly risk more children being encouraged, or even forced, to leave their families and risk hazardous, potentially life-threatening, journeys to the UK—potentially in the hands of criminal gangs I must also stress that while family unity is a key priority under this policy, your Lordships will appreciate that we have a range of aims further to this, including ensuring that we have reasonable control over immigration and that public services, such as schools and hospitals, are not placed under unreasonable pressure.",3
"The noble Lord, Lord Paddick, asked how, in that case, we could square it with granting a million visas for higher-paying jobs.",3
"However, I remind noble Lords that legal aid for refugee family reunion may already be available under the exceptional case funding scheme, where failure to provide legal aid would mean a breach or a risk of breach of the individual’s human rights, subject to means and merits tests.",3
In 2019 the Government amended the scope of legal aid so that separated migrant children are able to receive civil legal aid for applications by their family members and extended family members.,3
"As to who will be served with a notice, individuals who will be served with a slavery and trafficking information notice are those who have previously made a human rights or protection claim in respect of removal or refusal of entry.",3
"As I have said, we want to identify genuine victims of modern slavery or trafficking within this group as quickly as possible so that they receive both protection from removal and access to the support given during the recovery period This may not be the best form of providing statistics, but the number of those detained in the UK following immigration offences in 2020 was obviously affected by the pandemic.",3
"In 2019, only a small proportion, about 1%, of individuals detained in the UK following an immigration offence who made a national referral mechanism referral were returned.",3
"The reports are available on the government website but, to make it simpler, I will write to the noble Lords, Lord Coaker and Lord Alton, with a copy available, with the URL so they can find the relevant material I suggest it is right that we reduce the opportunities to misuse the system for immigration purposes and improve the efficiency of the processes, targeting resources where they are most needed to help victims recover from exploitation and rebuild their lives.",3
"We want to address concerns that some referrals are being made intentionally late in the process, to frustrate immigration action and divert resources away from legitimate claimants.",3
It is not right that foreign criminals subject to deportation and those who have absolutely no right to remain in the UK can seek to delay their removal by waiting until the very last minute before raising new claims or putting in endless evidence or information relating to their status in the UK.,3
"So what Clauses 57 and 58 seek to do is on the one hand ensure that vulnerable victims receive appropriate and timely support, and on the other hand enable investigative and enforcement activities to take place with reasonable dispatch I should point out—this did not feature too much in the debate—that Clauses 57 and 58 are underpinned by access to legal advice, under Clauses 65 and 66, to help individuals understand whether they are a potential victim of modern slavery or human trafficking, and to support a referral into the national referral mechanism if that is the case.",3
"I am grateful to my friend Professor Fiona Williams, an important researcher on this issue, and Kalayaan, to whom I pay tribute for all their work on behalf of migrant domestic workers and for their briefings As we have already heard, it is clear that the 2016 reforms are not working.",3
"Rather than listening to overseas domestic workers and reinstating the original ODW visa, the 2016 changes ignore the need for workers to be able to exercise their rights before exploitation escalates.",3
"If this abuse does not equate to trafficking, they could be left destitute, without a reasonable prospect of finding work and without access to public funds or legal aid to challenge mistreatment.",3
The desperate need to remit money to one’s family and pay off debts means that workers may not feel able to risk leaving exploitative labour situations Professor Williams argues that key to understanding the problems faced has been the shift from placing ODW protection within an employment and immigration rights frame to a trafficking frame.,3
She was offered shorter working hours and pay at the national minimum wage Jenny arrived in the UK last year on a visa.,3
"In contravention of UK published policy, she was issued no information on her rights as a worker in the UK, either during the visa application process or on arrival.",3
"Nevertheless, she did leave because she was exhausted from her long working hours for pay less than she had been promised Jenny approached Kalayaan when her visa had two weeks before it expired, having only just heard of the organisation.",3
"Kalayaan explained to her that her visa was non-renewable and that while she had permission to work in the UK, it would only be while her visa remained valid—for the next two weeks—after which she would be subject to the UK’s hostile/compliant environment for migrants.",3
"On the basis of Kalayaan’s assessment, it did not consider Jenny to be a victim of trafficking or slavery, so could not refer her to the NRM It is worth noting here that even cases that Kalayaan has judged appropriate for NRM referral are frequently turned down on the grounds that, while the working conditions may have breached employment terms, they do not constitute trafficking or slavery.",3
"Yet calls for the reinstatement of the original ODW visa are repeatedly met with the response that workers who have suffered abuse can avail themselves of the NRM Despite experiencing labour law violations, Jenny’s right to change employer was in practice of no use to her, given that she was not allowed to renew her visa.",3
"Had she entered the UK on the original kind of ODW visa, she would have remained visible to the authorities by renewing her visa annually, while contributing in taxes and visa renewal fees.",3
"Jenny’s case underlines how unhelpful it is to require maltreated migrant domestic workers to fit themselves into the slavery or trafficking frame, and how their rights would be better protected through the restoration of the original ODW visa Professor Williams also argues that the issue should be seen in an international context, where there have been very important advances in employment rights for domestic workers.",3
"Ironically, when the convention was voted on, the UK Government abstained on the grounds that the UK already had a progressive policy—the OWD visa—which they then went on to withdraw.",3
Will the Government therefore now rethink their position and restore the ODW visa without further delay?,3
"Amendment 174 would return rights to people in the UK who are on the overseas domestic workers visa—primarily, the right to change their employer and renew their visa for a period of not less than 12 months.",3
"The then coalition Government changed the visa regime in April 2012, so that workers and their immigration status are tied to their original employer, and their visa cannot be renewed past six months.",3
"The cross-party Joint Committee on the Draft Modern Slavery Bill, as it then was, said that the changes to the regime had “unintentionally strengthened the hand of the slave master against the victim of slavery.” It concluded: “Tying migrant domestic workers to their employer institutionalises their abuse; it is slavery, and is therefore incongruous with our aim to act decisively to protect the victims of modern slavery.” In 2015, the independent Ewins review called for all overseas domestic workers to be given the right to change employer and apply for further leave to remain in the UK for up to 30 months.",3
"It found that the terms of the domestic worker visa were “incompatible with the … protection of overseas domestic workers’ fundamental rights while in the UK” Unfortunately, the Government disagreed with the recommendation; instead, they made more limited changes to the Immigration Rules, with the effect that all domestic workers can change employer during their six-month visa, but only those who are found to be victims of trafficking or modern slavery can change employer and apply to stay for longer in the UK.",3
"We certainly support the thrust of Amendment 174 Amendment 181 would exempt international volunteers from paying the immigration health surcharge, and I await the Government’s response with interest.",3
"I would like to know what consideration the Government have given to extending the exemption, and have the Government met charities which have raised concerns about its effect on volunteering in particular sectors, especially social care Amendment 183, about which most has been said—with some feeling and fervour—would require the Government to suspend the tier 1 investor visa route, known as “golden visas”, until the review into those visas has been made public.",3
"In its 2020 Russia report, the Intelligence and Security Committee recommended that a key measure for “disrupting the threat posed by illicit Russian financial activity” is an “overhaul of the Tier 1 (Investor) visa programme—there needs to be a more robust approach” In March 2018, the Government announced a review of golden visas issued between 2008 and 2015.",3
"According to a freedom of information request in June 2021, the Home Office is reviewing 6,312 golden visas, half of all such visas ever issued, for a range of possible national security threats.",3
"Almost four years since the Government announced the review, and as has been said more than once this evening, the findings have not yet been reported Many of those who received visas during this period will have been eligible to apply for British citizenship over the past seven years, and it is surely essential that there is full transparency about the findings of the review, including: a detailed breakdown of how many visas have been revoked; how many cases have been referred to law enforcement; and how many applications for renewal or citizenship have been denied In the Commons last month, Stephen Kinnock MP asked the following question: “Six months ago, the Government said that they were finalising their report into how more than 700 Russian millionaires were fast-tracked for British residency via their so-called golden visa scheme.",3
Can the Foreign Secretary tell the House when that long-overdue report will be published?” The Foreign Secretary’s reply was: “We are reviewing the tier 1 visas that were granted before 5 April.,3
"It provides for a pre-entry clearance system which requires anyone who does not need a visa, entry clearance or other specified immigration status to obtain authorisation before travelling to the UK.",3
"The system will impact mainly non-visa nationals, including EU nationals, who can presently enter the UK visa-free for set periods.",3
Almost all such persons are presently automatically considered to have deemed leave to enter the UK when crossing into Northern Ireland on the land border.,3
"I spoke also to the Committee on the Administration of Justice, and my noble friend Lord Coaker and I spoke to representatives of the Irish Government based in the Irish embassy, who are deeply concerned about the impact of Clause 71 on tourism, not only in the Republic of Ireland but in Northern Ireland —for those people who come in to have a holiday via Shannon and Dublin airports and then move northwards It appears that the UK Government intend the scheme to apply on the land border and, so far, are dismissive of concerns raised.",3
"The clause shows a total lack of understanding of the border, which has many crossings.",3
"The noble Lord, Lord Patten of Barnes, who served in Northern Ireland as a former Minister and was chair of the Patten commission on policing, will be well aware of the geography not only of Northern Ireland but of the border area.",3
"I am sure that he would very clearly see the issues involved The situation for some time has been that almost all EU, EEA and non-EEA citizens who are non-visa nationals present in the Republic of Ireland can cross the land border freely on local journeys into Northern Ireland without any requirement for prior immigration permission.",4
"In some ways, the Bill conflates modern slavery issues with immigration, as well as with the necessities of an economy and tourism.",3
"It has been the case for some time that citizens who are non-visa nationals present in the Republic of Ireland can cross the land border freely on local journeys into Northern Ireland, without any requirement for prior immigration permission.",4
"For EU-EEA citizens since Brexit, as was already the case with other non-visa nationals, permission in such circumstances is restricted to entry as a visitor and certain activities, such as work, are restricted when entering the UK this way.",4
"However, this system has allowed non-visa nationals resident in border areas in the Republic of Ireland to enter Northern Ireland freely for a range of activities, even visiting family members or for work purposes.",3
"I am aware of people who do that; they contribute to the economy in the Republic but have family in the north, and vice versa Under this new proposal, non-visa nationals resident in the Republic of Ireland will be required to apply in advance and pay for an ETA before crossing the border into Northern Ireland.",3
"It is clear that this will have a detrimental impact on non-visa nationals who need to enter Northern Ireland for activities such as visiting family, accessing childcare, carrying out permitted work engagements and accessing services and goods.",3
This system will also impact the ability of members of the migrant community to take part freely in cross-border projects and programmes.,3
"I am sure the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, living in County Fermanagh, will be well aware of these issues for people who are resident or working in Counties Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal Concerns have also been raised about the impact of the ETA system on business, health and tourism, plus recreational issues, as it would require non-visa nationals in the Republic of Ireland to obtain an ETA before a visit to Northern Ireland, a fact that has been recognised and raised directly with the Home Office by the Irish Government.",3
"My noble friend Lord Coaker will be aware of this from his time as shadow Secretary of State, when I travelled with him round the constituency of South Down In the context of an invisible land border that British and Irish citizens can freely cross, it is eminently foreseeable that many other persons who have hitherto been able similarly to cross the border without any prior permission will be largely unaware of the ETA requirement.",3
Will there be any other exemptions or special arrangements for people crossing the land border frequently from the Republic of Ireland It would be preferable if ETA requirements did not exist or were not applied when travelling from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland.,4
"We should always remember that the Belfast/Good Friday agreement states that people can identify themselves as “and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose.” For my part, I hold an Irish passport.",4
They have a long and distinguished history of service to the UK both here and overseas.,4
"For a number of years, application fees for immigration and nationality applications have been charged under powers set out under Section 68 of the Immigration Act 2014.",3
"They play a vital role in our country’s ability to run a sustainable migration and borders system, reducing the burden on taxpayers.",3
"This system ensures that there are checks and balances within the system, and maintains the coherence of the immigration fees framework as it is set out in legislation.",3
"I will come back to this subject in a moment When non-UK service personnel, including Commonwealth citizens and Gurkhas from Nepal, enlist in the regular Armed Forces, they are granted “exempt from immigration control” status for the duration of their service to allow them to come and go without restriction.",4
"They are therefore free from any requirements to make visa applications or pay fees while they serve, unlike almost every other category of migrant coming to work in the UK Those who have served at least four years or been medically discharged as a result of their service can choose to settle in the UK after their service and pay the relevant fee.",4
"Those applying for themselves do not have to meet an income requirement, be sponsored by an employer or meet any requirements regarding skills, knowledge of the English language or knowledge of life in the UK, again putting them in a favourable position compared to other migrants wishing to settle here.",3
We should bear in mind that not all countries allow dual citizenship.,4
"However, as I have explained, there is an existing legal framework in place for immigration fees which already enables proper consideration to be given by government and Parliament to the full range of issues in setting those fees.",3
"Does the Minister now recognise that it is vital that we have closer co-operation with the EU so that we can address our common interests, whether in foreign affairs or defence, more effectively?",3
Surely it is crystal clear that this must now happen Does the Minister also recognise that European countries have welcomed refugees with open arms but we have simply put up barriers in their way?,3
Are the Government not ashamed of the paltry number of visas issued?,3
"I think of all those homes offered by the British people, yet few refugees are allowed through.",4
Will the noble Lord tell us exactly how many Ukrainian visas have now been granted?,3
What are we doing to close loopholes that may be used in the overseas territories Are the Government working with others to try to get trusted information into Russia?,3
"I hope they will not just praise the BBC World Service, as they did in the integrated review, while at the same time undermining it at home There are of course major consequences of this crisis.",3
"I have already outlined why we have the visa requirement, although in the case of children, that is more focused on safeguarding the children.",3
"There is a real issue, particularly if unaccompanied minors leave Poland and the other border countries.",2
"Again in relation to unaccompanied minors, as I have stated at the Dispatch Box on previous occasions, the Ukrainian Government have a strong policy position on unaccompanied children who are travelling being placed into the care of foreigners without their consent.",3
"The visa process is about that, but even then, for actual travel to the United Kingdom people do need documents to be able to board planes.",4
"In some cases, if they do not have a passport or any other document, it is the FAV with the vignette on it that actually gives them the ability to board a plane.",3
"My Lords, if I may, I shall speak first to my Amendment 20, to create an exception to the ending of Cart JRs in cases where the refusal of permission to appeal the decision of the Upper Tribunal “is likely to lead to the deportation of the applicant to a country where the applicant is likely to be tortured or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment” In such cases, the Cart JR of that refusal is the last hope that an applicant has.",3
"In the case of G and H against the Upper Tribunal and the Home Secretary in 2016, reported in EWHC 239, Mr Justice Walker considered the case of a Nigerian woman, G, who was a victim of FGM and sex trafficking, who also had a child, H The Home Secretary’s decision to deport G and H was appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.",3
"It was common ground that, before coming to the UK, G had been the victim of FGM and sex trafficking.",3
"In that case, the petitioner was a Venezuelan who came to the UK with his wife and young son in 2017, seeking asylum after his friend had been shot in the face by members of the Venezuelan armed forces while they were protesting together.",3
"In overturning the refusal, the Court of Session held that the Upper Tribunal had misapplied the law and misunderstood the effect of the evidence We know that the vast majority of Cart JRs—92.4% from 2013 to 2020—involve immigration and asylum cases.",3
"We also know that a very high proportion of those involve deportation orders and that those orders are often to countries where the country guidance issued by the UK Visas and Immigration section of the Home Office indicates that there is a very high risk of maltreatment on return, not necessarily by the authorities—although often they may be the source of the danger or condone it—but often by traffickers or criminal elements within the countries concerned The Government’s arguments—and those of the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, and his committee—in favour of Clause 2 rest largely, first, on the high resources in money and judicial time said to be consumed by Cart JRs and, secondly, on their apparent low success rate.",3
"We do not have the exact statistics on settlement, but I invite the Minister to write to me before Report setting out how many of the applications where permission has been granted have been settled, how many have involved deportation orders, and in how many cases such deportation orders have not been implemented as a result of a challenge being lodged I have also added my name to Amendment 19 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, which would permit Cart JRs where the Upper Tribunal acts in reliance on a fundamental error of law.",3
"Together, the amendments would place restrictions on who could be accommodated in the accommodation centres proposed under Clause 12 and for how long, the numbers to be accommodated in a centre and the sleeping arrangements, and would ensure that if children were ever accommodated in those centres, they would not be prevented from attending local maintained schools Under Clause 12, as signalled in the new plan for immigration, accommodation for asylum seekers will move from what has been the dominant dispersal model, in which asylum seekers are housed in local communities, to accommodation in reception centres, using a power provided by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.",3
"What criteria will be used to decide whether such existing sites are designated as accommodation centres or contingency accommodation What the Government have made clear is that they will use Napier as asylum accommodation for a further five years, and that this will allow testing and piloting to inform the final design of how accommodation centres will operate.",3
"In view of the High Court judgment about the inadequacy of the accommodation provided, and having sat on an inquiry held by the APPG on immigration detention into quasi-detention centres, I find the idea that Napier could provide the model for future accommodation centres profoundly worrying The evidence we received—both from stakeholder organisations and from those with experience of living in Napier or in another centre, now closed—was overwhelmingly negative.",3
It is not conducive to integration.,3
"It warns that the use of such centres is likely to lead to increased harassment of asylum seekers As noted in the joint evidence from Doctors of the World, the Helen Bamber Foundation, Forrest Medico-Legal Services and Freedom from Torture, the use of dormitory-style accommodation means a total lack of privacy.",3
"As a dozen organisations, including Doctors of the World, the Helen Bamber Foundation, the BMA and various royal colleges warned the Home Secretary in a joint letter, this makes them inappropriate for people seeking asylum.",3
They also warned that the kind of accommodation centres envisaged represent a real public health risk and impede adequate medical care It was clear from our inquiry and from the experience of a range of health and refugee organisations that such accommodation is bad for mental and physical health.,3
"According to the Helen Bamber Foundation, “the use of institutional accommodation of this type is extremely harmful to survivors of torture” and its features “have the same impact as open prisons with groups of people with little to motivate or occupy themselves becoming increasingly desperate.” It is not surprising, therefore, that the Refugee Council has warned: “Proposals to extend these forms of accommodation are ill-thought out and dangerous, and undermine the UK’s duties to support and protect those making asylum claims.” It advised that international examples of the use of congregated settings, including in the Republic of Ireland, have shown that this kind of accommodation is completely inappropriate for housing those seeking asylum The amendments will not prevent the use of such accommodation centres—the power for which stems from earlier legislation, as I said—but they would go so way towards addressing their most inhumane features.",3
"The larger such centres are, the less the residents feel that their humanity is recognised and the more likely the centres are to attract hostile attention and to work against social cohesion and integration.",3
"In the Commons Committee, the Minister said that such a limit would undermine a key objective of resolving asylum cases more quickly on site.",3
This reflects a recommendation made five years ago by the Home Affairs Select Committee—that room-sharing should be phased out across the asylum estate.,3
"It would help address lack of privacy and public health concerns The Minister was rather dismissive of this in the Commons Committee, but he did not seem to appreciate what it is like for people seeking asylum to be housed in dormitory-style accommodation, as opposed to sharing a bedroom in accommodation in the community.",3
"The UNHCR has expressed concern that, unless there are necessary safeguards and support services, prolonged accommodation in such centres is likely to harm well-being, increase the need for future support and delay refugee integration.",3
I did not sleep at all … It reminded me of [my home country] and I could not function.” Another suggested: “It would be difficult to design a system that more perfectly delivers despair and deteriorating human health and mental capacity than these asylum camps.” A third said: “I did not feel like a person when I was there.” These quotes show quite clearly the experience of dehumanisation.,3
It also made it clear that it was imperative that the Government learn from the poor treatment of asylum seekers housed in former military barracks.,3
"I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, for her detailed exposition of the negative impact that accommodation has on the health and well-being of asylum seekers We have Amendments 58, 62 and 63 in this group, which are about accommodation centres, which are—if the Government were honest about this—immigration detention centres, as the noble Lord, Lord Cashman, said.",3
"The noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, will be heartened by the news in the Telegraph today that the Secretary of State “is in talks with the Attorney-General about potential restrictions that could be placed on their movements”— that is, the movements of asylum seekers housed in accommodation centres.",3
"The noble Lord will be heartened; we will be horrified We have already seen from the Government’s attempts to warehouse large numbers of asylum seekers in former military camps how such an approach is not “conducive to the public good”, to adopt a phrase from another part of the Bill.",3
"In the same article in the Telegraph today, apparently the Home Office confirmed that it has acquired military barracks at Manston, in order to accommodate further asylum seekers The noble Lord, Lord Horam, suggested that there was no objection in practice to accommodation centres.",3
"To some extent, that is true, but having large numbers of asylum seekers in one place creates tensions with local communities and hampers asylum seekers’ attempts to integrate into their adopted country.",2
"While I am on the subject of the noble Lord, Lord Horam, can we nail the illegal immigrant issue?",3
The noble Lord said that a lot of these asylum seekers had yet to have their claim determined.,3
"These people are not illegal immigrants unless and until their claim for asylum has been rejected So many objections to immigration generally are on the basis that immigrants do not integrate into society; that they do not attempt to learn the language, for example, or mix with those already established in the UK.",3
Accommodation centres would prevent asylum seekers integrating and force them to isolate themselves from local communities.,2
"It is the very opposite of what we should be doing to ensure the integration that is so important to foster good community and race relations As the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, said, we have seen the appalling conditions that asylum seekers have been forced to live in at Napier barracks, which drew universal condemnation.",3
"Amendments 56, 57 and 61 seek to provide some safeguards and protections for the most vulnerable asylum seekers.",3
"Amendment 60 would enable children housed in accommodation centres to attend local state schools, and Amendments 58 and 59 try to restrict the length of time that asylum seekers can be held in accommodation centres.",3
"As has been discussed, this aims, quite rightly, to introduce the right to work for asylum seekers who have been in the UK for more than six months My noble friend the Minister will know the gist of my argument from my comments on Tuesday.",3
It is exactly the sort of policy that should underpin global Britain’s new immigration system This is a moment when we have to decide who we are as a nation.,3
We want an immigration system that takes back control—one where the British people can see that we are trying to manage our borders and are actually doing so.,3
"I note that all wings of the Conservative and Labour Parties, the Liberal Democrats, other Cross-Benchers and the Deputy Prime Minister support the extension of the right to work for asylum seekers The arguments for this right to work are overwhelming.",3
"First, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said, the latest figures show that 125,000 people are waiting for asylum decisions.",3
It makes no sense whatever for asylum seekers who can drive HGVs or serve in the NHS to be forced to sit around doing nothing for over a year while they await a decision from the Home Office.,3
"The noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, made that point very powerfully Secondly, there is very persuasive evidence that the right to work has a large, positive impact on the integration of asylum seekers who successfully settle.",3
"As other noble Lords have already mentioned, the Government’s Migration Advisory Committee recently underlined that shorter waiting times have a large, positive impact on long-term employment outcomes for asylum seekers.",3
Reforms to the asylum system proposed through the Nationality and Borders Bill will take time to come into full effect.,3
"In the interim, while asylum cases are being processed, the asylum system continues to be under considerable strain.",3
"By offering asylum seekers the right to work, the Government would take pressure off themselves I anticipate that the Minister and other colleagues might be inclined to respond to this amendment using the pull factors argument, and I know others have addressed it.",3
"First, it is push factors such as war and famine which drive refugees to these shores, not pull factors.",2
The Migration Advisory Committee underlined that there is no evidence in academic research that people decide to claim asylum based on these kinds of factors.,3
"The Home Office commissioned a study, which others have mentioned, that also shows that there is little evidence of this All of this is to say that I believe the Government could quite legitimately, without nervousness and in line with their poverty strategy for families working their way out of poverty, adopt this amendment that allows asylum seekers to work after six months of being in the UK.",3
"My Lords, as my noble friend Lady Hamwee explained, Clause 17 has the potential for time limits to be placed on the submission of evidence in support of an asylum claim.",3
"I accept it is not a perfect analogy, because we have already established that asylum seekers are not illegal immigrants and, as my noble friend Lady Hamwee said, this should be an inquisitorial process not an adversarial one In this context, a notice served on a claimant saying something along the lines of “It may harm your claim if you do not provide evidence in support of your claim as soon as it is becomes available” seems reasonable.",3
"These too set an arbitrary deadline that must be complied with—in this case, after which a person is liable to be removed and deported.",3
"I say that, but Clause 20(4) says: “A priority removal notice remains in force … even if the PRN recipient ceases to be liable to … deportation” Amendment 87 asks why that is.",3
I think I speak for the whole House in thanking everyone stepping up to support people fleeing the conflicts in Afghanistan and Ukraine This Bill is about delivering a long-term solution to the long-term problems that have beset the asylum system over decades.,3
"It has three central objectives: to make the system fairer and more effective so we can better protect and support those in genuine need; to deter illegal entry, breaking the business model of evil criminal trafficking; and to make it easier to remove those with no right to be here The reforms we are introducing through this Bill have been debated at length both in this House and the other place, and I want to put on record my thanks to all Members for the rigour with which they have scrutinised the measures we have proposed.",3
We have amended the Bill to clarify that new measures to tackle people smugglers will not criminalise those acting under the direction of Her Majesty’s Coastguard.,3
"We have also introduced an amendment to resolve the lawful residence issue that has troubled many individuals with indefinite leave to remain under the EU settlement scheme and who wish to naturalise but have not previously held comprehensive sickness insurance In response to the appalling situation in Ukraine, we have added new powers to enable us to impose visa penalties on countries posing a threat to international peace and security or whose actions lead, or are likely to lead, to armed conflict or a breach of humanitarian law.",3
"We have also announced an expansion of the Hong Kong British national overseas route, which will enable individuals aged 18 or over who were born on or after 1 July 1997 and have at least one BNO parent to apply to the route independently Before going further, I would like to say something more about the situation in Ukraine, in particular the calls we have heard in respect of unaccompanied children.",3
"Manuscript copies of the updated notes have been distributed, but I accept that they should have been published online on Friday, and I am sorry that this did not happen—for that discourtesy I genuinely am apologetic, Mr Speaker On amendment 1, relating to access to British overseas territories citizenship and British citizenship for Chagossians, I again place on record my sympathy with the Chagossians for how they were treated in the 1960s and 1970s.",3
"In doing that, we are satisfied that the Chagossian diaspora is unique and we are not setting a precedent that would undermine the general principles governing the acquisition of British citizenship by descent.",3
"I have said this several times in the House, and it bears repeating now, that people getting in small boats to come to the United Kingdom are coming from perfectly safe countries at great risk, and they are lining the pockets of evil criminal gangs, which funds wider criminality, when there are fully functional and appropriate asylum systems, where people can gain help and support, that they are leaving to make those perilous journeys.",3
Gentleman is a particularly keen advocate of the European Union and wishes we were a member of it—that it is a fundamental feature of the common European asylum system that people should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.,4
"Without any enforcement of that, we simply encourage criminal smugglers to continue to exploit vulnerable migrants and leave flows of migrants across Europe, which culminate in the dangerous channel crossings.",3
"We always work in the asylum system and in the immigration space on a case-by-case basis, but I want to assure hon.",4
"Members that we will continue to uphold our international obligations and ensure that any removal is compliant with our obligations under the refugee convention and article 3 of the European convention on human rights, which protects against torture and inhuman and degrading treatment I am aware that there has been speculation recently about the potential costs of, and possible locations for, overseas asylum claim processing.",3
"This is a single global approach to family reunion, which does not encourage what are often dangerous journeys into Europe, facilitated by smugglers and traffickers.",3
"Similarly, amendment 11 would commit the UK to resettling at least 10,000 refugees each year Our view has long been that the number of refugees and people in need of protection that we resettle each year must be based on our capacity, our assessment of the international situation and our ability to care for people properly when they come to the UK.",3
"Members are seeking assurances that our doors will remain open to those in need, but I respectfully suggest that what is really needed to deliver refugee resettlement is not a number but an approach—an approach that is compassionate and flexible.",3
That is exactly what the Government are delivering through our new plan for immigration.,3
"I rise to support Lords amendment 11, but I want to start by thanking Ministers for their flexibility in accepting the logic of the amendment I moved at an earlier stage to extend the benefits of the British national overseas scheme to younger Hong Kong residents born after 1997.",3
"That is a good result, so in the same spirit of pragmatic and sensible co-operation, let me try again with the Lords amendment that would set up a permanent safe route that crucially, from the Government’s own perspective, would remove a significant driver of the traffic in small boats across the channel I absolutely get that one of the Government’s key aims is to minimise and hopefully stop altogether this dangerous route of illegal immigration.",3
"The Government, and indeed the Minister in his opening remarks, have correctly asserted that people in need of protection must come to the UK via safe and lawful routes rather than making an illegal journey.",3
"However, those routes need to be available to people, and for far too many people, they are simply not available under the current system The Minister went through the details of the resettlement pathway, and in the explanatory notes to the Bill the Government assert that they intend “to enhance resettlement routes to continue to provide pathways for refugees to be granted protection in the UK” But this resettlement route can be an effective response to the challenge of the channel crossings, of which there were about 28,000 last year, and break the model of the criminal people smugglers, only if it achieves two things.",3
"However, the Home Office data confirms that 87% of those arriving by small boats in 2021 comprised nationals from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, for whom there is currently no alternative legal and safe route by which they can apply to get to the UK, so it is pointless the Minister saying that he believes in accessible routes.",3
"As my constituents reach across borders to help and house those fleeing the war in Ukraine, this Government are sowing division by making an insidious distinction between “good” and “bad” refugees—a division that we should all completely reject.",3
"That is why I rise today to support amendments 4 to 9, especially amendment 6 Clause 11 makes a totally spurious division between group 1 and group 2 refugees that flies in the face of the 1951 refugee convention.",3
"The convention clearly states that refugees, wherever they come from, “shall enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination.” The Government know that there are no visa or pre-entry clearances for someone wishing to claim refuge.",4
"There is no such thing as an illegal refugee in international law, yet that is exactly what the new group 2 category attempts to establish.",3
"All clause 11 seeks to do is lazily turn far-right talking points about asylum seekers and refugees into legislation, without seriously thinking through any of the consequences for the people involved For example, currently people fleeing war can apply for humanitarian protection leave.",3
"However, the Government are scrapping humanitarian protection as we know it and aligning it instead with the new group 2 status, meaning regular visa reviews every two and a half years compared with every five, no recourse to public funds, no right to work, restricted family visa rights and no route to indefinite leave to remain.",3
"Those rights were brought in through an EU directive that became British law, and now the Government are using the smokescreen of this Bill to remove them, all by aligning them with a faulty two-tier refugee system.",3
Why are the Government not willing to accept Lords amendment 5 and put the 1951 refugee convention into the Bill?,3
"Ministers have yet to explain, despite having been asked several times in this debate, how the UK, which is surrounded by water, could ever possibly be the first safe country of arrival for someone seeking asylum without proper paperwork.",3
Political human rights defenders from Eritrea are not provided with exit visas and passports by their Government.,2
"They have to run across the border at night in case they get shot, and then hope to God that they can get to a safe country such as the United Kingdom, where there is already an expat community.",4
Exactly how putting asylum seekers into the prison system represents value for money for taxpayers is completely beyond me That is why the House should vote to retain Lords amendment 7 extending the right to work to asylum seekers.,3
"As if the current system is not dehumanising enough for individual asylum seekers, being denied the right to work actively harms wider society.",2
"I pay particular tribute to the Maryhill Integration Network, based in Glasgow North, for championing this amendment and becoming not just a provider of vital services to the local migrant population but an authoritative national voice on the rights of refugees and asylum seekers The House should also support the amendment tabled by Lord Alton, one of the finest minds and voices in the upper Chamber, that seeks to ensure that applicants for asylum who are at risk of being killed in a genocide can claim asylum in the UK.",3
It is clear that this Government are determined to strip away from the Bill any vestige of compassion or recognition of vulnerability on the part of asylum seekers that the Lords have managed to shoehorn into it.,3
"I hope we divide on every single amendment before us and that when they have to cancel their dinners, receptions and all their other engagements this evening, they think about what it must be like to travel on a small boat and to be in the hands of people-traffickers.",3
"Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Tahir Ali) just said, that there is not an ounce of compassion in this country for supporting refugees fleeing from conflict.",3
"The fact is that systems are often clunky and bureaucratic, and we need to improve that, but there is a factor that applies when we consider mass migration and asylum in our times.",2
We are trying to manage hard borders in an age of free trade and mass migration.,2
We are facing enormous pressures on our borders Beyond the remit of this Bill is our foreign engagement.,3
"I also think we need to accept more refugees into this country in the years ahead—not more economic migrants, except for those who are highly skilled and able to make a significant contribution, but certainly more refugees I want to speak briefly in support of the sponsorship scheme that the Government have introduced, which is so good as a model.",3
"Rather than Government and councils being responsible for identifying migrants and admitting them into this country, we are inviting communities themselves to take the lead, and I find it surprising that Opposition Members, who object so strenuously to bureaucracy and faceless systems, want the Government to match refugees with sponsors.",3
"Members around the House will have noticed the inspiring example in eastern Europe of communities reaching out to refugees, which is all self-organising and shows that it does not need Government to match people How do we do this securely?",3
"It is a terrible incentive for people to take dangerous trips across the channel, it is unjust to legal migrants and refugees, and it is wrong for the citizens who live here.",2
"We have a moral obligation to illegal migrants to save their lives if they undertake these dangerous journeys, to treat them with absolute decency when they get here and then to return them to the back of the queue.",3
"The effect will be to deter this dangerous and illegal crossing We must do more to deter people smuggling, which is why I support the measures in the Bill to introduce stronger penalties for people who break into this country, much stronger penalties against the smugglers who bring them over, more power and resources for our Border Force, including opportunities to return to France if that can be done safely, and more power to remove illegal immigrants I will finish with two quick conclusions.",3
"First, I think we need more use of the community sponsorship route as the default model for refugee resettlement.",3
"I believe in the generosity and compassion of local communities in this country, and I believe that community sponsorship is the most effective way to accommodate refugees and asylum seekers in our country.",3
"Secondly, to ensure the security of our borders, I wonder whether we should consider a new Department for borders that looks after visas, asylum and security.",3
"It would allow the Secretary of State to deprive a person of their British citizenship without notice, and it is right that the Lords chose to remove the clause entirely from the Bill Lords amendment 9 would stop overseas asylum processing.",3
"Friend the Member for Aberavon (Stephen Kinnock), and other Opposition Members, in Australia the offshore processing cost is estimated to be Aus $1 billion a year to deal with 300 migrants.",3
"I would like to add my voice to this by saying that I do not think it is in our country’s best interest to have overseas asylum processing On Lords amendment 10, Britain has a proud history of offering sanctuary to vulnerable unaccompanied children, but the Government ended the Dubs scheme and have not replaced it.",3
"In the other place, Labour rightly voiced concerns that clause 39 would criminalise everyone who arrives in the UK to claim asylum.",3
"The clause will have wider implications for all asylum seekers, not only people making irregular channel crossings.",3
"It is time the Government recognised that they need to treat refugees humanely, not as a problem they need to solve by criminalising them Can the Minister therefore answer me this?",3
"If a Ukrainian family enters the UK without a visa in the hope of being granted asylum, will the Government’s proposal mean they are guilty of a criminal offence punishable by up to four years in prison?",3
"We have heard repeatedly in this House and in the other place about how it will criminalise refugees who are seeking routes to safety, arriving on our shores against tremendous odds, and how it will create refugee camps on faraway islands—hidden from view, inaccessible and outside regular jurisdiction The Bill seeks to expand the powers of the Home Office to unprecedented levels to permit the deprivation of citizenship at the flick of a pen—a move that will undoubtedly discriminate against black and immigrant communities, further deepening the hostile environment that has already proven so damaging.",3
"It seeks to criminalise the very act of seeking asylum by inventing “illegal” routes to accessing our shores and seeking safety and protection, creating a two-tier system for refugees that breaks our obligations under international law and the refugee convention.",3
I have nothing but the utmost pride in workers and volunteers in the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and our border forces and in the incredible work of the PCS union in defying the Government’s instructions to push boats back into the channel.,3
"The Trades Union Congress has called on the Government to go further by suspending deportation flights until they have addressed the miscarriages of justice in the immigration system, and by scrapping in its entirety this Bill, which will breach international human rights law and increase worker exploitation The Lords amendments are supported by the vast majority of Liverpool, Riverside constituents, trade unions, human rights organisations and international bodies that work to support refugees every single day.",3
"I am very proud that my city, Liverpool, is a city of sanctuary and is happy to support refugees, but we still have 730 Afghan refugees languishing in hotels I conclude by reminding hon.",3
Members that there are 84 million refugees globally.,3
"Currently, illegal economic migrants are entering this country across the English channel from a safe mainland European country, France.",3
"That situation is totally unacceptable to the people of Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke, because they believe in fairness and they believe in doing things by the book People with a legitimate claim to come to our country to escape persecution and flee for their lives are being put at the bottom of the list because of people who are illegally entering our country via small boats—and what do the Opposition parties think?",3
"It thinks that they are thick and uncompassionate, despite the fact that we are the fifth largest contributor to the asylum dispersal scheme in our United Kingdom.",3
"The out-of-touch wokerati on the Opposition Benches are constantly obsessed with being popular with Twitter and Londoners, so this does not surprise me one bit As for the Scottish National party, only one Scottish local authority takes part in the asylum dispersal scheme.",3
"The Minister is on the Front Bench: let SNP Members go and sign the paperwork with him, and let us get refugees into local authority areas in Scotland.",3
The Nationality and Borders Bill is the vehicle for the new plan for immigration.,3
That is how we will address the challenge of illegal migration for the first time in over two decades through comprehensive reform of our asylum system.,3
"Illegal migration is facilitated by evil people smugglers, and the British public despise those people smugglers and want their Government to act to remove foreign criminals as well as deal with the whole issue of illegal migration.",3
"The Bill will mean that we can better protect and support those in need of asylum, deter illegal and dangerous routes of entry to the UK and, of course, remove more easily those with no right to be here.",3
"It is important that we work with our EU partners, particularly at the moment, and that we are a united force in efforts to support Ukraine and to support the refugees fleeing from Ukraine.",3
"I updated the House yesterday on the number of visas issued, which as of yesterday morning was 1,305.",3
"UK law enforcement and criminal justice partners also continue to co-operate via EU agencies Europol and Eurojust, including on issues such as small boats.",3
"Processing of PNR data during 2021 enabled the disruption of several hundred attempts by organised immigration crime groups to facilitate the illegal entry of individuals to the UK on scheduled flights Since the committee’s report was published, a number of the outstanding issues the committee noted have been resolved.",3
"My Lords, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration says that he has seen no impact of the Rwanda policy on numbers attempting to cross the channel in small boats.",3
The civil servant in charge of the Home Office says that he has not seen any evidence to show that the plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda will act as a deterrent.,3
Israel tried the same policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda and it failed.,3
When will the Government admit that their Rwanda policy is less about stopping people smugglers transporting people across the channel and has everything to do with the UK abdicating its moral responsibility to give genuine asylum seekers sanctuary in this country and its legal responsibilities under the UN refugee convention?,3
"My Lords, I too thank the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for initiating this debate and for being absolutely consistent in the message that he has put across in numerous debates over the last couple of years—namely, the need for us to be consistent as a country in our policy on human rights and refugees It is now over 70 years since the refugee convention was ratified and, with 82 million people still displaced, the international co-operation is as strong as ever.",3
"The noble Lord, Lord Purvis, is absolutely right: it is not just refugees who move countries; internally displaced people are a huge issue.",3
We should focus more on that A commitment in last year’s integrated review was the shortly-to-be-published international development strategy.,3
"The global refugee crisis requires a joined-up strategic approach As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said today and in the debate on the international development strategy just before Christmas, the best way to help people is to ensure that they can have a better life in the countries from which they originate.",3
I hope the Minister will reassure us that he will urge the Thai Government to provide the necessary humanitarian assistance following the violence which has resulted in that wave of refugees.,3
"We also need to strengthen and better resource the UNHCR and to accelerate applications for Myanmar nationals in countries where they are at risk of being deported back to Myanmar As we have heard in the debate, particularly from the noble Lord, Lord Alton, the United Kingdom’s domestic policy towards refugees and asylum seekers is broken.",3
"On asylum accommodation, the Government are increasingly looking towards dehumanising options, including sending people to offshore processing sites.",3
"Meanwhile, the High Court ruling that the Home Office’s decision to house asylum seekers in Napier barracks was unlawful was a shameful verdict for the Home Secretary Unfortunately, processing and accommodation are only the tip of the iceberg.",3
A failure to solve the problem of dangerous boat crossings is putting lives at risk and is a wider symptom of the Government’s inability to offer safe routes of passage.,3
"As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said in his opening remarks, the UN refugee agency estimates that the number of forcibly displaced people rose to a record-breaking 82 million during 2020.",3
"In 2010, that figure was one in every 159 people, so there is little wonder that the international humanitarian system is under strain Crises are also becoming increasingly protracted, with around three-quarters of all refugees displaced for more than five years.",3
"Indeed, we spent more than £10 billion on overseas development assistance last year, making us the third-largest donor in the G7.",3
"I do not think it is out of place to say that there is a strong feeling that, as soon as those conditions are met, we must immediately return to 0.7% Displaced people are, of course, a huge priority for our overseas aid and for the international development community.",3
"We have led the way in forging innovative solutions to refugee crises, championing a longer-term approach, and helping shape the Global Compact on Refugees, including with our pioneering responses in Jordan and Ethiopia The UK is one of the largest donors to the agencies working on the front line.",3
"We provided £29 million in core funding last year to the UN refugee agency, £25 million to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and £37 million to the World Food Programme.",3
"Our focus is on a holistic approach, restoring dignity and offering refugees a viable future while supporting their hosts.",3
"It aims to help refugees stay near their homes and to support host communities by investing in education, job creation and economic growth.",3
"Our commitment to the global compact is reflected in our country programmes, including our contribution of more than £320 million to the Rohingyas in Bangladesh since the crisis began four years ago, which has provided life-saving food, healthcare and sanitation for refugees.",3
"In response to this, we have provided more than £2 billion of support to 5.5 million refugees and their host communities since 2012.",3
The increase has also boosted our support to the UN’s regional response and to the neighbouring countries that are hosting many of those refugees.,3
"We have issued more than 39,000 visas under the refugee family reunion rules, around half of which were to children In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and a number of other noble Lords, the Government’s Afghan citizens resettlement scheme will provide up to 20,000 vulnerable people with a safe and legal route to resettle in the UK.",3
"Under Operation Warm Welcome, we are helping Afghans arriving in the UK to rebuild their lives, find work, pursue education and integrate within their new local communities.",3
"Addressing the triggers—from conflict to climate change, and from poverty to abuse of human rights—is a key strand of our integrated review, which sets out our plans to address these challenges over the next 10 years.",3
"For example, we implement UN sanctions against individuals involved in human trafficking and human rights abuses against migrants in Libya Sexual violence is another recurrent cause of displacement.",3
"The othering and scapegoating of marginalised groups is an everyday reality that has been perpetuated by parts of our media and, I am sad to say, by some politicians, whether that relates to refugees, immigrants or Muslims.",2
"The Army of Republika Srpska successfully co-opted civic society through a careful and systematic process of dehumanising Bosnian Muslims so that the agents of death and their collaborators found common and easier cause in achieving their goal of ethnic cleansing Perhaps the Minister can update the House today and set out his views on Serbian succession and what steps the Government are taking to ensure that Bosnian Serbs are not rewarded, in their goal of creating a “Greater Serbia”, by being handed the very territory in which they committed a four-year campaign consisting of forced deportations, torture and mass murder.",3
"On Monday this week, as the Home Affairs Committee report, “Channel crossings, migration and asylum”, was published, the number of people who had made the dangerous journey across the English channel from France to the United Kingdom rose above 15,000 this year.",3
"Last year the figure was 28,500, and this year the Home Office predictions suggest that as many as 60,000 people could arrive on our shores on makeshift, leaky dinghies hardly worthy of the name of “boat”, wearing lifejackets more likely to drown them than save them In Dover recently, members of my Committee and I saw the arrival of two such vessels crowded mainly with men, but also with women and small children on board these potential death traps.",3
"Witnesses we spoke to talked of making two, three or four failed journeys from the French coast, turned back by leaking boats or wind and waves, before finally reaching the British coast or being escorted to safety by British vessels, including the Navy and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.",3
The UK spends £1.5 billion a year on its asylum system.,3
We house asylum seekers and refugees in hotels at a cost of nearly £5 million a day.,3
"We agree with the Home Secretary that the asylum system is broken and unsustainable, but we do not agree that it was those who sought safety by crossing the channel who broke the system The Home Office urgently needs to reduce the asylum backlog.",3
"The number of people coming to the UK each year is relatively stable—around 48,000 last year—but the time taken to grant asylum or make another determination has steadily risen.",3
"The most cost-effective way to cut the cost would be to have fewer people in the asylum system, and the most effective way to do that is to get people out of it more quickly through faster decision making; 449 days for the average decision is far too long.",3
No child should wait 550 days—the average time taken—to find out what their future is in the foreign country they have come to International co-operation is also needed to tackle what is a worldwide problem.,3
"One of the Committee’s key recommendations is to seek a deal with France to process asylum claims to the UK on French soil in reception centres, possibly on a pilot basis, and with a guarantee that those not granted asylum here would remain in France.",3
"We already have juxtaposed passport control, so the French are at Dover and the UK authorities at Calais, so such an arrangement does have a precedent, but we accept that it is politically contentious.",4
"The Home Secretary has, in the past, suggested that such a plan might draw more migrants to France in search of asylum in the UK.",3
"It could prevent people from feeling the need to cross the channel unsafely in unseaworthy boats, and it could save lives The Committee also recommends seeking closer co-operation with the EU.",3
The Minister told us that only five people who had crossed in small boats last year between January and November were returned.,3
"The Government’s hope of bilateral deals with individual EU countries has clearly not been realised Clearly, provision of safe and legal routes for refugees, a realistic recognition that the UK is neither the least nor the most generous host in Europe or in the wider world, and a willingness to co-operate fully with our nearest neighbours by sharing intelligence and equipment to identify and undermine people smuggling criminal organisations may not offer the eye-catching headlines, but they are most likely to work I wish to say something about unaccompanied children.",3
"We recommend that the Government confirm urgently who is responsible for safeguarding these children and tell us what they are doing to prevent children, alone and potentially vulnerable, simply vanishing from sight into unknown hands and unknown futures We also make recommendations about the need to review the experience and the process that children go through when claiming asylum.",3
"Last week, according to figures very helpfully published on the Ministry of Defence website, a total of 1,474 people in 39 boats came to the United Kingdom, and the trend is up over the past three weeks.",3
"Over 88,000 British national (overseas) status holders and their family members have chosen to apply for the BNO route, with over 76,000 granted so far Some 15,000 people were airlifted out of Afghanistan to the UK from mid-August under Operation Pitting, over and above the earlier transfers of around 2,000 locally employed staff and their families under the Afghan relocations and assistance policy.",3
"First, providing sanctuary and refuge is not inconsistent with a fair asylum and immigration system; such humanitarian measures are possible only if we have a fair asylum and immigration system, capable of providing both welcome and integration.",3
"Secondly, an approach to immigration which refuses admission to anyone under any circumstances is obviously inhumane.",2
"But some things have not changed: the British public remain generous and kind and there is no question about that However, that generosity and kindness does not mean that they are willing to accept uncontrolled immigration—and nor should we expect them to.",3
The truth is that we cannot hope to properly control our borders unless we address illegal entry.,2
"That requires comprehensive reform of the asylum system and this Bill is fundamental to delivering the change that is so badly needed Some people—and I respect their honesty, although I think they are profoundly misguided—are opposed to any form of immigration control whatever.",3
"But for everyone else, who recognises that we have to control our borders, we must also recognise the reality that this means addressing, tackling and reducing illegal entry Too many people profess a desire to control our borders but then, when it comes to putting that professed desire into practice, oppose any and every measure designed to do so.",3
"So I look forward to contributions to this debate which, if they disagree with the Government’s proposals, set out precisely what steps should be taken to achieve the objective of controlled immigration that many profess to support When we talk about illegal entry, the illegality does not begin—and certainly does not end—with the migrants themselves, who have often been exploited by criminal gangs.",3
"These days, illegal entry is a business.",3
"In the year to March 2021, the UK received more than 33,000 asylum applications, which is more than at the height of the European migration crisis in 2015-16.",3
"At the end of June last year, there were more than 120,000 cases categorised as “works in progress” in the asylum system, including cases awaiting appeal decisions and some 40,000 failed asylum seekers who are subject to removal from the UK but have not yet left or been removed.",3
"This includes foreign national offenders who have been found guilty of serious crimes such as murder, rape and child sex offences.",3
The asylum system now costs more than £1 billion a year to run.,2
"Inaction is simply not a responsible option This Bill has three key objectives: first, to increase both the fairness and the efficiency of our system; secondly, to deter illegal entry to the UK; and, thirdly, to remove more easily from the UK those with no right to be here.",3
"I shall speak to each of these objectives in turn First, it is high time we took action to make our immigration and asylum system fairer and more efficient.",3
An inefficient immigration and asylum system is fair to nobody.,2
"So we will introduce a new form of temporary permission to stay in the UK for those who do not come directly to the UK or claim asylum without delay once here, but who have none the less been recognised as requiring protection.",3
"This status will afford only basic entitlements, while still meeting our international treaty obligations We will establish accommodation centres for both asylum seekers and failed asylum seekers who require support, so that they have simple, safe and secure accommodation to stay in while their claims and returns are processed A new and expanded one-stop process will ensure that asylum and any other protection matters are made and considered together, ahead of any appeal hearing.",3
"We will also reform nationality law to make it fairer and to address some historic anomalies Secondly, as well as making the system fairer and more efficient, we need to send a message that illegal entry will not be tolerated.",3
The maximum penalty for entering the country illegally will rise from six months to four years in prison.,3
We are also providing Border Force with additional powers: to stop and divert vessels suspected of carrying illegal migrants to the UK and return them to where their sea journey to the UK began; to search unaccompanied containers located within ports for the presence of illegal migrants using them to enter the UK; and to seize and dispose of vessels that are intercepted.,3
"Drivers will face a fine for every illegal entrant concealed in their vehicle, regardless of the steps that they have taken to secure that vehicle.",3
"We will make it possible to remove someone to a safe third country, where their asylum claim will be processed Thirdly, failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals cannot be allowed to stay here indefinitely.",3
It would also undermine confidence in our immigration system.,2
"So the Bill contains a number of measures designed to strengthen our ability to do that We will confirm that the UK may remove people, including foreign criminals, to a safe third country.",3
"Expedited processes will enable the rapid removal of those with no right to be here, while visa penalties could be imposed on countries that do not co-operate on removals.",3
We will also ensure that failure to comply with the asylum or removal process without good reason must be considered in deciding whether to grant immigration bail.,3
"We will widen the window in which foreign national offenders can be removed from prison under the early removal scheme for the purposes of removal from the UK We will also make a change to the long-standing power—and it is of long standing—to deprive someone of British citizenship in the most serious incidences of terrorism, war crimes or fraud to ensure that the power can still be used when, because of exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to notify the person of that decision.",3
"We remain fully committed to our international treaty and other obligations, including the refugee convention, the European Convention on Human Rights and international maritime law The principle behind this Bill and the New Plan for Immigration is simple.",3
"Access to the UK’s asylum system should be based on need, not on the ability to pay people smugglers, and no one should be able to jump the queue and place themselves in front of people who really need our help.",3
I need no persuasion as to the importance of asylum or the benefits of immigration.,2
Providing sanctuary and refuge are not only not inconsistent with a fair asylum and immigration system; they are only possible under a fair asylum and immigration system.,2
"My Lords, one of this Government’s favourite slogans has just been repeated, that our asylum system is broken, followed by a claim that a Johnson Government will fix it.",3
"Two years ago, the Home Secretary said that her then plan would halve the number of boats crossing the channel in three months and make them infrequent in six months.",3
"In response, the Home Secretary and the Government have introduced this Bill, which contains no new safe and legal routes, nothing to target ruthless criminal gangs and smugglers, and a number of empty and unworkable solutions If we want to know why the asylum system is broken, we need look no further than this Government and the Home Office.",3
The number of initial asylum decisions being made by the Home Office each year has dropped by more than 40% over the last five years.,3
"Some 67,000—some say it is even more—are still waiting for an initial decision on their asylum claim.",3
Reducing levels of support will do nothing to prevent people having to leave their home to seek asylum This Government continue to be a Government of slogans.,3
The Government say that they are motivated by a desire to crack down on the criminal smuggler gangs but then produce a Bill with measures directed at the victims of those smugglers rather than at the gangs themselves.,3
"Despite promising safe legal routes as an alternative to dangerous journeys, the Government have cut safe legal routes for family reunion, refugees and asylum seekers in Europe, and have included no safe legal routes in this Bill The Government claim that the Bill will stop boats arriving and return people who travel in them.",3
"France has refused to agree to receive boats safely back, and so these pushbacks simply cannot happen in practice The Government claim that the Bill will mean offshore processing, even though no country has agreed and the cost to the taxpayer would be huge.",3
"The Government claim the Bill will fix the asylum system, even though it will add even longer delays to asylum cases being assessed The Government claim the Bill will stop trafficking gangs, even though they are cutting protection for modern slavery.",3
"In pursuit of the Government’s stated aim of preventing people using a defence of being a victim of modern slavery against deportation, the Bill removes a number of key protections for victims of human trafficking and modern slavery, rowing back on crucial protections created under the Modern Slavery Act 2015.",3
"She said that watering down protection for modern slavery victims, including UK-resident children caught up in criminal exploitation and county lines, will “severely limit our ability to convict perpetrators and dismantle organised crime groups.” Mistakes are often made when people are ruled not to be victims of human trafficking or modern slavery.",3
The Home Office’s own data shows that four out of five rejected human trafficking claims challenged in the UK last year were overturned.,3
"Despite that, the Bill does not provide safeguards for children, does not recognise that children need different provisions and protections from adults, and does not make policy that acts in the best interests of the child Since 2014 the Government have spent more than £200 million on numerous deals with French authorities—equal to around half a million pounds per week of taxpayers’ money—yet the crossings are increasing as the Government proclaim that Brexit has given us control of our borders.",3
"What we do know though, is that the Government’s various deals with the French did not prevent the tragic loss of 27 lives when an inflatable dinghy capsized some six weeks ago, in late November last year We need new agreements on joint policing and asylum with France and other EU countries to prevent more of these deadly crossings, and covering all aspects of security co-operation, including exchange of information on tackling criminal smuggler gangs and facilitating safe legal routes and safe returns If this Government are serious about cracking down on the criminal smuggler gangs that profit from putting desperate people in flimsy dinghies, neither can they ignore the ways that these gangs lure in vulnerable people online.",3
"However, the Bill still appears to break international maritime law and the duty for a ship to attempt to rescue persons in danger at sea by requiring passing boats or vessels to ignore people in distress or face criminalisation The Bill criminalises someone arriving in the UK to claim asylum, changes the immigration offence of how someone enters the UK and specifies the mode of entry as either legal or illegal.",3
"The Bill also makes provision for differential treatment of refugees based on how they arrive into the UK and the point at which they present themselves to the authorities, with those who travel via a third country, do not have documents or do not claim asylum immediately being designated “group 2” refugees.",3
"Yet the refugee convention contains a single unitary definition of refugee, solely related according to their need for protection The Red Cross has said that this differentiated treatment will not deter dangerous journeys.",3
"It points out that, even where people have a choice in their mode of travel, it is rare for a person fleeing to have any idea of their rights or the complexities of the asylum law where they arrive.",3
The Red Cross suggests that removing family reunion rights will increase the number of particularly women and children using illegal routes and will actually shore up the business model of the criminal gangs and smugglers The Bill enables the prosecution of individuals intercepted in UK territorial seas and brought into this country who arrive in but do not technically “enter” the UK.,3
The new offence will carry a maximum sentence of four years There is no visa or entry clearance application for someone to make to come to the UK to claim asylum.,3
"Under this Bill, someone with a well-founded fear of persecution arriving in the UK intending to claim asylum will be committing a criminal offence.",3
"Article 31 of the refugee convention provides that states “shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees … where their life or freedom was threatened … they present themselves without delay … and … show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.” The courts have recognised that it would be hollow if asylum seekers could not rely on this international law protection.",3
"If all countries were to take this approach of criminalising those who enter illegally for the purposes of claiming asylum, the entire international system for refugee protection would fall apart When we left the European Union, we also left the schemes which gave the UK the ability to return those seeking asylum to safe countries via the Dublin III system.",3
This allowed those seeking asylum who entered the UK to be returned if they had first registered in another country in the European Union.,3
"Under the Dublin III regulation, the UK safely returned hundreds of asylum seekers to European countries.",3
"Since the Dublin regulation stopped applying to the UK at the beginning of last year, the UK has returned, as I said, just five asylum seekers to European countries, at a time when channel crossings have significantly increased The Bill provides for asylum seekers to be removed from the UK while their claims are being processed, opening the door to offshore processing.",3
"Offshore processing in Australia cost an estimated 1 billion Australian dollars a year to deal with 300 migrants Last year, some 28,500 people made the dangerous channel crossing.",3
Research by the Refugee Council suggests that around two-thirds who crossed the channel via small boats and claimed asylum were granted humanitarian protection.,3
"Over 70% of people arriving via small boats come from just five countries, namely Iran, Sudan, Syria, Iraq and Vietnam, and Afghanistan was seventh, behind Eritrea—hardly countries free from strife and persecution.",3
Neither has the number of asylum applications suddenly reached an all-time peak.,3
"In 2020 there were around six asylum applications for every 10,000 people living in the UK.",3
"Across the EU, there were 11 asylum applications for every 10,000 people.",3
"Compared with EU 27 countries, the UK ranks 17th for asylum applications per head of population I know that much reference will be made today to Clause 9, which was added in haste and without proper scrutiny in the Commons.",3
Powers to deprive someone of British citizenship have existed since 1914.,4
"This Bill, though, also gives the Home Office sweeping new powers to deprive a person of their British citizenship without any notice.",3
"In the shadow of Windrush, warm words from the Government about how fairly and responsibly they will use the power just will not suffice Children, including unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, can make up almost 25% of those seeking asylum in the UK.",3
"Where is the provision for a safe resettlement scheme for Afghanistan, which has been promised but not yet delivered The Bill will not solve the problem of dangerous boat crossings that are putting lives at risk.",3
"Instead, it will increase the asylum backlog, keeping more people in limbo in accommodation.",3
"The Bill will not stop trafficking gangs, as the Government are cutting protection from modern slavery and thus making it harder to prosecute and convict people traffickers At heart, the Bill is about a Government and a Home Secretary who know that their policies to date are failing and who, in a bid to attract more favourable headlines, are concentrating their fire even more on the victims of people traffickers and deadly channel crossings, rather than setting out sensible plans to deal with the criminal gangs involved based on co-operation, not insularity.",3
"It is understandable that immigration is a cause for concern for many people, particularly with the misleading information published by the Government and echoed by the media The UK is home to approximately 68 million people.",3
"Based on the most recent figures, net immigration is about 300,000 a year, or 0.4% of the existing population, of which claims for asylum in 2019 were 36,000, or just one application for every 2,000 people in the UK.",3
"Net migration is at a low level per head of population, and only a fraction of those coming here to live are asylum seekers.",3
"As the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, said, 84,132 people sought asylum in the UK in 2002.",3
"In 2019 it was 35,737, less than half than it was 17 years earlier There are more common misconceptions, such as that there is a danger of immigrants taking British people’s jobs.",3
Another misconception is that there are too many immigrants in the UK.,2
"London has the highest concentration of immigrants in the UK, over a third of the total, and Londoners are the least concerned about immigration Another misconception is that there are record numbers of migrants crossing the channel.",3
"No, there are record numbers of migrants crossing the channel in small boats, because the UK has been effective in stopping channel crossings by most other means—for example, stowing away in lorries or on trains.",3
"Also, no safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to get to the UK are currently in operation, and you can only claim asylum on UK soil, so what are they supposed to do?",3
Numbers were significantly lower last year because of Covid lockdowns and they are significantly higher this year because of the resulting pent-up demand We are not being overwhelmed by asylum seekers.,3
"We have fewer applications for asylum per head of population than almost every other European country, as the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, has said.",3
"With the UK’s claim rate being almost half the EU’s, what prospect does the Minister think we have of persuading EU countries to take back migrants in the absence of the previous agreement, the Dublin III regulations, which obliged EU states to do so So, what is the problem—or should I say, what are the problems?",3
"The evidence points to the Home Office being ineffective and inefficient in dealing with asylum applications, not that there is a problem with the legislation.",3
"Twenty years ago, the UK had more than double the number of applications for asylum but less than half the number of cases awaiting a decision.",3
"Covid may have impacted the Home Office’s ability to process claims, but the number of asylum seekers fell greatly at the same time for the same reason The Government say there are record waits for asylum application appeals, but those delays are nothing compared to the delays in criminal trials at Crown Courts.",3
The Government’s proposed solution is to reduce the number of asylum cases to speed up the process.,3
So why does this Bill propose to cut the numbers able to claim asylum and to introduce fast-track systems that place limits on legal advice and the time taken to present evidence?,3
"If it was possible to remove almost double the number of illegal immigrants from the UK using existing legislation in 2013, surely the problem is not with the legislation but with the Home Office.",3
"Can the Minister explain to the House what the various contributing factors are, and what impact each of these has on the ability of the Home Office to remove people As the Minister has said, there are 10,000 foreign national offenders in the community together with 42,000 failed asylum seekers, all of whom should not be in the UK.",3
"The National Audit Office estimates that there are between 600,000 and 1.2 million illegal immigrants in the UK.",3
"The hostile environment that tries to turn landlords, employers and bankers into Immigration Enforcement officers, is clearly not working Instead of “taking back control” of our borders, those arriving from 10 more countries can now use the ePassport gates at the UK border—in addition to all EU countries, which can continue to use them—whereas before they had to prove they were coming to the UK for a legitimate reason, had somewhere to live and had enough money to fund their stay.",3
"This has been replaced by a points-based system with no limit on the number of the “brightest and the best”—as the Government like to call them—foreign nationals being employed in the UK When the Government say that they want a “high-skill, high-wage economy”, what they do not tell people is that there are no longer any limits on how many foreign nationals can take those “high-skill, high-wage” jobs; the only opportunities reserved for UK nationals are in low-skill, low-wage jobs The epitome of this Bill, which addresses all the wrong issues while doing nothing to address the right issues and to solve the real problems of the immigration system, is the tightening of the rules around modern slavery, where conclusive grounds of modern slavery are established in almost 90% of cases Other noble Lords will take issue with keeping asylum seekers in camps; preventing their integration into society; not allowing them to work; preventing them from making a positive contribution to society; treating those with a valid asylum claim as illegitimate; and depriving British nationals of their citizenship without even notifying them.",3
"If ever a Bill deserved not to be given a Second Reading, this is it—which is saying something as we still wrestle with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill We on these Benches accept that there needs to be grip and focus on illegal immigration, but this Bill is a distraction, and a very dangerous one.",3
"The Times of 11 September 2021 concluded that “America’s wars helped to radicalise a generation of Islamists, whose poisonous ideology has spread across the Middle East to Africa, from where new terrorist franchises plot fresh attacks on the West.” The Economist of 20 November reported on how “jihadists aligned to al-Qaeda and Islamic State” in the Sahel “have taken aim at Western countries, bombing their embassies and kidnapping or killing their citizens.” It concluded: “If the jihadists are given havens and time, they will surely launch attacks on European or American soil, too.” The UK has already given haven to jihadists who have been involved in several attacks, the most recent being the Liverpool bomber, who went as far as masking himself as a Christian in an attempt to obtain asylum So, however much we may wish to, and should, give hospitality to many of those who seek to come here—whether as refugees, asylum seekers or, indeed, migrants —we must be far more vigilant in the screening process.",3
"The unmet challenge of screening 28,000 people who arrived in England by small boats during 2021 must not recur in 2022 I was puzzled when my noble friend Lady Williams— I thank her for that useful letter today—said in a Written Answer on 16 December that identity checks, including fingerprints and other biometrics, taken from migrants on arrival cannot be compared against the EU system which the UK has access to because “use of those systems is only permitted for law enforcement, not immigration purposes.” I can think of few more obvious law enforcement purposes than the detection of possible terrorists.",3
"I hope my noble friend will be able to assure us that the Bill will be changed to overrule that absurdity Secondly, on the responsibility of maintaining and enhancing our domestic living standards, there are now, as we have heard, several million individuals who need or would like to live in the UK; the great majority are economic migrants.",3
"The political constraint on any moral imperative to share these scarce resources with migrants is the consequent reduction in the standards available in the UK, and it is set by what the population—which in a democracy means the electorate—will accept.",3
"We are already making special provision for economic migrants who can fill crucial shortages in the supply of certain skills; for example, in the medical and care sectors.",3
I have been here 20 years ago—as has been mentioned several times—in examining overseas processing.,3
I have been here in reducing unwarranted asylum by two-thirds by the time I left the Home Office It is really important to understand what has happened previously and to learn from it.,3
A two-tier asylum system will fail.,2
Withdrawal of citizenship without notification or explanation will be immoral.,2
"Please, if we are going to preach morality, let us at least be honest about it In the time I have, I want to ask the Minister to clarify, via her officials in the Box, whether—seeing as we are talking about morality and the intentions of this Bill—the Home Secretary said, as was reported extensively on 17 November from her visit to Washington, when speaking to journalists about migrants: “These people have come to our country and abused British values, abused the values of the fabric of our country and our society.",3
"The consul’s words are: “‘If you’ve got no passport, you’re officially dead’” and the answer from the migrant is: “But we are still alive, my dear, but we are still alive.” Today, he might have written that the manifest demanded it, the border official commanded it, but in the refugee camp they removed it—my identity, my sanctuary, my everything Removing the right to come here unless you have a passport and visa is fraudulent.",3
"It creates a two-tier system which says that if you get here legally and have the right to be here, we will deny you asylum, because of course you do not warrant it.",3
"However, if you do not have the documentation and arrive here illegally, we will imprison you for four years.",3
"My Lords, I value the valuable contribution made by the noble Lord, Lord Blunkett, particularly his time as Home Secretary in a previous Government Between 1949 and to date, nationality, immigration and asylum laws in the United Kingdom have come full circle, from complete freedom for all British subjects to enter and live in this country to a strict limitation of that right to British citizens and a small number of people with a residual claim arising from past commitments.",3
"One main reason for this is that despite a series of reports from the House of Commons Select Committees and other authoritative sources, it is still not widely known that large-scale immigration to the United Kingdom is a thing of the past.",3
"We have seen prominent politicians dealing positively with it in areas where migrants have settled, only to find the same politicians adopting a different stance in areas of predominantly white settlement.",3
"Such double talk does more damage to good race relations in the country A little while ago, writing in the Guardian, Jonathan Freedland noted “a kind of drumbeat of hysteria in which both politicians and media have turned again and again on a … small minority, first prodding them, then pounding them as if they represented the single biggest problem in national life.” This is a difficult time to have a calm and reasoned discussion about migrants, which political leaders claim to want Let us look at the figures that were bandied about during the Brexit referendum— stirring up emotions at this crucial time was a good way to make political gains.",3
We hear about the harshness surrounding migrants entering the country through the English Channel.,3
We blame France for its inability to control the flow of migrants to UK Every piece of legislation since 1962 indicates that there is no such thing as total protection of our borders.,3
We must find a different way for migrants to apply for asylum.,2
"As early as then, the Government set up an interdepartmental committee to consider legislative and administrative methods to deal with migrants.",3
So preoccupied were Ministers in the 1950s with the numbers entering the UK that the welfare and integration of newcomers was not even discussed.,3
"We are now proceeding with harsher issues which will have substantial impact on those who wish to settle in this country Following the correspondence with my noble friend Lady Hamwee, I have studied the response from Victoria Atkins MP on Afghan refugees.",3
"My Lords, I cannot discuss matters of nationality and borders without confessing that this is extremely personal territory for me, as I know it is for others in your Lordships’ House.",4
It is personal territory because I am the daughter of migrants to this country—hard-working people no longer with me and yet with me always.,3
"They came, as so many like them did, at the invitation of the late first Earl of Stockton when he was Prime Minister In my working life as a human rights lawyer, first in the home department and subsequently outside it, I have seen time and again the manner in which Governments and politicians of all stripes have eroded the hard-won rights of refugees in particular, and how dog-whistle politics around immigration has toxified race relations and undermined race equality, even to the detriment of British people whose migration stories go multiple generations back.",3
So these are issues as much of equality and common decency as of nationality and borders The Bill has a patriotic title.,3
The use of the word “borders” is surprisingly colourful for parliamentary counsel: it could have been taken directly from a campaigning slogan.,3
"I have no objection to nationality or borders, but I must observe that neither Covid nor climate catastrophe respects either very much.",2
A truly global Britain would cherish the refugee convention as a central pillar of the post-war international settlement once promoted by Britain and would not seek to dilute it.,3
"The Dunkirk spirit is about saving people in little boats, not turning them around.",3
"No wonder this provision has inspired fear and loathing in our minority communities in particular Even the subject heading of Clause 11 sends a chill to the bones, with its “Differential treatment of refugees”.",3
"To penalise and even criminalise desperate people in any way for the manner in which they make their escape from persecution to the UK is to violate the letter and the spirit of the refugee convention, which was in no small part the world’s apology for some of the darkest moments in the history of the last century.",3
"The Bill attempts to redefine Article 31, thereby ripping up years of interpretation by specialist judges so as to grant only second-class protection to the majority of refugees These are but two of the myriad objections to this measure.",3
"I have never known any other subject on which that could have been said When the Home Secretary said that the asylum system was broken, I confess that I felt a frisson of déjà vu.",3
"I was waiting for somebody to suggest St Helena or Elba, which have been used in the past against intransigent foreigners such as Napoleon.",3
"War, persecution, famine and climate change, which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Desai, and others, have driven unprecedented numbers of refugees around the world, probably about 80 million.",3
We have internationalised travel: the EU’s external borders are porous and the EU’s determination to provide limitless internal travel throughout Europe through the Schengen process offers ample opportunities for anyone coming in from their external borders I will make this point.,4
"We are talking about refugees fleeing their bombed-out homes or fields that cannot support crops anymore because of climate change, and people seeking asylum from oppressive governments—human beings who have been enslaved by callous criminals.",2
"At a time when the world feels more dangerous than ever, and while the UK continues to fuel global conflict by acting as one of the world’s largest arms dealers, history will judge our Parliament and our Government harshly for this legislation The Government speak warm words about making things safer for refugees and asylum seekers, but the Bill offers no solutions for genuine safe passage.",3
It is appeasement to right-wing extremists and a continuation of the Conservative Party’s decades-long obsession with immigration.,3
"At the moment, the UK birth rate is about 1.5 children per woman, and we need 2.8 children per woman for replacement, so we need immigrants; we are an ageing and falling population There is also the problem that I do not think this legislation will work.",3
"Creating a two-tier system for refugees, divided on how they arrived in the UK, is unlikely to make any difference.",3
"The UNHCR has stated in no uncertain terms that this is discriminatory and in violation of the 1951 Refugee Convention There is the undermining of access to justice, fiddling with legal process, and curtailing rights to appeal, all of which significantly increase the risks of deporting people with valid claims, putting them at risk of further enslavement, torture or death.",3
"It is unclear how, under Clause 39, asylum seekers are supposed to enter the UK legally and without committing a criminal offence.",3
"Some 90% of people granted asylum in the UK are from countries whose nationals must obtain an entry clearance visa to enter the UK Turning to the deprivation of citizenship provisions in Clause 9, a lot of people will be surprised to learn that the Government already can—and do—remove people’s right to British citizenship.",3
"That is not new, but it means there is a two-tier system of British citizenship.",3
The change is that the Government will now be able to remove people’s citizenship without any notice or warning whatever.,3
"Of course, because citizenship will have been revoked without any notice, any judicial review or other legal challenge will only be able to be brought retrospectively In summary, the Bill is a continuation of the trend by this Government to remove individuals’ rights, undermine legal safeguards and view the legal profession as the enemy within.",3
"The end result is that injustices will go unresolved, genuine claims for asylum will be denied, and a great many people will be condemned to misery and suffering who ought to have been allowed to start life afresh on these islands.",3
"In words that might resonate with the Benches opposite, this Bill is a stain on British values As somebody who comes from Celtic stock—my lineage was here after the previous ice age—I welcome immigrants; I feel that they add life and vitality to what is sometimes a rather dull population.",3
"The Bill has many aspects that I would wish to comment on in the time allowed, but I will confine myself to what has led to the need for this legislation—the issues created by unscrupulous organised gangs of criminals who prey on vulnerable people of all ages by illegally facilitating their entry into the UK by crossing the channel from France to England.",3
"Of that there is no doubt at all, but, of course, this brings me to the heart of the matter The question arises as to why these migrants, having arrived in a safe country within the European Union, put all at risk in order to cross one of the busiest shipping channels in the world, having paid what is usually an extortionate sum of money to travel in what amounts in many cases to no more than a rubber dinghy with paddles.",3
"Maybe French hospitality is not quite what it is made out to be, but it is clear that these migrants would not be able to make their voyages across the channel without organised criminals facilitating their passage.",3
"The Bill seeks to address the issue of refugees arriving illegally, distinguishing between those who arrive directly from a country or territory where their life or freedom was threatened and those who do not My real concern—I take the opportunity of Second Reading to express it—lies with the marked lack of effectiveness of those tasked with combating cross-channel illegal immigration.",3
"From previous experience, I am more than aware that knowledge is power, and, as a consequence, organisations, including law enforcement, are often drawn into intelligence silos As it stands at the moment, from what I am given to understand there is every reason to believe that this is the case in relation to the agencies tasked with countering cross-channel illegal immigration.",3
"After all is said and done, that should be the goal in order to prevent some of the most horrible drownings that we have witnessed in recent times I can see that the Bill is a step forward, a brave attempt indeed, in the battle to deter immigrants from entering illegally by streamlining what in reality amounts to a very difficult process.",3
We were given to understand that in this new role Mr O’Mahoney would be leading the UK’s response to tackling illegal attempts to reach the UK.,3
He would have the primary responsibility for making the channel route unviable for small boat crossings.,3
"He would collaborate closely with the French to build on the joint work already under way, urgently exploring tougher action in France, including stronger enforcement measures, adopting interceptions at sea and the direct return of boats.",3
It is now reported that the number of people who crossed the English Channel in small boats last year was treble the number in 2020.,3
"According to the BBC, it shows that at least 28,431 migrants made the journey in 2021, despite huge UK hard-earned taxpayer contributions being invested in France to prevent crossings Last November, just over 1,000 people reached British shores aboard 33 boats.",3
"I strongly maintain that until there is proper intelligence co-ordination, particularly with the French—where that is possible, post Brexit—no amount of legislation will solve the illegal immigration problem in respect of the channel crossings, in my humble opinion To conclude, the fact remains that, as vigorous as the Bill is in dealing with those who have arrived illegally in the UK, the primary objective of any law enforcement agency must be the prevention of crime at whatever level.",3
"My Lords, the hallmarks of this Bill are illegality and inhumanity; the imposition of still greater inefficiency and expense on our asylum system; and prejudice to the interests of society in having well-integrated refugees The Bill delivers neither dignity for asylum seekers nor a fair deal for taxpayers.",3
"My colleague in the other place, Alistair Carmichael, said: “If cruelty and bureaucracy were the answer, the Home Office would have solved the problem long ago.” The Bill represents, in the words of distinguished lawyers led by Raza Husain QC, “the biggest legal assault on international refugee law ever seen in the UK.” We have a system that is already working badly.",3
"The numbers the UK receives ought to be manageable: most European countries, including France, receive far more refugees per head of population than we do The obvious solution is to frontload the system, including investing in retention of caseworkers; improving the quality and accuracy of first-instance decision-making; restoring legal aid; and properly funding the courts and tribunals.",3
They will then double down on blaming asylum seekers rather than looking at the mote in their own eye—I am not the first to observe that it is the Home Office which is broken—and the whole sorry cycle will continue There is little in the Bill which helps to put the people-smuggling gangs out of business.,3
"The only real way is to create sufficient safe and legal routes, whether through resettlement, humanitarian visas, allowing claims to be lodged at a UK embassy or from, for instance, France, or family reunion.",4
Can the Minister tell us what assessment her department has made of the impact the Bill will have on the number of family reunion visas granted each year The UNHCR makes the entirely valid point that the Government’s aim of forcing people to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach is by necessity absent from the refugee convention.,3
"The front-line states, which already accommodate nearly 75% of the world’s refugees, would never have signed a convention committing them to host 100% I second what the Conservative MP Caroline Nokes said on Report about penalising so-called group 2 refugees: “It causes me real concern that we will create a two-tier system in which people with identical claims to safety—at identical risk from the Taliban—are treated very differently.”—[Official Report, Commons, 7/12/21; col.",3
The further marginalisation of asylum seekers is not only cruel but thoroughly misguided.,2
"Skills are lost and health harmed; they are left open to exploitation, with integration and naturalisation impeded and postponed.",3
"This is contrary to every interest of our society, which is to see refugees become contributing, productive and taxpaying citizens as soon as possible.",2
"I also have time only to flag my concerns about the proposals on age assessments Although the provisions of Clauses 1 to 8 on citizenship are largely welcome, there are two specific groups whose problems in acquiring British citizenship I want to flag: Chagos Islanders and some EU citizens.",3
"Lady Lister, if she so acts, in an amendment on the lines of that tabled in the other place by Henry Smith to restore the citizenship rights of the Chagossians and their descendants, who lost both their homeland and nationality rights when cruelly evicted 65 years ago.",3
"It is encouraging that the Minister, Tom Pursglove, indicated that he was “sympathetic” to its aims I will again be vigorously pursuing the obscure and obsolete legacy of comprehensive sickness insurance, this time because it is unjustly tripping up EU citizens as regards their own or their children’s British citizenship or family reunion rights Lastly, as well as Clause 10 on stateless children, Clause 9 is understandably causing great alarm among our compatriots who because of descent or marriage could be at risk of statelessness.",3
"My Lords, we are an island race and have been subject to many waves of immigration and invasion—some welcome, some not.",3
I say the above to demonstrate my support for economic immigration.,3
"Indeed, in the New Plan for Immigration published in March 2021, the Government described the UK’s in-country asylum case load as being at an “unsustainable” level.",3
"It stated that 109,000 asylum cases were in the system; of those, 52,000 were still awaiting a decision at the end of 2020.",3
"In 2020-21, it is costing the taxpayer just under £1.4 billion The number of decisions made per year has been falling, despite an increase in asylum casework staff.",3
Compare that to the 20% rate in France—no wonder immigrants do not bother stopping in Paris but head straight for Calais.,3
"Indeed, many applications for asylum in the UK come from people who have had their applications in other European countries turned down.",3
"But no one arriving in small boats is fleeing persecution in France A related problem highlighted by the Home Secretary is that the persistent failure to enforce our immigration laws, as reflected by the woeful removal statistics—I believe it was only about 2,500 last year—is eroding public trust and disadvantaging vulnerable people who need our help.",3
"According to Migration Watch, 79% of British voters think that the Government are handling immigration poorly.",3
It is high time we dealt more robustly with people trying to access our country illegally.,2
"My Lords, I welcome the long overdue ending of the injustice done to those deprived of the right to citizenship because their British Overseas Territory father was not married to their mother.",3
"Sadly, this positive citizenship step is overshadowed by making it harder for stateless children to acquire British nationality, the last-minute introduction of the power to remove citizenship without notice and the very disappointing response in the Commons to attempts to remedy the gross injustice done to the Chagossians, evicted permanently from their homeland by the British Government, with their descendants denied citizenship rights.",3
I hope we can rectify that and rectify the long- standing overcharging of children’s citizenship fees I turn to the asylum sections of what has been justifiably dubbed the “anti-refugee Bill”.,3
"Contrary to government claims, the Bill, as we have heard, is, in the words of the UNHCR, “fundamentally at odds with … the United Kingdom’s international obligations under the Refugee Convention” First, through criminalisation; secondly, through the application of inadmissibility rules which, according to the UNHCR, rely on a “fundamental misapplication of … the Refugee Convention”, in particular a non-existent “first safe country” principle; and thirdly, by the creation of two refugee classes, the Bill effectively denies most asylum seekers the rights afforded by the convention.",3
"Moreover, through the prospect of offshoring, discredited by Australian experience, it strips them of their dignity and humanity The temporary protection status that awaits “group 2” refugees is likely to mean the kind of barracks-style accommodation found to be dehumanising and injurious to mental health by an APPG on Immigration Detention inquiry, of which I was a member, together with a significant increase in the numbers with no recourse to public funds, spelling serious hardship, including for children.",3
"Moreover, far from expanding such routes—for instance, through humanitarian visas—the Bill’s weakening of family reunion rights will reduce them One consequence, the UNHCR warns, will be that more women and children are likely to attempt dangerous journeys.",3
"How is it, then, that Women for Refugee Women and more than 50 other organisations have written to the Home Secretary to warn that more women will be wrongly refused asylum, retraumatised and placed at risk of violence and abuse?",3
"Among their concerns are the consequences for women fleeing gender-based violence, more restrictive rules governing asylum interviews and the definition of “particular social group” which women often use to make their case.",3
We have here the institutionalisation of the culture of disbelief that has long marred the asylum process.,2
"First, the Bill, as we have heard, is premised on the assumption that those entering the UK unlawfully, particularly in small boats, are not genuine asylum seekers.",3
"How can the Government make such an a priori assumption, particularly given the Refugee Council’s analysis that shows that most of those crossing the channel are likely to be recognised as being in need of refugee protection?",3
"Secondly, why should we accept the Government’s interpretation of the refugee convention over that of the body with supervisory responsibility for it In conclusion, I cite a refugee who contributed to a Refugee Action consultation following the Government’s failure to take adequate account of refugees’ lived experience in their own consultation.",3
"Much of the population growth has been in less developed countries, where young men—most migrants are young men—despair of their future in their own country and seek a solution in a richer and safer country.",3
"Where there is that demand, you will get ruthless operators who promise young men that they can get them in, hence the flimsy boats crossing the Med and the channel.",3
This is illegal activity that no responsible Government can ignore or condone.,2
"Obviously, most of the migrants go to the poorer parts of the country because that is where the cheaper housing is, and that multiplies the problems of poorer councils in finding accommodation, schools and GP services for the existing population as well as the immigrants.",3
Today the spotlight is on illegal immigration.,2
"As we have all said in the Chamber, we the British people are kind, tolerant and humane, with a good record in dealing with both economic migrants and asylum seekers.",3
"However, illegal immigration on the scale we see today is undoubtedly deeply unpopular.",2
"However much we may sympathise, as fellow human beings, with economic migrants or asylum seekers, our first duty as British parliamentarians is to the people of this country, particularly those living in parts of the country that are having to bear the burden of this phenomenon.",3
"We must listen to the people’s views and develop an immigration policy with which they are comfortable The noble Baroness, Lady Hollins, mentioned Australia, the only country that has been successful in resolving this problem.",3
There was then a huge wave of immigrants and the Labor Government hastily reinstated offshore processing.,3
"They strengthened the policy and, as a result, the 50,000 immigrants a year who were coming in by boat to Australia are now practically zero, and the costs have fallen dramatically.",3
"I have spoken at length to the head of the Australian Border Force, who says that the essential message it got across to potential immigrants was “You will not get into Australia”.",3
"My Lords, I noted that in his opening speech the Minister pledged that the Bill is based on fairness, that illegal activities will not be tolerated, that we aim to deprive people of UK citizenship in the event of the most serious crimes and, above all, that access to the UK should be based on need and not on the ability to pay.",3
"That is why I want to talk about the visa scheme that enables you to buy access to Britain—the golden visa scheme tier 1 investor visas, which allow wealthy people from dodgy countries to buy the right to live in the UK and, after a period of residence, to qualify for citizenship.",3
"It has been reported that more than 6,000 golden visas, half of those yet issued, are being reviewed for possible national security risks, although those who applied in earlier years will by now have acquired full UK citizenship.",3
"In four of the National Crime Agency’s major cases about illicit finance and unexplained wealth orders in the last two years, those under investigation had originally entered the UK with a golden visa Most golden visas have been issued to individuals from countries with a high risk of corruption.",3
"Between 2008 and 2020, a third of all golden visas were issued to individuals from mainland China and 20% to people from Russia.",3
"Between 2008 and 2019, 9% of golden visa applications were refused.",3
"By comparison, 42% of asylum applications were refused.",3
"The UK has regularly been cited in magazines and other sources that appeal to the wealthy as one of the most popular golden visa regimes in the world, and one of the fastest: applications are turned around within three weeks.",3
"For UK asylum applications, the turnaround time is around six months or worse.",3
It is widely recognised that the key to London’s appeal was … the UK’s investor visa scheme” It goes on to say in paragraph 50: “What is now clear is that … it offered ideal mechanisms by which illicit finance could be recycled through what has been referred to as the London ‘laundromat’.,3
"The money was also invested in extending patronage and building influence across a wide sphere of the British establishment … Russian influence in the UK is ‘the new normal’, and there are a lot of Russians with very close links to Putin who are well integrated into the UK business and social scene”— and, as we all know, into UK politics, in effect corrupting aspects of British institutions and politics, extending into Parliament and the Conservative Party.",3
The Intelligence and Security Committee’s report goes on to say that “one key measure” to limit the damage that is being caused “would be an overhaul of the Tier 1 (Investor) visa programme—there needs to be a more robust approach to the approval process for these visas.” I failed to find this touched on when I read through the Bill.,3
I hope the Government will accept that the Bill provides an opportunity to develop a much more robust approach to this rather shameful visa programme.,3
This includes maintaining our borders and dealing with immigration with policies that are firm but fair.,2
"That included rules that were clear and enforced without bias for immigration, including exercising the powers of removal or deportation in cases of illegality or failure under the rules.",3
But I never conflated the issues of immigration and asylum; they are wholly distinct and require different considerations.,3
"It has proposed a number of controversial ideas that we need to examine carefully The first is Clause 28 and Schedule 3, which give the Home Office powers to send asylum applicants to offshore processing centres outside the UK.",3
"About 20 years ago, I chaired two party commissions set up to consider, in turn, the UK’s policies towards asylum and immigration.",3
"One of our asylum proposals was to consider applications in an offshore location, isolated from the mainland.",3
"These new proposals do, and in my opinion would be a clear breach of the principles of the 1951 convention on refugees, as well as providing substantial legal concerns as to the responsibility for dealing with applications.",3
An asylum application is under the control of an applicant.,3
"Until and unless an application is made there is no status of asylum seeker, and the applicant can decide where to make their application.",3
"Therefore, deporting an applicant to another state and jurisdiction and asking them to determine the case for us is an abrogation of our responsibilities and an abuse of the applicant’s rights.",3
"It would be a nightmare and simply would not work My second concern relates to Clause 9, which would allow the Home Office to strip people of UK citizenship unilaterally, secretly and without right of appeal.",3
"I was responsible for implementing the Bosnian refugee resettlement programme in the 1990s, which was of great credit to all those involved in its delivery.",3
"It was a good and legal route for many to escape persecution, complying with the necessary criteria as determined by UN and UK officials Why is this Bill attempting to create two categories of asylum seekers, and how can the arrival of an asylum seeker be determined as being either legal or illegal?",3
"As I stated earlier, there are no asylum seekers until asylum is requested, so a pre-application is difficult to define.",3
"There are legal and illegal immigrants, but this term cannot be easily transported to asylum seekers.",3
"Essentially, according to this Bill, all asylum seekers are therefore to be deemed illegal and we would not hear their claims at all.",3
"My Lords, I should come clean in that my family, the Teversons, are migrants themselves.",3
"There is no picture of us with horns coming out of our helmets, but we were definitely migrants into Suffolk.",3
I should like to concentrate on that a little because there are some unrealities that we talk about on asylum-seeking.,3
One issue is people smugglers.,2
"I condemn their gross activities but let us not pretend, as some Ministers do or imply, that migrants and asylum seekers across the channel somehow have traffickers with Kalashnikovs behind them who force them to come across the channel.",3
It does not solve the problem but tends to make those challenges even greater One of the other so-called realities that I need to challenge is the contention that we are a friendly nation for migrants.,2
There are 84 million refugees in the world.,2
Four out of 10 refugees are in five countries.,3
"The fifth country is Germany, in which there are 1.2 million refugees.",3
"Nevertheless, I have to ask the Government why Part 5, an entire section on modern slavery, has been thrown into this immigration Bill.",3
To conflate the two is to go against everything that we know about modern slavery and how traffickers work The Government have said that at the heart of the new plan for immigration is a simple principle—fairness.,3
"But the recovery period is set at 30 days in Clause 60(3), after which the Government can deport a person who no longer has right to remain.",3
Please will the Minister address this scenario in her remarks: could a victim in Northern Ireland have their support cut short because of deportation It is disappointing that there is no provision in Clause 63 for long-term support for confirmed victims of modern slavery once they have exited the NRM.,3
Section 18(9) of the human trafficking and exploitation Act provides for discretionary support to be continued following a positive conclusive grounds decision.,3
"I would like to see all confirmed victims in Northern Ireland receive at least 12 months statutory support once they exit the NRM, but that is a conversation for the Northern Ireland Assembly That said, only victims who are British citizens or who have received leave to remain—for instance, as an asylum seeker or under the current discretionary leave to remain for victims of trafficking and exploitation—are able to access long-term support in the devolved jurisdictions.",3
This has limited the number of confirmed victims who have been able to access the discretionary support in Northern Ireland and it has meant that individuals who may have received additional support have not done so as a result of their immigration status Clause 64 will have an impact on all victims of human trafficking and modern slavery across the UK who are not British citizens.,3
"My Lords, few of us would risk crossing the channel in a flimsy, inflatable dinghy, so we assume that anyone who does so must be fleeing a well-founded fear of persecution by an evil tyranny.",3
"But these boats do not set off from Basra, Iran or Africa; they come from Europe carrying people who have been in France, Belgium or Germany—none of which is a tyranny threatening them with persecution.",3
"For some, that reason is that they have been refused asylum or fear refusal in France, Germany or wherever, and they believe the UK is more likely to grant them asylum and, even if they are refused, they stand little risk of being deported.",4
"In France, only 25% of asylum applications are granted on first request, whereas the figure in the UK is 64%, plus 59% of those who appeal.",3
"Moreover, pre-Covid France forcibly deported 34,000 migrants a year—10 times as many as we did One reason for this difference is that the British standard of proof for granting asylum is unusually low.",3
Home Office guidance requires only a “reasonable degree of likelihood” that the asylum seeker is telling the truth.,3
Any well-coached economic migrant should have little difficulty providing a story meeting those criteria.,3
"The genuine victims of persecution may have no concrete evidence of their suffering and, if they lack coaching, may be rejected The truth is that we allocate the right to asylum by lottery, albeit with odds stacked heavily in favour of claimants.",3
"The price of a lottery ticket is over £10,000 to pay the people smugglers, which rules out the poorest people, plus willingness to risk the channel crossing.",3
We know what happens when you offer free tickets to a lottery for visas.,3
"The US allocates by lot 50,000 visas to people in a different list of countries each year.",3
"The response is huge; 20 million people applied for those 50,000 visas last time, including 13% of the population of Albania, 15% of Liberians and 9% of Armenians.",3
"As noble Lords observed in a previous debate, these are not the main countries from which migrants currently come—precisely.",3
"Does anyone imagine that fewer Iraqis, Afghans or Syrians would apply if we offered them a costless, riskless possibility of asylum in the UK?",4
They would be joined by a huge number of economic migrants from other poor and troubled lands.,2
"It is an anti-refugee Bill and an anti-asylum Bill and whatever the noble Lord, Lord Moylan, said about dismissing the concern for common humanity, it is a display of a lack of respect for our common humanity.",3
"The very idea of pushing boats back to the French coast is totally contrary to international and maritime law, as we have heard—but we do not even have to talk about its unlawfulness; it is about the morality of it Similarly, when we talk about offshoring and that proposal, it is not just unworkable, as the noble Lord, Lord Kirkhope, was saying; it, too, is a dereliction of our national duties under international law.",3
"As others have said, the Bill creates a two-tier system for asylum seekers.",3
"My Afghan judges are evacuated in Greece, Greece having agreed to be a lily pad, a temporary landing place, but they would be group 2 refugees, which means that they would have to stay in Greece because, of course, it is a safe country to all intents and purposes.",4
"Desperate women are also in communication with me still who escaped over the border into Pakistan, Iran or other neighbouring countries.",3
"They, too, would be group 2 refugees, even if they have a relative who lives in this country who is willing to receive them.",4
"Of course, Clause 15 makes it inadmissible to claim a special connection even if you have relatives in this country The Minister is right that there is a crisis in the immigration system, but this Bill is not going to solve it.",3
Around half of immigration appeals against Home Office decisions are successful in the First-tier Tribunal.,3
"But, instead of strengthening early decision-making, the Home Secretary is weakening appeals, creating fast-track processes that are unlawful and increasing her own arbitrary powers, taking to herself the power to accelerate hearings at such speed that there are likely to be illegal outcomes There is a whole set of clauses that I could refer to which deal with putting at speed decision-making without the proper legal advice that would make decisions safe.",3
"Although many changes have been made in recent years, including by a Conservative Government, the asylum system and some related policies are not fit for purpose.",3
There are those who think that one of the main thrusts of this legislation—greater national control of the asylum process and the elimination of abuses— is misplaced.,3
The process of claiming asylum should in their view be easier.,3
"I share the Home Secretary’s wish—I quote from Third Reading—to “bring in a new, comprehensive, fair but firm long-term plan that seeks to address the challenge of illegal migration head on.”—[Official Reort, Commons, 8/12/21; col.",3
"Somehow, the Home Office seems incapable of getting a grip and is being outflanked by the people smugglers.",3
"If this abuse can be resolved in no other way, I am coming to the view that the only way to resolve the problem is to adopt a new rule that all prospective asylum seekers who arrive in this way cannot be granted asylum.",3
"At a stroke, we need to find a way in which to put the traffickers out of business, as we saw in Australia Secondly, I turn to the wider question of deporting criminals, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Paddick.",3
I am particularly concerned by migrants passing themselves off as under 18.,3
"I have seen media reports that more than 1,100 migrants who claimed to be under 18 were found actually to be adults in the 12 months to September.",3
"Worse, it disrupts the education of British children, as these migrants end up in our classrooms.",2
It is reported that the Secretary of State for International Trade is considering offering student or other visas to India in exchange for a free trade agreement.,3
Our Immigration Rules are a national matter and should not be the subject of negotiation with any foreign country.,2
"I will be with him all the way in his opposition to this measure We have two objectives in tension here: we need to allay legitimate public concern about illegal immigration, but we must meet our duties, which are both moral and legal, to refugees.",3
We cannot have unlimited immigration—there has to be control—but we as a nation should meet our fair share of responsibility for dealing with the victims of abuse and atrocities in other parts of the world and people who cannot any more live safely in their own country.,2
"Will the Government re-examine that so that we can more effectively co-operate with security services in other countries Thirdly, on the speedier resolution of asylum claims, we have spent hundreds of millions of pounds on the borders question as a result of Brexit.",3
"Why are we not trying to ease the passage of goods at the borders and spending some of this money on speeding up asylum decisions Fourthly and finally, we must tackle the problem of refugees at the root.",3
"We have made what I regard as unacceptable cuts in our foreign aid budget, but if we are making cuts to it then the priority is to work even more with our partners and friends on trying to tackle the refugee problem at root.",3
How do the Government justify that as an approach to international co-operation in tackling the refugee crisis?,3
Lying behind this is the fact that the Government know that their claim that they would be able to stop immigration as a result of Brexit is false.,3
The first is obvious but none the less important for being so: illegal immigration is a problem that matters to people in this country and they expect us to find the right ways to deal with it.,2
"He also made clear the importance of our support for people who are fleeing persecution continuing, and why that places an even greater responsibility on us to deal with illegal immigrants Some measures in this legislation are contentious and will need to be scrutinised and debated, but we parliamentarians love to add complexity to the process of scrutiny, often in the name of safeguards and protections, which can make it even harder for those on the ground charged with implementing legislation to achieve results that meet people’s expectations But British citizens and anyone else living here legally deserve to know that our authorities can remove people who have no right to be here.",3
"The biggest problem with our current system is that illegal immigrants know that once they have made it to the UK, they are unlikely ever to be deported.",2
Those for whom such an idea amounts to heresy should understand that the case for this will only grow if we cannot deal better with unlawful immigration cases in a timely fashion with the laws that exist or that we need to implement I know that noble Lords approach their responsibilities seriously.,3
"But, at the same time, we must not lose sight of the millions of people, whether they were born in the UK or are themselves immigrants who have chosen to live here, who do not write to us but who support the three principal objectives of this Bill.",3
"First, what should it look like to take back control of our borders in a humane and legal way; and, secondly, how can Britain continue to be a place offering sanctuary to the world’s most vulnerable at a time of need Whether during the Holocaust or the flight of Ugandan Asians from Idi Amin, Britain has historically been a place of sanctuary.",4
"While I agree with the objectives of the Bill, I will start with why I am raising concerns that it may not achieve its stated aim, and I will then turn to areas where it could be constructively amended, which it would be good to explore in Committee As we have heard, the Bill aims to disincentivise so-called irregular entry through the creation of a two-tiered system, in the hope of producing what the Home Office calls the “pull factor” of the UK asylum system.",3
"In short, the pull factor is not our asylum system.",2
"Britain will always be an attractive place, even with a two-tiered refugee system Our Government’s own equality impact assessment recognises this, saying that “evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach”— that is, increased deterrence to encourage people to claim asylum elsewhere— “is limited” So can the Minister outline the Government’s reasons for weakening and potentially breaching the refugee convention by discriminating between people based on their arrival, and when there is such limited evidence of efficacy I also have concerns that the legislation as currently drafted would create a significantly greater administrative burden, making it even harder for the Home Office to process legitimate asylum claims.",3
"First, what estimate have Her Majesty’s Government made of the cost of needing to reassess a refugee’s protection needs every two and a half years?",3
What is Her Majesty’s Government’s assessment of this approach post the French elections There could be two further areas where the Government could improve this legislation to better protect and support those in need of asylum.,3
"Secondly, I wholeheartedly support the Migration Advisory Committee’s recent recommendation calling for the Government to institute the right to work for asylum seekers.",3
"The arguments for the right to work after six months, ranging from the benefit to the Exchequer to the boon to integration, are compelling.",3
"I will be tabling a cross-party amendment on this, and I hope to work with my noble friend the Minister on this matter I look forward to working as a House to support the Government to achieve their stated objectives and to ensure that our character as a compassionate nation is fully expressed, while ensuring that people smugglers are put out of business and vulnerable people are no longer exploited.",3
It is very welcome that the Government have resolved to take firm and decisive action to try to break the business model of people smugglers and protect the lives of those they endanger.,3
"We can be proud that we have provided refuge to more than 25,000 refugees from regions of conflict since 2015 and that we have enabled a further 29,000 closely related persons to join them subsequently It is also right that we should facilitate residents of Afghanistan who fought with us and residents of Hong Kong whose freedom is now threatened, who wish to build new lives in this country, to come here and help them become productive, participating citizens.",3
"I strongly support the plea made by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, concerning the former service men and women from Hong Kong, and look forward to the Minister’s reply to that question The migrant situation ranks highly on the list of matters on which people want the Government to get a grip.",3
"The noble Lord, Lord Paddick, also said that the Government should get a grip and focus on illegal immigration to this country, but went on to say that the Liberal Democrats oppose almost all of the Bill As pointed out by Nick Timothy in his interesting article in the Daily Telegraph on Monday, prior to the election of the Labour Government in 1997, net migration had peaked at 77,000 in 1994 and had never exceeded tens of thousands.",3
"When the coalition Government were elected in 2010, net migration was running at 250,000 a year The passing of the Human Rights Act and the Equality Act has made it harder to enforce immigration laws and to deport foreign criminals.",3
The number of those entering the country illegally is now also increasing exponentially.,2
"As your Lordships are all too aware, more than 28,000 people crossed the channel in small boats in 2021, three times as many as in the previous year.",3
"Despite 27 people being drowned out of a boatload of 29 when an inflatable dinghy collapsed on 24 November, there was no effect on high numbers crossing the channel in December I understand the arguments proposed by some noble Lords that the asylum applications made by some genuine refugees may be adversely affected by the Bill’s introduction of differential treatment of refugees.",3
"However, surely those refugees whose applications conform to the requirements contained in Article 31 of the refugee convention should not be disadvantaged by having to compete with those whose applications do not conform.",3
Surely it is right to try to protect those most at risk from human traffickers by including an additional hurdle that requires those who have entered the country unlawfully to show good cause I do not follow the argument of those who oppose the housing of asylum seekers in accommodation centres.,3
"Have the Government reached a consensus with stakeholders on the design of support packages to be offered to asylum seekers held in accommodation centres In general, I welcome the Bill, which makes a responsible and reasoned attempt to balance the rights of the British people, both individually and within their communities, with the rights of the growing number of migrants, which includes both genuine refugees and those who are not at risk in their own countries but simply choose to move for economic reasons.",3
"My Lords, in my limited time I will speak today only to Clause 9, which seeks to strip British citizens of their citizenship without notice.",3
"I want to focus on the real-life impact of this proposed legislation and the consequences for communities, and to unpick the notion that citizenship is a privilege, not a right Modern nationality law starts in 1981.",3
"However, what followed, with subsequent changes to nationality law and an increasingly hostile approach taken by successive Governments of all colours, was the appalling circumstances in which the Windrush generation and others—people who by right were British—were treated like outsiders, foreigners and aliens.",3
"Our hostility to immigration and immigrants was the climate in which we abandoned our own who were by right British, even if they had not formally exercised that right I lay out this background because this notion of citizenship being a privilege seems to be a popular, but sadly ignorant, mantra.",3
"Of course, immigration is not a right, but immigration and immigration controls are very distinct from nationality rights.",2
"By formally taking a British passport, they were merely formalising a right, not having a privilege bestowed upon them The othering of our fellow citizens—which has happened over the years under Conservative Governments; was made worse, I would argue, by Labour Governments, with some of the most dramatically expanded powers of deprivation; and was extended by the coalition Government—this chipping away at the basic right of citizenship, must now stop.",3
"This power grab by the Home Secretary is deeply dangerous, one that seeks to deprive someone of their right to citizenship without even giving the person being deprived the right to know, depriving them even of the right to check whether the Secretary of State had the legal basis or accurate facts to exercise that power.",3
"This clause is not a debate about immigration, it is a debate about our fellow citizens.",3
Is it that people have had bad encounters with refugees?,3
"Likely, I suspect, and so we should address those How is it that the Government’s priority is not to take a leadership role in integration, rather than creating tiers, different levels of protection—“differentials”, as the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, put it—and the deserving and undeserving?",3
"Instead, they make the environment aggressively hostile Among the many emails we have received opposing the Bill, I had one from a lady who wrote: “Although I do not believe that the current Front Bench is racist,”— I should say that I have just had another email which takes a contrary view, but I am not making that accusation myself— “it would be naive to imagine that it will always be ‘in the public interest’ for me and my parents to continue enjoying the ‘privilege’ of our British citizenship.” Let me say that we believe that the noble Lord, Lord Woolley, is in the public interest How many British citizens suddenly feel insecure?",3
"It seems we are to assume the worst of asylum seekers, victims of modern slavery and those who missed out on claiming citizenship—those who, in its words, are not the “cash cows” the Home Office expects My noble friends Lord Paddick and Lord Oates referred to comparative numbers of applications and refugees accepted in other countries, as did the noble Lords, Lord Rosser and Lord Dubs.",3
The starkest are the numbers being hosted by bordering states and by developing and middle-income countries.,3
"I do not think that is the same as not controlling borders, and it is not Marxist in any sense.",3
It feels more like offloading It is almost the least of it but requiring visa penalties for unco-operative countries baffles me; it is not my approach to co-operation or partnership.,3
"If a refugee cannot sponsor an application, does this not incentivise dangerous journeys, particularly by women and girls?",3
"The Bill, perversely, plays into the smugglers’ business model.",3
"Even the clauses righting historical omissions regarding citizenship are overshadowed, and Clause 10 is plain unjust.",3
"It is well known that victims of slavery and trafficking, as well as those fleeing persecution, oppression and tyranny, cannot immediately tell the whole or even much of their story.",3
The Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner makes very balanced and powerful comments—to use a neutral term—including on the danger of viewing victims through an immigration lens and ignoring their trauma and exploitation.,3
"Language can be misleading; an expedited or accelerated process sounds attractive, but so did “detained fast track”, as a term, which the Court of Appeal, rightly, brought to an end Like the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, I am concerned about the criminalisation that may spill over to individuals and organisations that seek to support asylum seekers.",3
"Judging from the support that we have seen for the RNLI, that view is widely shared I hope that the Minister will be able to detail what routes there are by which an asylum seeker can come direct from countries from which so many flee—Iran, Iraq, Eritrea, Yemen, Sudan, Vietnam and so on.",3
"What is being done to create safe and legal routes, and why is there no provision for humanitarian visas?",2
"We are all united in the belief that we need to tackle illegal immigration and have control over our borders but that, as my noble friend Lord Reid said, we should not do so at the expense of putting forward unworkable solutions which will do nothing to deal with the problems we are confronted with.",3
"I believe that the whole country is united by a belief that there is an issue around illegal immigration, but I am also convinced that people want it dealt with in a fair, equitable way that reflects the traditions of our country over the decades.",3
"I am proud of that, as your Lordships’ House will be, so why have the Government introduced a Bill that makes changes for asylum seekers and refugees, altering the current system for asylum claims and appeals and introducing measures on people-smuggling and modern slavery and a two-tier system for asylum seekers arriving in the UK, with differentiation based on method of arrival?",3
"As my noble friends Lord Dubs and Lady Chakrabarti and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham said, refugees are people.",3
"Our values must be applied; our country will be judged on the way in which we treat refugees and asylum seekers In Committee, we can debate and discuss this Bill line by line, but Second Reading allows us to set out the context, principles and broad sweep of policy which should guide the general topics as we go forward.",3
"I remind the House, since a political point has been made once or twice, that the Government say this Bill is needed to fix the asylum system; they have been in control of that system for 12 years, so why have initial asylum decisions fallen by 40% over the last five years, under their watch, with 67,000 people waiting for an initial decision?",3
"I understand from what the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and others have said that we did not get everything right, but we rejected many of the proposals put forward in this Bill On illegal entry, the Bill proposes to change the immigration offence of how someone enters the UK and specifies the mode of entry as legal or illegal.",3
"The Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association says that it is contrary to international law; Article 31 of the refugee convention provides that states “shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees … where their life or freedom was threatened” Do we care?",4
"As the noble Lords, Lord German, Lord Hannay and Lord Oates; the noble Baroness, Lady Prashar; my noble friends Lord Dubs, Lord Ponsonby, Lord Griffiths, Lord Reid, Lady Lister, Lady Chakrabarti and many others have stated across this Chamber, this country seeks to ensure that international treaties and obligations are met by others, and we should ensure that we meet them ourselves Group 1 and group 2 refugees will be created by the Bill, based on how they arrived into the UK and the point at which they presented themselves to the authorities.",3
"Those who have travelled via a third country, do not have documents or did not claim asylum immediately will be designated group 2 refugees—sub-standard refugees, not real refugees.",3
The UNHCR again says: “The design of this new Group 2 refugee status is incompatible with the 1951 convention.” It does not say that it has a problem with it: it says it is incompatible with the convention.,3
"There are no return agreements with EU countries, and family reunion routes for refugees and asylum seekers in Europe, including children, have been cut.",3
Is it not the case that there were just five asylum seekers returned to European countries in the last year while channel crossings have soared?,3
It failed when she said that we would halve boats across the channel in three months and make them infrequent in six months.,3
"As the noble Lords, Lord McColl, Lord Alton and Lord Morrow, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London, and my noble friend Lord Rosser in his brilliant speech all pointed out, the Modern Slavery Act is undermined by an immigration and asylum Bill.",3
She said she was concerned that the public order disqualifications threshold and the time period on slavery and trafficking information notices would have that effect.,3
"Those are not my words, or words from a Labour Government now or in the past, but the words of a former Prime Minister of this country saying what the current Conservative Government are going to do to the Modern Slavery Act that she, and all of us, were so proud of The Government say that they want to deter people from using the defence of being a victim of modern slavery against deportation.",3
"Does the Minister realise how ridiculous it is to expect somebody traumatised by modern slavery or trafficking to be able to present themselves within a short, specified time to the police or others with these identification notices, otherwise they will be deemed to have failed?",3
"Will the Ministers say to me, to this House, to this Chamber and to this country that, if I were a navigator on a boat passing people at sea and in danger, it will be a criminal offence, as under the Bill as currently constituted it will be, for me to stop and help them?",3
"There is much to debate and we will seek to amend the Bill as it goes forward, protecting the victims of modern slavery, including children, with safe routes for unaccompanied children, safe routes for family reunion of unaccompanied children and negotiations with the EU for a new asylum agreement, including safe legal routes and safe returns, maintaining our respect for international law and agreements.",3
The Bill will not solve the problem of dangerous boat crossings and will not improve security co-operation or create safe legal routes.,3
It will make it harder to prosecute and convict people traffickers and will grant the Home Secretary the power to decide asylum cases based on how someone arrives in this country.,3
"It will give the Home Office the power to deprive a person of their British citizenship without warning—third-class citizenship, as one noble Peer mentioned.",3
"This country has a proud tradition of supporting asylum seekers and refugees, and this Bill is not part of that.",3
"It is also about illegal migrants Going back to international partners, we expect them to engage with us and we have tried to work with them to build on our good current co-operation and continue to highlight the importance of having effective returns agreements to stop people making perilous crossings.",3
"This is an established principle of any functioning migration relationship, and it enables us to maintain public confidence in our immigration system We have already signed agreements with India and Albania.",3
"There are more people here illegally from India than from any other country, and there are more foreign criminals from Albania than from anywhere else.",2
"Beyond this, we will seek to negotiate readmissions arrangements with key EU member states which have a mutual interest in preventing asylum seekers moving between safe countries.",3
"This Government remain committed to our international obligations, including the 1951 refugee convention and the European Convention on Human Rights.",3
It is indeed the fundamental feature of the common European asylum system.,3
"Without any enforcement of it, we simply encourage criminal smugglers to continue to exploit vulnerable migrants Today’s debate has shown that there is no silver bullet when it comes to fundamental reform.",3
"We are overhauling a decades-old system, but the whole package of measures within the Bill and the wider reforms that sit alongside it will help to put people smugglers out of business and deter illegal entry to the UK I finish by reiterating the key objectives of the Bill: to make the system fairer and more effective; to deter illegal entry to the UK; and to remove more easily from the UK those with no right to be here.",3
"The Home Office must deport dangerous foreign criminals who have no right to be in our country and who should be returned to the country of their citizenship, which is precisely why the last Labour Government introduced stronger laws to that effect.",3
The Home Office also has a responsibility to get its deportation decisions right.,3
"As the Government have themselves admitted, during the Windrush scandal the Home Office made grave errors in both detention and deportation decisions, and it is currently failing on all counts The Opposition are committed to the principles of an immigration system that is firm, fair and well managed.",3
"First and foremost, it is deeply troubling that a number of expert reports over recent years have pointed to how Home Office failures have resulted in fewer foreign criminals being deported than should be the case.",3
"Indeed, in 2015, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration stated that one in three failures to deport foreign criminals was a result of Home Office failure.",3
"Fast-forward to 2022, and the latest immigration figures show that the Home Office is still failing miserably in this regard Under the current Prime Minister and Home Secretary, there has been a stark decline in the number of foreign national offenders being returned and deported.",3
"In the year ending September 2021, 2,732 foreign national offenders were returned from the UK—20% fewer than the previous year and 47% fewer than in 2019, the year before the pandemic began.",3
"Even more staggering is the fact that, according to a 2019 Public Accounts Committee report, the Home Office had to release six in every 10 migrant detainees whom the Department wanted to deport, and it simply could not explain why this was happening The PAC also raised concerns about the need for earlier and better legal advice, which would make it more likely that decisions were accurate and robust, rather than being overturned due to poor decisions later in the process.",3
"The level of sheer incompetence is not only a threat to our security; it ultimately erodes the confidence of the British public and foreign nationals alike, because the system fails to fulfil the basic crucial principles of being firm, fair and well managed.",3
Perhaps he could therefore answer the following questions: how many foreign offenders have absconded in the last 12 months?,3
Does the Home Office actually have a plan that will address the currently shambolic nature of the deportation system The British people deserve better than this.,3
The EU has a strong role to play in helping the resilience of neighbouring countries such as through migrant flows in Belarus.,3
"If 1 million refugees appear in Hungary, Romania or Poland, I would urge the EU to step up and think about what it is going to do about millions of refugees on its soil rather than think about it afterwards.",3
"Gentleman mentioned the integrated review, but I think the situation is actually the opposite of what he said: if we read the full integrated review and the defence Command Paper, they show that we have to be ready.",3
Many of the forces we now see massed on Ukraine’s border were in fact pre-positioned in April following an exercise and then went home to barracks.,3
"I absolutely supported at the time, and still do, a register of foreign agents.",3
"I want to return to Lords Amendment 1, which provides for the Chagossians to acquire British citizenship and British Overseas Territories citizenship.",3
I hope that these amendments will now also be accepted by your Lordships’ House Amendment 4 relates to the deprivation of citizenship.,3
"I therefore invite the noble Baroness to withdraw this amendment Amendments 13 to 19 relate to the offence of illegal arrival in the UK, a key element of the Bill.",3
"I will set out in more detail what the Government mean when we say that we are seeking prosecutions only in the most egregious cases for this offence We will take firm action against migrants who put themselves or others, including rescuers, in danger by their actions—for example, where migrants have been seen dangling children over the side of a boat and threatening to drop them into the channel, or dousing themselves in fuel to prevent them being picked up by French search and rescue services because they did not want to be taken back to France.",3
"This would apply to instances such as those which occurred in 2020 with the stowaways on the “Nave Andromeda”, which led to the crew locking themselves in the ship’s citadel in accordance with the ship’s safety manual and making a mayday call Additionally, we will be targeting for prosecution migrants who cause severe disruption to services such as shipping routes, or closure of the Channel Tunnel.",3
This happened in 2015 when a group of migrants forced their way into the tunnel despite the attempts of French officials and police to prevent them doing so.,3
"The migrants’ actions meant that the power supply to the tunnel had to be shut down and rail traffic suspended We will also focus on those who have arrived in the UK without permission in cases where they are criminals who have previously been deported from the UK, persons subject to exclusion decisions or persons who have been repeatedly removed as failed asylum seekers.",3
"On this basis, your Lordships’ House should not insist on these amendments The noble Lord, Lord Coaker, has tabled Amendment 13B in lieu of Amendment 13, which would make it an offence for persons to knowingly arrive in the UK in breach of a deportation order.",3
"Although I welcome the recognition that we need to be able to prosecute criminals who seek to evade immigration controls and return to the UK, we cannot accept this amendment, as it is just too narrow.",3
I therefore hope that the noble Lord will not press his amendment Amendment 20 would reinsert the requirement to prove that a person is acting “for gain” if they are being prosecuted for facilitating the entry of an asylum seeker into the UK.,3
It means that prosecutors are limited in the action that they can take against people smugglers.,3
"The amendment could result in an unacceptable gap in UK border security, which would allow persons of interest or risk who would otherwise be refused an ETA to enter the UK legally.",3
"An important part of this is our absolute commitment not to have any checks at the Ireland-Northern Ireland border, and British and Irish citizens will not be required to obtain an ETA.",3
"Neither will those who already have an immigration status in the UK—for example, those with a frontier worker permit.",4
"However, as now, all individuals—except British and Irish citizens—arriving in the UK, including those crossing the land border into Northern Ireland, need to continue to enter, in line with the UK’s immigration framework.",3
"It will be valid for multiple trips over an extended period, so that this is not disruptive to lives or livelihoods, minimising the burden on those making frequent trips, including across the Ireland-Northern Ireland border, while protecting the common travel area from abuse as far as possible On the possible impacts on tourism, I assure the House that the Government are committed to working with a wide range of stakeholders, including Tourism Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland.",3
It will also mitigate any risk of increased barriers to cross-border tourism on the island of Ireland.,3
"It is a shame that it is not in the Bill but, if that undertaking has been given, we can perhaps trust the Government on this occasion We are pleased that the Government have adopted the safeguards proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Anderson of Ipswich, before someone can be deprived of British citizenship without notice; we believe this will reverse the recent increase in the number of cases and, hopefully, reduce it to almost zero.",3
"We agree with Motion B1, Amendment 4G, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady D’Souza, to remove the validation of previous deprivations of citizenship without notice, which the courts have held to be unlawful.",3
"As the Government acknowledge, the “Anderson safeguards” are necessary, so the Home Office should go back over existing cases of deprivation of citizenship without notice, applying these safeguards to ensure that they are lawful We agree with Motion L1 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, as a mechanism for preventing those arriving in but not entering the UK, and then claiming asylum, from being criminalised.",3
"For the Government to say that only egregious cases would be prosecuted is not sufficient, as the fact that arriving in the UK and then claiming asylum could be a criminal offence would have a chilling effect on those legitimately seeking refuge in the UK; this is, of course, exactly what the Government intend by their Motion L. I ask the House to support my Motion M1.",3
"The Government want to criminalise those who facilitate those entering the UK without the correct prior authority, even if those doing so are not people smugglers and not acting for their own gain.",3
"The perhaps unintended consequence is that those rescuing drowning migrants in the English Channel, for example, commit an offence unless the rescue is co-ordinated by HM Coastguard or an equivalent organisation.",3
"Rescuers would then know that, provided they are acting in good faith, they would not be prosecuted, but people smugglers would not have a reasonable excuse and could be prosecuted.",3
"The Government’s suggestion that people smugglers might pretend to be genuine rescuers is, quite frankly, ridiculous, as there are likely to be many witnesses, in the form of the migrants who have paid large sums to the people smugglers, that this is not the case.",3
"One thing we all agree on is that there should be no checks or barriers along the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, and certainly there should be no barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.",3
"I agree with those who have argued that there should be no checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic and vice versa As someone who lives just about 15 miles from the border, I understand the concerns.",3
"First, we are talking about an international border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic and between the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic.",4
"All these things matter, and it is wrong to dismiss the guarantees and agreements that were made in the Belfast agreement, as amended by the St Andrews agreement, because it enshrined the principle of consent and that the people of Northern Ireland should remain part of the United Kingdom so long as they voted that way The second thing to say gently to the House is that there were checks for immigration on the UK side and on the Irish Republic side of the border—not at the border because nobody wants to stay at the border—even before we left the European Union.",3
"I am looking at a tweet put out by the Garda and PSNI in 2018, which eulogises and praises a checkpoint near the Monaghan/Armagh border seeking those in breach of immigration law.",3
Eight illegal immigrants were caught at a checkpoint in Dundalk just across the Irish border by the Garda Síochána after travelling via England and Northern Ireland.,3
"These checks are not done at the border but they are intelligence-led, so it is wrong to suggest that somehow any checks are contrary to the spirit of the Belfast agreement because that is exactly the sort of regime that will apply going forward as it did previously The final thing I will say, very briefly, is that—as I mentioned at the start—we must have the same considerations and the same passion and desire to avoid problems against the spirit of the Belfast agreement which has been evoked today and we must ensure that it applies east-west for strand 3 as it does for strand 2.",3
"In June 2021, the European Union, as published by the DAERA department in January of this year, was complaining to the UK Government that ferry passengers coming from Great Britain into Larne or Belfast, where there is no border at all—British citizens moving from one part of the United Kingdom to the other—were not having their luggage checked.",3
"This shows Parliament at its best and, hopefully, with respect to other issues that I and other noble Lords will raise through our amendments, we will see the same happen elsewhere before the Bill becomes an Act On Motions B and B1, the deprivation of citizenship in certain cases, with proper safeguards, is an important tool of our national security.",3
We do not believe that the Government have made the case for the suggested powers under Clause 9 to remove citizenship without giving notice.,3
"I will be interested to hear the Minister’s response to the noble Baroness with respect to her Motion B1 On Motion L and my Motion L1, the proposed arrival offence makes arriving in the UK to seek asylum a criminal act.",3
"At the same time, Ministers have repeatedly stated that they do not intend it to be used in all circumstances to which it applies A specific example of what we are talking about came up last week in the debate in the other place when considering a Ukrainian who had fled to the UK to join their family in the first few days after the appalling Russian invasion to escape the bombing and destruction of their home, but who had not completed a lengthy visa process.",3
"That cannot be right The Government say that we need to ensure that there are safe and legal routes, and much of this has been driven by what has happened with respect to migrants crossing the channel.",3
"As Damian Green MP, a former Immigration Minister, asked of the Government, “Home Office data confirms that 87% of those arriving by small boats in 2021 comprised nationals from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen,”—[Official Report, Commons; 22/3/22; col.",3
"The Bill does not make sense in this regard Throughout the passage of the Bill, as I say, Ministers have repeatedly said that this offence is intended to be prosecuted only in specific cases, such as where a person arrives in the UK in breach of a deportation order.",3
"So, our Amendment 13B would provide a specific offence of arriving in the UK in breach of a deportation order.",3
"We have been raising this issue for months; the border is still an afterthought, and we are seeking to clear the issue up at this juncture.",3
The problem is that the proposed approach is not only unworkable but does not reflect the reality of those who live and work on the border at all.,3
"Essentially, the Bill has come forward as an enabling Bill to allow the Government to address the issue of illegal crossings of the channel, so we are doing things the wrong way round.",3
"In this case, dealing with cross-channel migrants, we must deal with foreign Governments.",3
"The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, made the point, which I think is the Opposition’s principal position, that the problem would be solved if we could open legal routes to all the refugees who wish to come to this country.",3
We are looking only at the enabling legislation I fully accept the additional point that we must look at the effect on refugees of international law.,3
"For example, in response to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, the vote in the House of Commons was a majority of 98 against his proposal that there should be differentiation between group 1 and group 2—that decision to differentiate passed by a majority of 98 in the House of Commons That is a massive majority and reflects not just questions of law but the justified concern of the House of Commons about human trafficking across the channel.",3
I am sure that we are all concerned about refugees not only from Ukraine but from other countries —everyone is concerned about that—but how we stop illicit human trafficking across the channel is a separate issue.,2
"My Lords, in Motion C the Government claim that the provisions in Part 2 are compliant with the UN refugee convention—in which case, they should have no objection to Motion C1 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, which puts such an assertion on the face of the Bill to ensure that the courts are able to test Part 2 against the UN refugee convention.",3
"In accordance with the Government’s claim in Motion C, the Government must surely agree with Motion D1 that, whether the Government categorise a refugee as falling into group 1 or group 2, as set out in the Bill, none the less, both groups must be given all the rights under the UN refugee convention.",3
"If not, Part 2, contrary to the Government’s claim in Motion C, would not be compliant with the UN refugee convention My noble friend Lady Hamwee has dealt with Motion E1 on the right to work, and Motion H1 on family reunion, which we also support.",3
"Once Parliament has seen the countries that the Government propose to use for such an abhorrent practice, and the costs involved, we hope that no Parliament would approve such a practice The Ukrainian refugee crisis and the lamentable shambles created by insisting that those fleeing Putin’s war must have a visa to enter the UK, with the Home Office being unable to cope with the numbers of applications, clearly demonstrates the need for there to be appropriate resourcing, infrastructure and support for local authorities permanently in place to cope with such crises before they arise.",3
"Of course, we also support the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, in his Motion K1 in relation to those fleeing genocide I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, that less than 20% of immigration to the UK in recent years has been asylum seekers, and the Bill deals only with that 20%.",3
"I ask the noble Lord, Lord Horam: where are the provisions that specifically target people smugglers in the Bill?",3
"I wonder how often France has been called “safe” in this Chamber over the centuries, but I think we can accept that it is safe for most refugees— except for those who do not like garlic, who may need to escape.",3
"What has been going on in the channel is appalling and should concern us all, because it is led by people smugglers; it is led by evil people and it has led to deaths, and we need to prevent further lives from being lost on this dangerous crossing and break the business model of the criminal gangs who exploit desperation Since the joint intelligence centre was established in July 2020 we have, with France, dismantled 17 small boat organised crime groups and secured over 400 arrests.",3
"UK immigration enforcement has secured 67 convictions of the criminals driving small boat crossings since January 2020, resulting in sentences totalling over 54 years.",3
"Our Nationality and Borders Bill will give us more powers, including being able to do things like check people’s age so we know the facts when people claim asylum, which should make our system firmer and fairer.",3
"None of us wants a repeat of last night, although I salute the Clerks for their valiant attempts with the papers On Tuesday, the Home Secretary gave a statement on her shameful proposal to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, an unethical policy that would cost taxpayers billions and make it harder to get fast and fair asylum decisions.",3
"At the same time, however, Members from across the House are reporting to me significant delays because of a Home Office backlog across all policy areas, from passport applications—delays to which will affect all our constituents—to visas and everything in between.",3
"This is not about civil servants; it is about leadership from the top Will the Leader of the House ask the Home Secretary to explain how visa applications are being processed by the Department, what she is doing about the unacceptable delays to passports, and how she intends to carry out her unworkable policy to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?",3
"In fact, does she understand that the term “illegal asylum seekers” does not even make sense, as by international law asylum seekers are allowed to come here to seek asylum, and if they have not been assessed, they cannot be illegal by definition While we are on the subject of the Home Secretary, it took me three months to get a response from her last year, but at least I got one.",3
This Government are determined not just to reform what is a broken asylum system—we are lifting up every aspect of the dysfunctionality of the system—but to tackle the root causes of illegal migration.,3
"In March 2021 the new plan for immigration was published, and we had the Nationality and Borders Bill in this House last autumn.",3
They do not really want to support an end to illegal migration or stop the people smugglers.,3
"We were implored to listen to public opinion to restrict immigration, but this Bill is not about restricting the over 90% of immigration to the UK that is nothing to do with refugees.",3
"This Bill is targeted at asylum seekers like those fleeing Ukraine, who, in recent years, accounted for about 4% of immigration to the UK, and it is aimed at victims of modern slavery: people being trafficked and exploited by ruthless people smugglers as well as many being exploited in this country who were born in the UK Public opinion shows that British people welcome refugees; this Bill shuns them.",3
It is consistent with the Government making another grave mistake in using the new-found freedom from the European Union to place barriers in the way of Ukrainian refugees instead of waiving visas as the rest of the EU has done.,3
Our world-leading migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda is a global first and will change the way we collectively tackle illegal immigration.,3
This is a global problem that requires international solutions Rwanda is a fundamentally safe and secure country with a track record of supporting asylum seekers.,4
Individuals will be relocated to Rwanda and have their asylum claims processed by the Rwandan authorities.,3
The partnership is an important part of our reform of the broken asylum and migration system.,3
This evil trade must be stopped The principle of the plan is simple: people will no longer be able to pay evil people smugglers to go to a destination of their choice while passing through sometimes several safe countries.,3
"If someone comes from a safe country, they are picking the UK as a preferred destination Uncontrolled immigration reduces our capacity to help those who most need our support.",2
"As I have said many times before in this House, there is no one single solution, but this Government will deliver the first comprehensive overhaul of the asylum system in decades.",3
"If anything, this leads to the total shredding of the refugee convention.",3
This cash-for-deportations policy is akin to state-sponsored trafficking and transportation.,2
"As I understand it, such a difficult process is being crammed into a 30-minute interview with two immigration officers, with young people left unaware of their rights to challenge the decision that they are an adult.",3
"How on earth can such vulnerable people as trafficking victims, torture survivors and LGBT people be identified by a basic screening interview, which is another process that the Minister know takes a long time?",3
"Why is it permissible at all for trafficking survivors to be part of the inadmissibility procedures Access to legal advice is crucial, so let me ask: can the Minister confirm how many of those scheduled to be on the flight tomorrow have not yet been able to seek legal advice?",3
"He knows that the overwhelming balance of legal opinion, including that of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is that this policy is totally illegal.",3
"Will the Minister confirm that the Rwandan asylum system has capacity only for a couple of hundred new cases each year, and has he been made aware of the evidence that, even now, more risky routes are already being tried by smugglers as a result In conclusion, this will not hurt horrendous people smugglers one jot, but it will badly hurt those who have fled persecution and sought protection here, and this policy brings shame on the UK internationally.",3
"On the morning we were there, a boat of 38 Albanians came in, and we met some of them.",3
"We need practical solutions to deal with people who are jumping the queue of genuine asylum seekers and refugees, to whom we owe a duty of care, so I hope the flights start and that message gets out loud and clear I have one query for the Minister.",3
"We interviewed Her Majesty’s inspector of borders and immigration last week, and there are still some concerns about the monitoring process that will be happening in Rwanda itself.",3
"Many of these issues are devolved matters, but this is such important work—a lot of good work is taking place through the integrated end-to-end approach, and also through the scorecards that we are now setting up—that I would be very happy for the hon.",3
The Act increases the sentences for those coming here illegally and means that people-smugglers face life behind bars.,3
"It also makes it easier for us to remove dangerous foreign criminals, as demanded by the British public but not by those on the Opposition Benches or those lawyers working to undermine the will of the public.",3
It is why we have developed our world-leading migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda to deter illegal entry.,2
"It will introduce new offences to address state-backed sabotage, foreign interference, the theft of trade secrets and the assisting of a foreign intelligence service.",3
The Bill will for the first time make it an offence to be a covert foreign spy on our soil.,3
"A foreign influence registration scheme will require individuals to register certain arrangements with foreign Governments, to help prevent damaging or hostile influence being exerted by them here.",3
"To this Government even international law is almost inconsequential, broken quite readily, whether in a specific and limited way or by a complete trashing of the refugee convention This is a Government too often pursuing pet obsessions and short-term headlines instead of dealing with the basics.",3
People just want their passports delivered on time!,3
"Despite all the fuss made by Brexiteers, it does not matter what colour the passports are if they arrive too late.",3
"The Home Secretary very generously agreed to take away individual cases, but I think she will find that her inbox will be absolutely overflowing with thousands of emails if we take her up on that If the Government are to insist on Ukrainians applying for visas—we continue to argue that they should not—then they need to be delivered speedily and efficiently, because leaving those fleeing war in limbo is unforgivable.",3
"In fact, the whole asylum and immigration system needs to be sped up, with decision making improved and the hostile environment ditched.",3
"If the Government are serious about the lessons learned from that disaster, we need a more serious set of actions to implement Wendy Williams’ recommendations, including a migrants commissioner All those very basic issues need to be addressed, but instead what we get in this Queen’s Speech are further attacks on our rights.",3
"We have welcomed the online safety Bill and we recognise that it is now truer than ever that feeling safe requires regulation of the online as much as the offline We also support the ideas mentioned in relation to the modern slavery Bill, particularly around action on supply chains, but any modern slavery Bill worthy of the name should repeal some of the provisions of the odious Nationality and Borders Act 2022, which was passed just last month and which will undoubtedly make life worse, not better, for victims of trafficking, including those who face being sent to Rwanda.",3
"But here in the UK, the Tories can rewrite the constitutional settlement to suit themselves in the blink of an eye, such is the lack of checks and constraints on them A Home Office focused on Scotland would tear up the immigration system that has served us so badly, left us without the people we desperately need for our economy and public services, and undermined the rights and security of so many of the people we already have welcomed.",3
"It would utterly reject an asylum system that is expressly and increasingly designed to make people suffer If we really wanted to prevent crime and deliver justice, we would overhaul the out-of-date Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, which exacerbates one of the most persistent and difficult public health challenges that we face today.",3
"Nor does this Queen’s Speech contain any measures to compensate my constituents for the serial incompetence of the Home Office in respect of not just the handling of immigration and asylum cases, but the issuing of passports.",3
"Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis), who is not in his place and for whom I have great respect, even though I disagree with him on this issue, tried to suggest that the main reason for modifying the Human Rights Act is that it will give the Government the ability to deport foreign criminals who have been released from prison.",3
"Is that the extent of the Government’s ambition The borders Bill summed up the failure of the Home Office, which is unable to properly process refugees’ applications, leaving them to wait years for proper and decent outcomes, and unable to create safe and legal routes for refugees, of which there are none at the moment for the vast majority of people in the world—none, in fact, for anyone outside Afghanistan and Ukraine.",3
The only legal route to claim asylum is to make an illegal crossing.,2
"Indeed, it is not just those applying for asylum who are suffering from Home Office mismanagement; ordinary people cannot even get their passports from the Home Office, such is the incompetence in that Department On conversion therapy, we have a Bill that is completely useless.",3
"In the previous Session, we battled against the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, which will strip people of their right to protest, among other terrifying measures; the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022, which has serious implications for access to justice and the accountability of public bodies; and, finally, the Nationality and Borders Act 2022, which is set to treat asylum seekers and refugees in ways that I can describe only as nightmarish.",3
"This Government thought it was perfectly acceptable to mention, alongside reference to those poor, desperate refugees who are forced to cross the channel in the most perilous of conditions, what they say are plans to help the police to make the streets safer—in the same paragraph of the Queen’s Speech.",3
It is a deliberate attack on asylum seekers and refugees This Tory Government’s shameless propaganda says that anyone who flees persecution and tries to get to safety on these islands is a criminal.,3
"And it is working: many people on these islands are doing everything they can to welcome and support refugees—I thank and pay tribute to them, and I thank God for them—but many people repeat the tropes that the Government have so cynically created.",3
"We need only to listen back to some of the similarly worded interventions in the last debate on the Nationality and Borders Bill from Government Back Benchers who had never previously shown an interest Today, the attacks have moved to those of us who support refugees.",3
People are lying under immigration control vans to stop deportations.,3
"My Lords, only six months ago we were describing the chaotic retreat from Afghanistan as the biggest failure of western foreign policy for decades.",3
"That was a fair description, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine tops it because the invasion is not simply a success of Russian military strength but is an equal, collective failure of the West to recognise that Putin was pursuing an aggressive, forward foreign policy which was aimed not just at those territories which he wished to control but at the values of democracy and the rule of law that they embody and the subsequent failure on our part to take measures to counter that This invasion follows other Russian power grabs in Crimea, Georgia and Moldova and increasing Russian influence more broadly in the Middle East and Africa.",3
"Post Brexit, the UK has not been part of European, non-NATO discussions on security and foreign policy.",3
"Can the Minister give the House an assurance that they will now be pursued with vigour and, in particular, will the Government release any evidence they have of Russian interference in British politics whether or not they deem it to have been successful One of the most predictable results of the invasion is that there will be large numbers of refugees.",3
All Ukrainian citizens will be allowed to enter the EU on a Ukrainian passport.,4
"Will the Government also consider granting visas to Ukrainians who are working for UK companies in Ukraine, often in tech-related roles, who might now wish to come to live and work here Finally, can we have more clarity on what the Government plan to do to support our NATO allies in eastern Europe?",3
We were told yesterday that two fighters were being despatched to Cyprus to patrol NATO’s south-eastern borders.,3
"The Estonians, I know, are extremely grateful for the British-led contingent of 1,200 NATO troops who are now stationed their border with Russia, but they are under no illusion that they are anything more than a tripwire and would be rapidly swept aside in the event of any Russian advance.",3
Can the Minister tell us what representations the Government are making to that effect Many thousands of Ukrainians have headed to the borders following the Russian invasion.,3
"Slovakia has opened its borders and is allowing every Ukrainian to enter Slovakia, even without a passport.",3
Poland will be receiving many Ukrainian refugees.,3
Ireland has waived visa requirements on Ukrainians.,3
"Meanwhile, here, it is bitterly ironic that on Monday we will be debating Report on the Nationality and Borders Bill, one provision of which is the criminalisation of anyone who reaches these shores without a visa Our Home Secretary has extended visas for Ukrainians who are already here, which is welcome, but has not set up any routes for most Ukrainian refugees to reach UK shores.",3
"The UK has stopped accepting visa applications from Ukrainians stuck in the country, and even family members of British citizens can apply only in Lviv or in a neighbouring country.",3
This means there is no safe and legal route for most Ukrainians to seek asylum in Britain.,3
"This crisis is a perfect example of our reduced influence since we left the EU, as the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, has said, and indeed of our not seeking any continuing role in the institutional architecture of EU foreign security and sanctions policy.",3
"The boast of “global Britain” looks more than a little hollow when it consists of reintroducing blue passports and imperial measurements rather than helping Europe speak with one voice One essential element of our longer-term strategy must be to make this country as sound and robust in its liberal democracy as it possibly can be, to equip us, with our allies, to be a beacon to the world for liberal values, and to work as closely as possible with those who share them in order to demonstrate to rogue states such as Russia, and their peoples, not only that might is not right but that their aspirations deserve freedom, democracy and human rights.",3
"I will try to respond to all the points raised, but there were a lot, and if I miss any, I will follow up in writing Putin’s unprovoked, illegal war is a reprehensible, premeditated attack on Ukraine and on the principles of self-determination and the rule of law.",3
"In April, the Foreign Secretary announced a £10 million fund to help expert organisations support victims of the conflict, including, of course, survivors of sexual violence In response to the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, on the visa situation in relation to Ukrainian refugees, I was looking up the numbers while he was speaking, and our two visa schemes will allow an unlimited number of Ukrainians to find safety in the UK, working through either family members or UK sponsors.",3
"As of 1 June, we had issued more than 120,000 visas in total for the Ukraine family scheme and the Homes for Ukraine sponsoring scheme.",3
They are in a very difficult position and are doing this country proud Putin’s acts of aggression confirm the trends and threats we set out in the integrated review.,3
"As the noble Viscount, Lord Waverley, and the noble Lords, Lord West and Lord Collins, pointed out, the integrated review did identify Russia as the most acute threat to security in the Euro-Atlantic area, and it set out our commitment to deterring and defending against that threat.",3
"Like my noble friend Lady Meyer, the noble Lord, Lord West, and others, I do not agree with the assertions made by some noble Lords that the war in Ukraine is in any way at odds with the conclusions we drew in the integrated review—on the contrary.",3
"These are also top priorities in the integrated review, as emphasised again in the international development strategy We share an unwavering commitment to European security.",3
"We have also been developing new agreements with key European partners, and that includes the joint declaration on foreign and security policy with Germany, and similar new foreign policy co-operation agreements with the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Norway.",3
"Member for Luton North (Sarah Owen)—for our new free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand We are using our new freedoms to control our borders, with a new plan for immigration so that we can fix our broken asylum system, tackle the illegal immigration that undermines the legal immigration that we support and crack down on the vile people smugglers.",3
"I know that the Leader of the Opposition—perhaps I should, in deference to his phrase, refer to him as the Leader of the Opposition of the moment—likes to claim he opposes these plans, but it turns out that legislation to permit the offshoring of asylum seekers—",3
"This amendment would add the failure to produce identifying documents as a factor that could be taken into account in an asylum or human rights claim and might damage a claimant’s credibility The background to this is my concern that migrants, especially those coming across the channel in boats, are destroying any documents they have because they believe—usually on the advice of the people smugglers— that they will secure better treatment under the asylum system.",3
"I fear that the system we operate makes this a reality My concern increased when I saw the results of a freedom of information request by Migration Watch UK, which showed that just 2% of the thousands who have made their way to the UK in small boats across the channel are in possession of a passport.",3
"Between January 2018 and June 2021, there were 16,500 such arrivals, and only 317 were found to have a passport at the time of being processed in the UK.",3
"The fact is that by destroying their documents, migrants make it harder for the authorities to identify the claimant and assess their claim In responding to a similar amendment in Committee, the Minister, my noble friend Lord Wolfson of Tredegar, emphasised the case-by-case nature of decision-making, which I think was welcome to noble Lords.",3
"The lack of clarity is an invitation to the people smugglers to persist with their wicked advice, and their wicked and dangerous trade.",3
"I have not spoken up to this point, but I have been increasingly concerned about the effect of this particular legislative initiative and its potential impact on our reputation internationally, which had been very good in this area up to now, largely because of our role as one of the founding signatories of the refugee convention The present situation is one about which the Government are clearly not being frank with the public and the House.",3
"If we do break up families of asylum seekers or otherwise, we shall be acting completely outside the pale of civilised behaviour.",2
"That would be extremely worrying to an awful lot of us The Government are known, in international rumour, to be in negotiation with a number of African countries—Rwanda, for example—on establishing some sort of camp or facility to take failed asylum seekers from this country, but we do not know what the terms of such an arrangement would be.",4
People who have come in small boats and hidden in lorries have been accused of coming here illegally.,3
"The Government should think about setting up an office in, say, Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer so that there will be some direct contact with these potential illegal immigrants.",3
"My noble friend Lord Kirkhope is a former immigration Minister, who speaks with authority on this matter.",4
"Many years ago, after carefully examining this policy of offshoring, he rejected the proposal to offshore asylum seekers on the basis that it was impractical and ineffective.",3
Whose legal system would be used to assess asylum seekers that we have offshored—Britain’s or the third country’s?,4
"Once assessed, would these asylum seekers be returned to the UK?",3
Many refugees fleeing Ukraine may well attempt to come to the UK.,3
"Last Saturday evening, the Prime Minister clearly stated that we would welcome refugees from Ukraine here.",3
"By Sunday, that commitment had become that we would support refugees in neighbouring countries to Ukraine.",3
"Today, we can see that the approach has moved again and that the Government are committed to expanding their family visa scheme and introducing a new community sponsorship scheme for Ukrainians, both of which are significant and welcome steps.",3
"However, are we still saying that every other Ukrainian refugee who reaches these shores would fall into tier-2 status, have no recourse to public funds and be subject to potential offshoring?",3
"Instead of designing a structure that draws a proper distinction between economic and humanitarian motivations for migrants trying to reach our shores, it seems that the Government are muddying the water and resorting to this extraordinary measure of offshoring As we have learned more about the realities of life in the Australian processing centres, many noble Lords have become increasingly concerned by the reports of what children have been forced to endure.",3
"To stop this now and to exclude some aspects because there are unanswered questions at this stage, when the Government are clearly in negotiations on this—they are half way or quarter way through the process; I do not know—would be foolish in the interests of looking at the whole picture Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, often makes the point that this aspect of asylum seekers and refugees coming across the channel is only a small part of a much larger picture of migration; I think he used the figure that asylum seekers make up 6% of those coming over.",3
"Obviously, we all hope that no Ukrainian has to find a way across the channel via a smuggler.",3
"As I understand it, the Prime Minister said at Question Time today that he had been in discussions with the Poles, for example, about how Britain could help the Polish Government to deal with the massive influx they have had over their borders.",3
"I was just trying to be helpful In terms of these amendments, I will remind noble Lords from the outset that changes within Clause 28 via the schedule do not enable overseas asylum processing.",3
"On the face of the Bill, we set out the requirements a state must meet for us to remove a person with a pending asylum claim there I turn now to the amendments.",3
"The second supports our future objective of enabling asylum processing overseas by making it possible to remove someone overseas while their asylum claim is pending and without having to issue a certificate under the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.)",3
"It will also make changes to simplify the current legislative drafting in relation to asylum claim appeals, although the effect remains the same: an individual has no right of appeal against the decision that removal to the specified countries would not breach the UK’s obligations under the refugee convention.",3
"I cannot support Amendments 36 and 39 which, perhaps unintentionally, block these important improvements to our ability to swiftly remove individuals who have no basis to remain in the UK As I made clear in Committee, we are currently undertaking discussions with like-minded partners which seek to establish overseas asylum processing.",3
"We are committed to ensuring that overseas asylum processing is both humane and safe, taking into account circumstances which may mean that overseas processing is not appropriate for particular individuals For far too long, we have allowed people smugglers to decide where and how people cross borders and claim asylum.",3
The key aim of the Government is to destroy the business model of the people smugglers.,2
One facet of achieving this is to reduce demand for smugglers’ services by making it easier to remove individuals who undertake dangerous journeys or otherwise abuse the asylum system.,3
"Since then, there has not been a single irregular maritime arrival on Australia’s shores, as far as we can tell.” The high commissioner stated that the most important thing was to “drive the people smugglers out of business by depriving them of a product to sell and destroying their cash flow.”—[Official Report, Commons, Nationality and Borders Bill Committee, 23/9/21; cols.",3
"That is a very clear message, and it is precisely what the new plan for immigration is designed to do The agreements that we are pursuing will have these principles at their core.",3
"We are working to establish an effective, functioning system which provides protection to those in need while simultaneously preventing abuse Noble Lords will want to know who will be removed overseas for asylum processing and who will be exempted from this.",3
"Some noble Lords have already referred to the fact that, in the other place, my right honourable friend Minister Pursglove made clear that unaccompanied asylum-seeking children would not have their claims processed overseas.",3
"More importantly, however, being definitive about exemptions from the policy at this stage is likely to hamper its potential to be effective and would incentivise people smugglers to target the most vulnerable in the hopes of keeping their operations viable.",3
"In fact, the more difficult the Government make it for genuine refugees to get to the UK, the more that people will have to rely on people smugglers and the more profit that people smugglers will make Amendment 52 would require the Government to keep Parliament informed every three months on the progress they are making to increase security co-operation to prevent people smuggling, increase prosecutions of people smugglers both in the UK and overseas, and the steps they are taking to prevent or deter people from charging refugees to help or purporting to help them to get to the UK and endangering their safety.",3
"No doubt the Government will say they do not want to give details of the actions they are taking, as this may give the people smugglers an advantage, but we need to hold the Government to account to keep the pressure on them to do all they can to stop this evil exploitation of the vulnerable Amendment 61, which we also support, would make it an offence for people smugglers to advertise their services.",3
"Amendment 59 would ensure that those genuinely helping an asylum seeker, such as someone sailing a yacht in the channel who comes across a sinking dinghy full of asylum seekers, cannot be prosecuted by maintaining the status quo where such a prosecution could take place only if the person was helping asylum seekers for gain The Bill seeks to limit sea rescue to those co-ordinated by HM Coastguard or the equivalent, but they may not always be involved, especially in what could be the vital initial stages of a rescue.",3
"The Bill should focus on people smugglers, and not place good Samaritans at risk of prosecution Finally, Amendments 62 and 63 try to ensure that lives are not put at risk from those involved in law enforcement pushing back refugee boats.",3
The Government and the Bill should target the people smugglers while doing everything they can to protect the lives of the vulnerable.,3
"I am glad to be able to talk about this topic, because it is at the heart of the many problems in this area The UK takes smuggling and irregular migration seriously and is absolutely committed to tackling organised immigration crime in all its forms.",4
"To tackle the threat, we have in place a multi-agency organised immigration crime task force that brings together law enforcement, border guards, immigration officials and prosecutors, to tackle organised crime groups involved in people smuggling.",3
"We are committed to working with France to maintain the security of our shared border, and to tackle illegal migration, and this relationship is long-standing, supported by the Sandhurst Treaty.",3
"The UK pledged to make a further financial investment of approximately £54 million in 2021-22 to tackle illegal migration in small boats, and last year’s investment saw the French doubling the number of officers patrolling the beaches In and beyond Europe, we are working to exchange existing capability and co-operation internationally to disrupt organised criminal gangs and dangerous people smuggling routes.",3
"The joint political declaration between the EU and the UK, agreed in December 2020, noted the importance of good management of migratory flows, and the UK’s intention to engage in bilateral discussions with the most concerned member states to discuss suitable practical arrangements, including on asylum and illegal migration We maintain frequent contact with law enforcement partners both in the UK and abroad as part of our investigations into people smugglers, and these are often highly sensitive and complex.",3
I am sure that noble Lords understand that Addressing the organised crime groups that facilitate illegal migration remains a UK priority.,3
"Last year, over 23,000 crossing attempts were prevented by French law enforcement and, since the UK-France JIC has been established, we have with France dismantled 19 small-boat organised criminal groups and secured over 400 arrests—quite often the things that people do not hear about I would like to stress again that the UK already has a number of safe and legal routes in place, and those in need of protection should claim asylum in the first safe country that they reach, rather than paying those smugglers for dangerous journeys with risk to life.",4
All countries have a moral responsibility to tackle the issue of illegal migration and it is fundamental that our international partners engage with us to enhance our current co-operation.,2
"In fact, it might hinder or stall the fruitful and open dialogue on these issues between the UK and its international partners, many of whom would not agree to their discussions and domestic activity aimed at reducing people smuggling being published to a domestic audience In summary, I cannot support the amendment, because it is not appropriate to provide a running commentary on the actions that are being taken to tackle people smugglers, and I am sure that the noble Lord knows that.",3
"Much of it is sensitive activity, operational and based on intelligence sharing, with the aim of protecting vulnerable people Turning now to Amendment 59, our purpose in removing mandatory proof of gain from this offence is to more readily target people smugglers, where organised crime gangs will conceal their tracks and make it as difficult as possible to prove that they are getting financial gain to the standard required for a successful prosecution Let me provide an example.",3
A suspected facilitator was detected at Heathrow Airport with passports concealed on his person and in his baggage.,3
"A short time later, an undocumented female of the same nationality and coming off the same flight claimed asylum.",3
Her appearance matched that of the image on one of the concealed passports.,3
"Despite the strong circumstantial evidence, it could not be established that the money was directly linked to the female asylum seeker’s facilitation and so, without being able to prove “for gain”, the prosecution could not proceed.",3
"This is a fundamental change to immigration law that many of us are worried will criminalise asylum, full stop.",2
"One can only imagine what effect a similar law would have in Poland now, with people fleeing across the border.",3
"The fact is, however, that the Bill changes the offence from entering to arriving, which raises serious issues and has serious consequences for us all For example, aside from those seeking asylum, would this provision apply to a person who arrives in the UK with the wrong paperwork?",3
"I have guidance that the CPS has announced, in consultation with the National Crime Agency, the Home Office and the police, which says that those seeking asylum should not be prosecuted under existing offences of entering the UK illegally.",3
"That is in recognition of the fact that it is not in the public interest, and that asylum seekers “often have no choice in how they travel and face exploitation by organised crime groups” That is in a press statement from the CPS.",3
"Similarly, the Government’s answer has been that the powers will be used in only exceptional and limited circumstances, such as where a person has breached a deportation order—in which case, we should pass a power for those circumstances It is not right to ask the House to pass these powers —on the basis that the Government’s own agencies say that they will not use them—or to criminalise a person who arrives in the UK to ask for asylum from war and persecution.",3
"It is late, but this change in the offence will have serious consequences for the way our asylum and refugee system works.",3
It criminalises and treats genuine refugees as second class if they arrive via a so-called safe third country.,2
"Also, this clause potentially criminalises everyone who arrives in the UK to claim asylum even when they have flown directly to the UK.",3
"It effectively criminalises all asylum seekers arriving in the UK unless they have been resettled through a government scheme—resettlement schemes that range from few and far between to non-existent From what the Minister said in Committee, I understand that the idea of the clause was to ensure that migrants crossing the channel in small boats who were rescued and brought to the UK could still be prosecuted, even though they had arrived legally.",3
"Someone who secures a visitor visa, for example, flies non-stop to the UK and claims asylum at the UK border would be guilty of an offence because their entry clearance was only to visit, not to claim asylum and stay permanently.",3
The definition in Section 11 of the Immigration Act 1971 concerning entry is based on assumptions that no longer address the methods that have emerged for migrants to evade our border controls It might help if I explained the effect of the amendment and the consequence of not getting it right.,3
I remind the House that the Court of Appeal has held that an asylum seeker who merely attempts to arrive at the frontiers of the United Kingdom to make a claim is not entering or attempting to enter the country unlawfully in accordance with the definition of “entry” in Section 11.,3
This means that individuals who step foot in the UK because their small boat was rescued by Border Force do not “enter” the UK in the technical sense.,3
"Where there is no unlawful entry or attempt at entry, the unscrupulous people smugglers sending people across the channel in unseaworthy vessels that require rescue cannot be held to account for facilitating a breach of immigration law Amending these offences to refer to “enters” rather than “arrives in” renders them unworkable.",3
"It encourages individuals to unnecessarily endanger themselves and others by travelling in small craft wholly unsuitable for the crossing If there is no offence of illegal arrival and if, as proposed in Amendment 58, this is not added as a breach of immigration law for the facilitation offence, then we will have practically eroded our ability to prosecute any people smugglers who are involved in risking migrants’ lives by putting them into small inadequate boats.",3
An MOU between immigration and the CPS has been updated and will be published.,3
"My Lords, Amendment 58A, in my name and those of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London, the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, and the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, would require the Secretary of State to prohibit the automatic sharing of the personal data of a victim of or witness to crime for immigration purposes This is a familiar issue to the House.",3
"It was a key issue raised in the Domestic Abuse Bill, when your Lordships voted to provide safe reporting for migrant victims of domestic abuse.",3
"In this Bill, this issue has been raised in particular due to the offence of arriving into the UK proposed in Clause 39 The question I asked in Committee was: if a person is trafficked into the UK, is it the first duty of the police to recognise them as a victim of trafficking or as a criminal under Clause 39?",3
"What is practically being done to build that trust Rather than full safe reporting, the Government have opted for an immigration enforcement victims protocol, which they state will prevent enforcement action against victims while criminal investigations and proceedings are ongoing, and while the victim is being supported Organisations working on the ground with victims have raised that the protocol will not make victims feel safe to report offences, so it fails that first hurdle.",3
"In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, asked the Government to check whether it remains the case that one in two victims does not report crimes to the police for fear of disbelief and deportation.",3
"However, I am of Irish stock, and I wear that complementary characteristic with great pride also, and this year I will take delivery of my Irish passport to underscore that I will not be stripped of my European citizenship, and I will also get through the airport quicker My family hail from Donegal, Ireland’s premier and most picturesque county with the tallest mountains, the finest golden beaches, the sweetest turf smoke and the wettest bogs.",3
"As kids and young adults, we were repeatedly told, “You have the ability.” This immigrant ideology of ambition and betterment is not unique to the Irish diaspora—far from it—but it stood generations of us, the product of Irish immigration, in good stead Slightly contradictory, however, was the equal but opposite message that we also got from our parents, which was, “Don’t get too big for your boots or somebody will cut you down to size”—life could often be complex at home.",3
A lot of this legislation is cruel and uses new definitions for things that we thought were settled some time ago These regulations seem to be deliberately drafted to disregard the international norms around slavery and trafficking; they create special UK definitions that limit government assistance to a narrow category of survivors.,3
"I do not understand why any Government would do this to people who have been trafficked In my view, the Government do not want to help enslaved people; they simply want to label these people as illegal immigrants or economic migrants and deport them as fast as possible.",3
I think the problem here is that the Government do not actually intend to support all victims of slavery and human trafficking and I think that diminishes us as a nation.,2
If residents cannot prove this before 30 July they will be declared illegal immigrants.,3
"The very serious concern is that, as was the case with the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, this could lead to millions of impoverished Muslims being stripped of their citizenship and deported—or even worse.",3
May I commend the Home Secretary for her response to the Windrush scandal but press her on the separate issue of illegal immigration?,3
"Press reports this week show that 27,000 illegal immigrants have been arrested by 28 forces in the past four years.",3
Why is it being left to the police to arrest illegal immigrants?,2
Why are they not being stopped at the border?,3
"I beg to move, That leave be given to bring in a Bill to allow persons descended from individuals born in the British Indian Ocean Territory to register as British overseas territories citizens; and for connected purposes This Bill will allow individuals descended from the Chagos Islands to register as British citizens in recognition of the fact that their parents and grandparents were forcibly exiled from that UK overseas territory.",3
"We cannot change history, but we can support those removed from their homeland and their descendants who are not covered by the existing law and protections that, as Britons, they should enjoy The legislation currently assumes that just one generation of Chagossians will be born in exile and, although many members of the community born in exile have received British citizenship, their children have not.",3
"As such, when these families have come to the UK, as is their right, their children have been treated as immigrants like any others by the Home Office.",4
"Of course, had the population not been evicted half a century ago, all born on the islands would already have British citizenship status Crawley is home to perhaps the largest Chagossian population in the world, and it is my privilege to stand up for that community in Parliament and locally.",3
The Bill would simplify nationality law so that anyone who can prove that they are of Chagossian descent becomes eligible to register as a British overseas territories citizen I continue to support the right of return of the Chagossian people.,3
I am sure that all in this House would agree with the salience of such values forming a vital part of our foreign policy.,3
But our nation’s treatment of the Chagossian people is a blight on our country’s conscience—one that we can start to put right by helping these Britons all to become British overseas territories citizens.,3
The consequences of mass uncontrolled immigration are one of the most serious challenges confronting Europe today.,2
"The problem is felt especially acutely by countries on the Mediterranean and the Aegean, which are often where migrants first arrive, but this is a shared challenge, which affects us all.",2
"More than anything, the situation is a tragedy for the migrants themselves, thousands of whom have now lost their lives.",2
"This includes providing more opportunities in the countries where economic migrants are coming from, and helping to ensure that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country that they reach.",3
"Alongside our economic development and humanitarian support, we have also been stepping up our communications effort upstream so that more potential migrants understand the grave dangers of the journeys they might undertake and the criminal people smugglers who are waiting to exploit them Secondly, there will be more work to distinguish between genuine refugees and illegal economic migrants.",3
"There is clearly much more work to be done, with the support of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration, to establish whether such proposals are practically and legally viable, but we do need to be prepared to look again at new solutions, given the gravity and intractability of this challenge Thirdly, there will be further efforts to strengthen borders to help to prevent illegal migration.",3
The UK now has law enforcement officers in 17 EU and African countries as part of our organised immigration crime taskforce.,3
UK and French officers are also working together to build links between counter-trafficking agencies in Nigeria and Niger to strengthen this key border on the central route.,3
"In the context of online threats from the full range of state and non-state actors, President Macron and I joined together in pushing for further action to tackle illegal online content, especially terrorist content Finally, on security, we looked ahead to our NATO summit next week, which will be an important moment to demonstrate western unity.",3
"We have put forward proposals and will produce further proposals so that if a temporary backstop is needed, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.",3
"We are absolutely committed to the avoidance of such a border, and we are equally committed to the avoidance of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.",3
Northern Ireland is an integral part of our country and we will never accept the imposition of a border within our United Kingdom We all agreed that we must now urgently intensify and accelerate the pace of negotiations on our future relationship.,3
I hope that the whole House shares my concern about the direction in which those on the hard right seem determined to take Europe’s migration and asylum policy.,3
There was evidence of that only a few weeks ago when the new Italian Interior Minister exploited the plight of 600 migrant refugees on the rescue ship Aquarius to make a callous political point.,3
"That incident has made it clear that, more than ever, we need strong leadership across Europe to uphold the right to asylum and treat all migrants with dignity and respect.",3
It is right that EU countries should help migrants rescued in the Mediterranean and also take action to alleviate the burden on Italy and Greece.,3
"Even the NHS is now having to plan for multiple scenarios because there is no clarity from Government Secondly, how do the Government intend to prevent a hard border in Ireland if we are not in a customs union?",3
"The question is quite simply: does she want a close trading relationship with the EU, with aligned rights and regulations, or does she believe in the visions of those on her Benches who see Britain’s future as a low-regulated, low-investment tax haven Fourthly, will potential options for Britain’s future immigration policy be included in the Brexit White Paper?",3
Gentleman talked about the right to claim asylum.,3
"In 2016, when I went to the United Nations, I set out the three principles that we believe underlie these issues: first, that people should claim asylum in the first safe country that they come to; secondly, that it should be possible to differentiate better between economic migrants and refugees, which I think will enable more support to be available for refugees; and thirdly, that countries have a right to be able to defend their borders, but they must also accept returns of those individuals who have gone illegally elsewhere and should be returned to those countries The right hon.",3
"In particular, we have had Border Force staff working in Greece to help in terms of the processes there for claiming asylum and identifying refugees and others.",3
"We have been working similarly in Italy, but also working, as I indicated in my statement in relation to the organised immigration crime taskforce, to ensure that we are identifying the people smugglers who are the people behind the misery that so many individual migrants find themselves subjected to These people smugglers have no care for the humanity—for the lives—of the people that they are dealing with; they are quite happy to put them into boats that they know will sink and send them off from the Libyan coast.",3
"Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes)—my dear friend—for initiating the debate, and for giving Parliament a moment to reflect on a most exceptional generation Today I want to remember the contributions of the 492 West Indian immigrants who arrived at Tilbury docks on 21 June 1948, and the 524,000 Commonwealth-born people who followed them until 1971.",3
"My father was only 24, and he was actually at the older end of the scale among those who were on the boats.",3
"I hope that we also think about the first-generation immigrants who still come to our country, of how they manage to get by, and of the circumstances in which we support them Today, of course, I also want to think about the thousands of nurses who came to Britain before 1971, to form the backbone of our national health service—women like my aunts, whom I watched working late nights and early shifts with incredible pride and dignity; women who toiled for all Britain’s sick and injured.",3
"Like in Britain after the second world war, the homes of those on board the Windrush and the many boats that came after it had also been destroyed by a foreign power—a foreign power had left much of the Caribbean in a sorry state.",3
"The story began in the 1700s and today, most painfully, we have been forced back across the Atlantic by the British Government in unlawful deportations justified by the “hostile environment.” That environment told Windrush citizens that they have no right to the British public services to which so many of them had dedicated their lives and to which their ancestors had contributed.",4
"Seventy years on, the Government thanked the Windrush generation for their service to this country by throwing them into detention centres and deporting them Those victims have still not seen justice, and the Government’s response to the crisis continues to be inadequate.",3
Why have 32 of the 63 Windrush citizens unlawfully deported as a result of the Government’s hostile environment policy been refused their right to return to Britain?,3
"He is a citizen by right, but for all of his life he has lived in fear of immigration enforcement and has been unable to get a job, access benefits or even have a stable home.",3
"Why are hundreds of victims who have contacted the taskforce regarding their citizenship still waiting for an appointment at the Home Office Above all, today I think of the victims of this crisis, victims who are still facing desperate uncertainty, and the Government’s subsequent response.",3
"I think of Oliver Hutchinson; of Balvin Marshall, a British citizen made homeless and jobless by the hostile environment; of Rosario Wilson, whose grandfather arrived in Britain in the 1950s and who has spent thousands of pounds trying to prove his citizenship; and of my 27 constituents with ongoing cases and the thousands of other Commonwealth-born Britons who live in fear and uncertainty I say to the Secretary of State, who has said of those Windrush citizens with criminal records who have been sent back to the Caribbean that he has no intention of bringing them back, that that is unacceptable.",3
This country has had no such debate on the deportation of criminals.,3
This country stopped deporting criminals to parts of the Australian Commonwealth in 1868.,3
"How can it be that, with no debate and no discussion, it has been deemed acceptable once again to deport British citizens, even if they have a criminal record, back to the Commonwealth Can I say how badly this has gone down in the broader Commonwealth and how sad and embarrassing it was that we had this discussion and this debate during the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting?",3
"Many of those people, however, are experiencing difficulties because the immigration department is saying that the immigration position of their parents and grandparents was not resolved Now, sadly, I turn to what happened to that Windrush generation after a lifetime of working hard, paying their taxes, bringing up their families, and contributing to a strong and stable society.",3
"The Home Secretary says that 63 people have been deported, but the final total could be much higher.",3
Our own citizens were deported We also still have no information on how many of the Windrush generation have been wrongly detained at immigration detention centres.,3
"They admit that some people have been excluded—prevented from returning to their homes and families when they had just been on an overseas trip, perhaps for a wedding, a funeral or a family holiday.",3
"All too often when we debate the Windrush generation, Conservative Members start talking about illegal migrants, and some of us think it is wrong to talk about the Windrush generation and illegal migrants in the same breath.",3
Let me say this very slowly for Members who refuse to accept it: the Windrush generation was not illegal.,3
The whole problem of the Windrush scandal is that those who were legally here were treated as if they were illegal.,2
There is a reason why they were treated as if they were illegal.,3
"I have news for Members opposite: the Labour party is under new management, and they will not hear from the current leadership some of the things they heard in the past about migration A whole string of non-expert agents, landlords, employers, NHS staff and others have been asked to identify people they suspect of being illegal immigrants.",3
"That is an excellent point, and many of the Windrush generation people I have met or tried to help have been completely frustrated by the fact that they had a whole ream of paper showing that they had been paying tax for all these years, but still the Home Office rejected their claim that they had been legally here I am afraid to say that this is a product of a system put in place by this Government, and if anyone doubts that, they have to answer this question: who was it who said we would deport first and ask questions later?",3
"Was that not announcing in advance that people who were entitled to be here may well be deported and treated as if they were here illegally, and then they could appeal?",3
"Of course, it was the Prime Minister who said we would deport first and have appeals later.",3
"She was warned: I warned her here in this Chamber when we debated the Immigration Act 2014 that the consequence of an Act designed to catch illegal immigrants in its net would be that people who just looked like immigrants would be caught up, and that is what we are seeing with the Windrush scandal Looking ahead, the new Home Secretary clearly does not want to go the way of his predecessor, and he clearly wants to put the scandal behind him, but it is a product of policy, not accidents, and that policy will continue to generate scandals for the waves of migrants who came after 1948, all the way up to 1973, and it will draw in broader and broader categories of people from the Commonwealth.",3
"Others just wanted new and more prosperous lives for themselves and their families, and they were what are now sometimes called economic migrants.",3
There is an unfortunate history in this country of sometimes defaulting to seeing categories of good immigrants and bad immigrants.,3
"For a long time, anyone from the Caribbean tended to be treated as a bad immigrant, with all the stereotypes that were ascribed to black Britons.",3
I have met members of the Windrush generation who have had to live off the charity of friends and family and who have run up debts because of all the uncertainty about their immigration situation.,3
"The Windrush generation has had a number of important effects, but none has been more important than forcing people to look at migrants as people—people with families, people with histories and people just like other people.",3
"If we could only extend the humanisation of the debate on migration from the Windrush generation to migrants of all generations and all times, we would achieve what I am committed to seeing—namely, a very different type of conversation on migration.",3
It should not have to take 60 years for people to recognise the contribution of a group of migrants to this country.,3
"My constituency is rich in immigrants who make our community richer, and not just financially—we welcome them.",3
"That means less cash for public services, and the situation is made worse by the Government’s other policies on immigration, with 2,500 doctors refused visas in the first five months of this year.",3
"That is why the Lord Dubs amendment—it is being debated today—on the rights of unaccompanied minors and child refugees, the most vulnerable in society, is so important Scotland voted to remain, and we know that every Brexit scenario is damaging.",3
"My Lords, as one of the several Members of this House who recommended the establishment of a committee on citizenship, I would like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, and all members of the committee for producing an excellent report that deserves to spark off further discussion.",3
"I hope they will all, with us, continue to make the argument that citizenship as a concept is fundamental to a healthy democracy We are talking about citizenship, civic engagement and self-government.",3
"It is partly that the concepts of citizenship and the welfare state grew up at a time when the state wanted its citizens to provide national service in the military sense before the First World War and, of course, during and after the Second World War.",3
"Efforts to shrink the state and the services it provides have left many outside alienated and embittered, with results that we saw in the anti-politics that supported UKIP and Vote Leave Government has been retreating from the provision of social welfare, which began in the years before the First World War.",3
"The libertarian view, current within the present Government, that the state should no longer provide services from general taxation and should retreat from fiscal redistribution from rich to poor and from wealthy regions to deprived ones weakens the whole concept of citizenship.",3
"The problem of the “left behind”—the white working class that those of us who live in former industrial cities are painfully aware of—is not just one of social integration of recent immigrants; it is a matter of social inclusion of people who feel that they are entitled to be regarded as having rights as citizens of our country but feel that they no longer receive them The report talks in its first paragraph of an environment, “in which everyone feels a sense of belonging to the country of which they are a citizen, with a stake in it and a responsibility towards it” It then goes on to note that: “Active citizenship is too often defined purely in terms of volunteering ... and too rarely in terms of ... practising democracy”— that is, that democratic rights and democratic participation are a very important part of the concept.",3
"Therefore, part of the problem of citizenship and democracy is that the local is far too weak.",2
"As we know, all politics is local, and the revival of local democracy is essential to recreating the sense of belonging which is part of shared citizenship There is some excellent stuff on citizenship education.",3
The evidence we have received for this debate from Young Citizens says that almost the entire support structure for citizenship education has been dismantled.,3
We have to go on insisting that citizenship education is a vital part of education for life.,2
"After all, citizenship should promote a sense of a shared national community, and we need to think about how well we do that Lastly, I want to flag the section on the costs of citizenship, which raises wider questions.",3
"With another hat on, I have been much concerned at reports from the academic sector about the extent to which the costs of establishing residence—and even more so of establishing citizenship—deter academics and researchers from other countries from coming to Britain, let alone staying in Britain.",3
"He was an exceptional chair and, partly because of that, the report is strong and bold and deserving of everyone’s consideration One of the strange things about this issue of citizenship and civic education is that no one is against it.",3
"Nobody in the 21st century will stand up and say, “I am against citizenship and against civic engagement”.",3
We can all see some immigrants who have made good and done well in this country.,3
"Had they made a cogent case in their response for not adopting our proposals, I would have felt a bit better, but they did not The same trend could be seen in citizenship education.",3
Our children are not getting the sort of citizenship education in school today that they need and deserve and which we as a society need and deserve.,2
"Over the past eight years, where once we had 10,000 citizenship teachers, we now have fewer than 5,000.",3
None of that applies to citizenship and we cannot get away from that.,2
"I agree with my noble friend Lord Blunkett on this point: I am not against character education, but it is not citizenship education, which has been squeezed out over the past few years.",3
That needs to be remedied My final point is the cost of applying for citizenship.,2
I was lucky enough to be part of the Committee which witnessed a citizenship ceremony held at Westminster City Hall.,3
"It was a wonderful experience to watch people take on their citizenship, but when we spoke to them afterwards, it was the cost that they wanted to talk about.",3
The cost to the family purse of taking on citizenship almost spoilt the day for them.,3
"To justify not reducing the cost of acquiring citizenship, the Government talk about what they do with the profits they make.",3
"The response states: “A significant proportion of this contributes towards the cost of wider immigration functions; helping to protect and maintain effective core services” We should all be paying for those services, not just those who are seeking to become citizenships or acquiring visas.",3
"There is no justification for the core costs of our immigration services to be put on the backs of these people This is a good, bold and strong report.",3
There is no acknowledgement of the seriousness of the concerns we raise in relation to the citizenship challenge we identify.,3
"We found that, “what is missing is any clear, coherent or ambitious vision of why citizenship should matter in the UK in the 21st century”.",3
"I looked in vain for such a vision in the Government’s response The response summarised the overarching aim of our recommendations as, “simplifying the individual’s civic journey, and enabling people to be active citizens” Certainly, the civic journey and active citizenship were important threads in our argument, but our recommendations were aimed not at simplification but at removing what many witnesses identified as “barriers, blockages or obstacles”, particularly those faced by marginalised groups.",3
"As noble Lords have already heard, we saw citizenship education as a key building block.",3
"We were thus dismayed that the Government’s Integrated Communities Strategy Green Paper said nothing about it, thereby exemplifying the Government’s “clear lack of citizenship vision” I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Agnew, for meeting us to discuss our recommendations, but the Government’s complacent response—how many noble Lords have already used that adjective?—failed to match the urgency of our concern about the state of citizenship education, which we had been told was, “withering on the vine at the moment at a time when it is needed more than ever” Only one of our recommendations in this area was accepted, although as we have already heard, even this has not yet been actioned.",3
"Otherwise, it was warm words and Pollyanna-like claims, which are at odds with the alarming evidence we received of its “parlous state” The barriers to citizenship and to social integration through participation that we identified were various, including some rooted in socioeconomic disadvantage and other inequalities, such as gender.",3
A common message was that the ability to communicate in English is vital to British citizenship.,3
"While we noted that this is as true of those of the indigenous population, for whom functional illiteracy is a barrier as it is of migrants, our recommendations focused mainly on ESOL, which is of especial importance to refugees and to women, who face particular access problems because of their childcare responsibilities.",3
"I return like a broken record to an issue that has been exercising me and many others in recent months—the obstacles put in the way of children who, because of their parents’ immigration status, need to register their statutory entitlement to citizenship.",3
"One barrier identified in our report is the “good character” requirement for children from the age of only 10, which originally applied only to applications for naturalisation, in recognition of the important distinction between registration of citizenship and naturalisation.",3
"Whatever one thinks of such a low age of criminal responsibility, it surely cannot be right that according to a coalition of voluntary organisations—I declare an interest as recently becoming a patron of one of them—the requirement is used to prevent children registering rights to British citizenship, even where they have had only minimal contact with the criminal justice system, such as receiving a caution or a fine The Government also referred to their statutory obligation, “to have due regard to the best interests of the child”, but how can it be in the best interests of the child for their entitlement to citizenship to be denied on the basis of behaviour at such a young age?",3
"The committee questioned the “excessive profits” made on these and naturalisation fees, and in relation to children could see, “no ground for the Home Office charging more than the costs they incur” As we have heard, we made the case for waiving the citizenship registration fee altogether in the case of children in care and children who have spent their entire lives in the UK The Government’s response was—as always on this matter—totally unsatisfactory.",3
"Their justification that the exorbitant fees, “help fund and maintain effective wider immigration system functions”, in effect puts the best interests of the immigration system above the best interests of children—who in any case are not immigrants.",3
"Moreover, their oft-repeated argument: “Setting fees at above cost also enables the Home Office to exempt some people from having to pay a fee”, and, “to waive fees in certain individual circumstances”, is potentially misleading because it implies that such waivers can apply to the citizenship registration fee in question, which they cannot, as underlined by the noble Lord, Lord Russell One of the Government’s arguments in response to pressure on the level of the fee has been that citizenship is not really that important.",3
But the underlying premise of our report is that citizenship is important—it matters.,3
I hope that the Government will rethink their response to this and many of our other recommendations and come forward with a clear vision and strategy for citizenship to help unite our country at a time when it has perhaps never been more divided.,3
"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the UK’s future border and immigration system after we leave the EU We all heard the public’s concerns about immigration in the run-up to the EU referendum.",4
"As the son of immigrant parents, I know full well the contribution they, like many other migrants, made to the community I grew up in.",3
"We recognise and value the contribution of immigration and the contribution it has made to our society, our culture, our economy and our communities, and this cannot be over-stressed.",3
We will continue to welcome talented migrants from every corner of the globe.,3
"Deal or no deal, we want you to stay, and we will protect your rights.” The future system is about making sure immigration works in the best interests of the UK.",3
"We are simply making sure that we have control over who comes through them, ensuring, as we committed to do in our manifesto, that we are able to bring annual net migration down to more sustainable levels Today, we have published a White Paper setting out the Government’s proposals for doing this through a single, skills-based immigration system that will seize the unique opportunities enabled by the end of free movement.",3
"Tomorrow, we will introduce the immigration and social security co-ordination (EU withdrawal) Bill to implement this.",3
"It will make European economic area and Swiss nationals and their family members subject to UK immigration control, and it will protect the status of Irish nationals.",3
"This means that in the future everyone other than British and Irish citizens will need to get UK permission before they can come here Secondly, there will be a single immigration system for all nationalities.",3
"We believe this is fair, and it will help drive up wages and productivity across our economy Following these three principles, we are acting to make the future immigration system work for those coming to our country, for businesses, for our public services and for the UK as a whole.",3
"There will be no cap on numbers and no requirement for the highest skilled workers to undertake a resident labour market test, and there will be a minimum salary threshold We are also creating a time-limited short-term workers route to ensure businesses have the staff that they need to fill jobs, as they adapt to a new immigration system.",3
"This route will be open to seasonal and low-skilled workers, along with high-skilled workers who need to come to the UK for longer than the current business visitor visa rules allow.",3
"We will be engaging extensively with businesses and with stakeholders on the length of the stay and the cooling-off period to make sure that we get this right These proposals will give protection to British workers, but we have recognised that immigration alone cannot be the solution, so we will continue as a Government, working in partnership with business, to invest in and to improve the productivity and skills of the UK workforce Our world-class universities will also benefit from the proposed new system.",3
The future immigration system will be quick and easy to use.,3
This will improve the experience visitors and travellers have when they are crossing the border.,3
"At the same time, we will improve security at the border by introducing an electronic travel authorisation scheme and phasing out the use of insecure national identity cards We are proposing a single, skills-based immigration system that will be fit for the future—one that is flexible to accommodate the trade deals that we agree with the EU and with other countries.",3
This means that individuals do not need to make immediate changes and that businesses do not need to rush through plans based on guesswork about the future system The immigration White Paper outlines the proposals for the biggest change to our immigration system in a generation.,3
"However, it is important to note that it is not the final word; rather, it is the starting point of a national conversation on a future immigration system.",3
"I am pleased to announce that the Government will be launching a year-long programme of engagement across the UK to ensure that a wide range of views are heard I am confident all the measures that have been outlined today will ensure that the UK continues to flourish outside the EU; that the future immigration system is geared towards controlling who can come here and for what purpose, reducing net migration, while ensuring the brightest and the best can work and study here; and that it will boost our economy and benefit the British people.",3
"We are building a fair and sustainable immigration system that answers the concerns people have rightly had about free movement—an immigration system that is designed in Britain, made in Britain and serves our national interest.",3
"My Lords, this debate in a sense has three dimensions: one is to discuss the transformed security environment in which we see ourselves; the second is the transformed position of the UK in the world; and the third is the appropriate response I note that the first report of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy, published last month, refers to, “major changes to the wider security environment (including the election of the Trump Administration … and the UK’s decision to leave the European Union); intensifying and diversifying threats to the UK’s security” The National Security Adviser told the committee that leaving the EU means that, “the UK is now working in a ‘different context’ on foreign and security policy matters” The committee quotes Sir John Sawers, a former National Security Adviser, in an interview with Prospect magazine, concluding that the combined effect of an erratic and distracted Washington and withdrawing from the EU required a major reformulation of the UK’s role in the world.",3
"A Britain without a major strategic anchor in the world” The report goes on to note the deteriorating situation in the Middle East, the rising asymmetric threats from Russia and the increasingly assertive nature of Chinese foreign and security policy, as well as rising cyber criminal and terrorist threats.",3
"It could have noted also the long-term threat of disorder and conflict in Africa, combined with the continuing population increase on that continent, leading to an uncontrollable flow of refugees and migrants northwards across the Mediterranean.",3
"That represents the real long-term threat of immigration, not the prospect of a limited increase in Poles and Romanians coming to Britain The Government’s answer to calls for a new international strategy to fit the changing international context has been to talk about a “global Britain”.",3
"Yesterday, we heard the Secretary of State for Transport telling us that there will be absolutely no problems in border control and so on when we leave the European Union because it was so clearly in the interest of those on the continent to maintain open borders with the UK.",3
"The Prime Minister herself talks about the importance of the Commonwealth, while the British Government do their best to deport long-term Commonwealth residents How does the concept of a global Britain apply to the Middle East, given the multiple conflicts and challenges in that region?",3
"Britain will be apart; we will be absent Geoffrey Howe, a foreign secretary of an entirely different quality from the present incumbent of that post, used to speak about the sharing of sovereignty, rather than the assertion of exceptional sovereignty.",3
"That is something that we on these Benches entirely and strongly support, although we are not entirely sure that such a position is consistent with the rejection of participation in our regional international order and with the particular objection that so many Conservatives appear to have to the regional rule of law, as represented by the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice Withdrawal from the European Union’s well-developed structures for co-ordinating foreign policy, defence policy and intelligence will weaken Britain’s robust international partnerships.",3
"I think there are 40 working groups in the common foreign policy and security network, which we will no longer be part of.",3
Do the Government begin to see the need for a new treaty to ensure that in foreign policy and security we will continue to co-operate?,3
"He will be aware that all our constituents, including those of immigrant descent, want an immigration system that is robust, but they also want it to be fair.",3
The widespread public response to the Windrush scandal tells us how seriously the general public take the question of fairness in our immigration system We now know from the Home Secretary’s statement that the mandatory provision of DNA was neither legal nor fair.,3
"Can he therefore clarify that the demand for DNA evidence was, in itself, illegal, and if so, what legal consequences will follow?",3
"Ministers must clarify how long this practice has been taking place, and under what internal Home Office regime it was allowed or encouraged and at what level The Home Secretary spoke about reviewing the current structure and processes of our immigration system, which I welcome.",3
"He will be aware that the Law Society has said that there are serious flaws in the immigration system, and one indicator of those flaws is the state of appeals.",3
Waiting times for immigration appeals have risen by 45%.,3
"The Home Secretary talks about independent oversight, but what more effective oversight is there than a system of appeals that is speedy and that works Finally, I remind the Home Secretary that the visa and immigration service faces what will possibly be the biggest single influx of applications in its history when EU nationals who live in the UK seek to settle their status post Brexit.",3
"It seems to me, as we are discussing the rights of European citizenship, that we should all declare our financial interests, as well as many more interests The concept of European citizenship was introduced in the 1992 Maastricht treaty, affording rights, freedoms and legal protections to all citizens, as well as giving a legal basis to European identity.",4
"European citizens are free to trade and transport goods, services and capital through EU borders as in national markets, with no restrictions on capital movements or duty fees.",4
"Finally, EU citizens enjoy legal protections under EU law, specifically through the charter of fundamental rights of the European Union and through Acts and directives regarding the protection of personal data, the rights of victims of crime, the prevention and combating of trafficking in human beings, equal pay and protection from employment discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, sexual orientation, age and other characteristics.",4
"I was never treated as an outsider or a foreigner, and none of the people I met during that time were ever foreign to me As an honorary consul, I have helped Romanian citizens in the highlands and islands, directing them to the support and services they might need.",4
"When we speak to and get to know refugees, what we learn can seem almost mundane, given the big picture we are trying to sort out legally, but when we drill down to the personal level, we see that people are not sleeping at night due to fear and worry.",3
"Their fear might not even be for themselves; it might, as I know from one case, be fear for a sister in a refugee camp in Sudan.",3
"The fear is of the sister being so desperate in the refugee camp that she will jump from that frying pan into a very horrible fire I have talked about my private Member’s Bill and what an independent Scotland would do, but I hope the Government will take these matters forward in an immigration Bill.",3
I know that an immigration Bill is coming.,3
"If we could now also sort out the issue of work visas for crews of fishing boats on the west coast of Scotland, that would be fantastic.",3
"Interestingly, these migrant workers would not be included in the migration figures, and boats would be back fishing and there would be processing going on.",3
"When working with refugees we become aware of many things, and the point made by the hon.",3
"Member for Liverpool, Riverside that I mentioned earlier was very valid: the public are absolutely onside when politicians are courageous enough to make a case, and do not run for the quick populist hit of just talking numbers, but instead start talking about human beings I am coming to the end of my remarks, but I want to give the final word to a refugee who recited a poem last night at Speaker’s House.",3
He was fantastic at communicating his issues among the other refugees I met in Speaker’s House last night.,3
Some of them consider themselves to have been refugees all their lives.,3
"I have tried to think of “refugee” as a temporary status before the person becomes a welder—like Yohannes from Canterbury, whom we spoke of on 16 March—a doctor or another productive member of society I met a woman from Somalia who, although she was a refugee, dreamed of going home.",3
"People in Gaelic Scotland—probably also in Wales and, indeed, in England—are pleased when migrants go off to countries such as Australia and New Zealand and maintain their language skills.",3
"If we want that as a set of values for ourselves, surely we could allow, enable and help refugees to maintain their culture and language.",3
"Wearing my Chair of the International Trade Committee cap, it is important that we have such skills in the UK going forward, so that when those countries become more prosperous and trade with us, we can trade with them using citizens who still have those language skills I want to indulge the House awhile with J. J. Bola’s poem from last night because—with the greatest of respect to today’s speakers—he puts into words what it is like to be a refugee much better than any Member here today could and certainly better than I could.",3
"He asked me to point out that he was a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the dictatorship has led to 6 million people being killed and many more displaced.",3
everything was foreign unfamiliar.,3
they called us refugees so we hid ourselves in their language until we sounded just like them.,3
"i told them that a refugee is simply someone who is trying to make a home so next time when you go home, tuck your children in and kiss your families goodnight be glad that the monsters never came for you in their suits and ties never came for you in the newspapers with the media lies never came for you that you are not despised and know that deep inside the hearts of each and every one of us we are all always reaching for a place that we can call home.”",3
"The subject is important all over the world—in Germany, in Italy and in the US—and I welcome President Trump’s decision to change course on the policy of separating children from their families at the border.",3
I meet many of them because Kennedy House in Wigston in my constituency is a centre for people seeking asylum and new refugees.,3
"I pay tribute to those who volunteer with those people, helping them to integrate into our community and in other practical ways.",3
"I also pay tribute to the groups, such as Market Harborough Helping Refugees, that raise funds to help refugees in this country and overseas with practical things such as blankets to help them as they seek a new home.",3
"Today’s debate is about the importance of family reunion but before I turn to that, this being Refugee Week, I hope the House will not mind me briefly mentioning a few things that we could do to improve the lives of refugees.",3
"I have three suggestions that have sprung from the work done by the all-party parliamentary group on loneliness, of which I am a member, and from my constituency experiences The first thing that the Government should do is clarify the rules on refugees and asylum seekers doing voluntary work in the community.",3
"I understand the arguments against allowing asylum seekers to do paid work and the arguments about pull factors, but they should be able to do voluntary work.",3
"By doing such work, they can express their strong desire to do something helpful for the community that is hosting them, but they can also integrate and learn English, so it can play an important role in them becoming part of our country.",4
"Unfortunately, refugee charities tell me that the rules are not clear and that people have lost out as a result of doing voluntary work, so it would be good to clarify them The second thing that we could do to improve the lives of refugees living here is to help more of them to get a decision within our target time.",3
Probably the most common reason that asylum seekers come to my surgery is that the deadline that they were given for a decision on their application has passed and they are wondering what is happening.,3
"It seems to me that, as he said, this argument is cutting through: someone with confirmed refugee status should be able to live with their family.",3
Member for Harborough has said about the right to work and tentatively suggest to all colleagues that they should remember that refugees come here with skills and want to work.,3
"Every refugee I have ever met has said, “I want to contribute my skills.” They want to be able to work, but, except with specific permission, they are not allowed to until they have been granted asylum by the Home Office.",4
"That would be okay, except that the Home Office target to complete asylum decisions within six months is frequently missed.",3
This also makes it harder for them to integrate when they are eventually given status.,3
"Members may or not be aware that, by contrast, Uganda allows refugees to work immediately, and provides them with land to grow food on and start-up finance to set up their own businesses, if that is what they wish to do.",3
"Of course, we need to discuss that and how it would work, but I would like us at least to be considering it as a principle There are many other things we can do to improve the way we treat refugees and reunite families, including ending indefinite immigration detention.",3
"We could also restore legal aid, so that refugees can be reunited with their families; prioritise free, high-quality English language teaching; and do more to create safe and legal routes to the UK, with refugee schemes such as the excellent vulnerable persons resettlement scheme.",3
"I applaud the Government’s efforts to keep that scheme going and make it is as good as it is, but I would like it to be made easier to make in-country or border applications for asylum and resettlement.",3
Keeping people in refugee camps or on the borders at best leaves people in limbo for years and at worst creates a recruiting ground for people traffickers and people who sexually exploit women.,2
Most reasonable people looking at the immigration rules now would agree that our refugee family reunion rules are still too narrowly drawn.,3
"Most strikingly, our rules on recognised child refugees in the UK are both outliers and pretty outrageous.",2
"In that article, she described the utter agony endured by two young child refugees because of separation from their families.",3
"It is incredibly sad, therefore, that other than Denmark, this is the only EU country that refuses to allow children to apply to have close family members join them here, if they can be found There cannot be a clearer illustration of why refugee family reunion is a win, win for everybody involved.",3
"It is clearly of huge benefit for the refugees here, reunited with their support network and better able to rebuild their lives.",3
It is good for us because it means that the refugees can integrate more easily.,3
"It can literally be lifesaving for those who are granted family reunion visas to join their families here, and by providing a safe legal route it stops them turning instead to traffickers and smugglers to find their way to the UK In response, the Government tend to turn to two or three arguments.",3
"The first is that immigration rules already make provisions for other family members to join refugees here, but in my view the alternative rules are barely worth the paper they are written on.",3
"The legal thresholds, costs and complexity make them a poor and pale substitute for proper refugee family reunion rights.",3
"Exceptional grants outside the rules are far too rare Secondly, the Government sometimes argue that expanding refugee family reunion rights would somehow incentivise dangerous journeys to the UK—we have heard a bit about that today.",3
The most significant point is that the rules keep too many family members out and so force them to turn to smugglers and traffickers and to make dangerous journeys.,2
"I did not know whether I would get the pronunciation of his constituency right, but I think I was close enough—I am afraid that that might be as good as I get on Thursday afternoon It is fitting that this debate is taking place during Refugee Week, because refugees are among the most vulnerable people on our planet.",3
"Whether they are fleeing war, famine, national disaster or religious persecution, refugees make perilous journeys to seek asylum in a safer country, often leaving behind their families and friends As my hon.",3
"Although he clearly has far more historical understanding and expertise than I could ever hope to have, I am sure that we are all aware of a number of waves of immigration from people fleeing persecution—from the Huguenots and other Calvinist and Protestant refugees fleeing persecution in Europe, right through to the 20th century, when we welcomed Jewish refugees from the continent.",3
"We can also be proud of and grateful for the incredible work that is done in all our communities by many individuals, groups and community organisations, particularly faith-based organisations that do so much to welcome and support those who seek asylum and safety within our shores Our current rules allow for partners and dependent children under the age of 18 to be granted a refugee reunion visa, but there is scope to extend those parameters in exceptional circumstances.",3
"As many Members have said, only refugees over the age of 18 are able to sponsor those visas Many of us are extremely sympathetic to the intentions of the two Bills that are currently before Parliament: the Refugees (Family Reunion) (No.",3
"Whereas the current policy means that refugee family reunion exists in many circumstances, we need to look at the best way of keeping families together without creating an incentive in which more children are put at risk by becoming unaccompanied migrants, which involves a huge amount of danger The hon.",3
A 2017 UN report that looked at child refugees into Italy offers some empirical evidence.,3
The number of unaccompanied child refugees travelling into Italy rose from 75% of all refugee children travelling into Italy in 2015 to 92% in the year to February 2017.,3
"It undoubtedly has many causes, but it seems likely that part of the reason behind it is an assumption that unaccompanied children are more likely to be granted asylum and that their families might be able to join them at a later date.",3
"We should be proud of the work that charities do, and how the British people contribute and help refugees both here and in the rest of the world.",4
"In Refugee Week, it has been wonderful to celebrate all the ways that refugees have enriched our lives and our society.",3
"Yesterday, I too was at Speaker’s House with the UNHCR to hear inspiring stories of refugees The celebrations have been somewhat overshadowed, however, by the tragic and shocking images from the US of children being forcibly separated from their families and caged like animals.",3
More than 100 were under the age of four The scenes from the US are a stark reminder of the consequences of the worst excesses of a hostile and criminalising approach to migrants and refugees.,3
"Our immigration system breaks up families, too.",2
"Currently, adult refugees can apply only for their spouse and dependent children under 18 to join them in the UK.",4
"After a terrible year-long journey, when he was crammed on a boat crossing the Mediterranean with 400 other people, he arrived in the UK and claimed asylum.",3
"He has no right to sponsor them to join him in the UK When we grant refugee status to someone, we need to provide them with a realistic chance of integrating in the UK.",4
"That means English language training and not cutting off asylum support after 28 days, which is shorter than the minimum five weeks that it takes to apply for universal credit, and it means allowing them to reunite with their families The private Member’s Bill from the hon.",3
Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar will rectify some anomalies and allow refugee families to be reunited in the UK.,3
"They have argued that we do not want to create pull factors to attract refugees to come to the UK, as if there were not enough push factors to force people to flee their homes.",3
I hope that the Minister will unequivocally condemn Trump’s remarks about allowing the US to be a “migrant camp” or “refugee holding facility”.,3
"Lady has not been in her place for the entire debate, and I have very little time The Green Paper on integration that has come forward from my right hon.",3
"Friend the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government is crucially important, and I have pushed with both officials and Cabinet colleagues the importance of people having the language teaching they need to enable them to integrate as best they possibly can, and I absolutely hear the calls for how work should be a part of that My hon.",3
"From my earliest days at the Home Office I have been struck by the links between organised crime, people trafficking, modern slavery and violence against women and girls, and we are determined to do our utmost to tackle trafficking.",3
Breaking the smugglers’ business model and their trafficking rings remains a key priority for this Government.,3
"Our naval assets have destroyed 182 smuggling boats and saved 13,400 lives since the operation began, but we are of course conscious that we continue to see boats come across the Mediterranean and children and families making very dangerous journeys I have little time left, but I would like to lapse somewhat into the anecdotal.",3
I said that I sought in our refugee and immigration policies to ensure that I chose not to model myself on their President.,3
"They told me that what they had found most moving during their time in Europe over the past few weeks was meeting individual refugees and hearing their stories, and we have had a little of that this afternoon from individual Members who have highlighted the excellent work being done in their constituencies.",3
"Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar, because his private Member’s Bill and this afternoon’s debate give us the opportunity to reflect carefully on such issues This Government recognise the need for a fair and humane immigration system and, within that, the importance of policies that work for individual asylum seekers and those granted refugee status.",3
"We are currently reviewing our policy on refugee family reunion in the context of our wider asylum and resettlement strategy, and I look forward to continuing my productive discussions with hon.",3
Her Majesty’s Opposition believe that human rights should be at the centre of foreign policy.,3
"We note, for example, that the United States has sanctioned Maung Maung Soe, one of the generals responsible for the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya in Myanmar Last year, the Criminal Finances Act 2017 enabled the Government to freeze the assets of people responsible for such crimes, and this Bill will enable us to ban visas and prevent such people traveling here.",3
"In 2014, David Cameron wrote to the British overseas territories recommending that they introduce public registers—the UK introduced a public register in 2016—and new clause 6 sets out a timetable for them to do so by 2020.",3
"Unfortunately, the British overseas territories and Crown dependencies are major actors.",3
"That is another reason why new clause 6 is very much to be welcomed The scope for hiding large funds facilitates serious international crimes: drug dealing, people trafficking, sanctions busting, illegal arms sales and terrorism.",3
"Over and again, the names of the British overseas territories and Crown dependencies come up when these crimes are finally uncovered.",3
"It has, necessarily, pushed the boundaries of what the drafters of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the parliamentarians who scrutinised it could have envisaged.",3
"I know she and the Committee have significant and legitimate concerns about the operation of the memorandum of understanding between NHS Digital and the Home Office, which currently allows the sharing of non-clinical information, principally address information, for immigration purposes.",3
No longer will the names of overstayers and illegal entrants be sought against health service records to find current address details.,3
"The data sharing, relying on powers under the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the National Health Service Act 2006 and the Health and Social Care Act 2008, will only be used to trace an individual who is being considered for deportation action having been investigated for, or convicted of, a serious criminal offence that results in a minimum sentence of at least 12 months in prison The Government have a long-held policy on what level of serious criminality is deserving of deportation, given statutory force by the UK Borders Act 2007.",3
"When a custodial sentence of more than 12 months has been given, consideration for deportation must therefore follow.",3
"Henceforth, the Home Office will only be able to use the memorandum of understanding to trace an individual who is being considered for deportation action having been convicted of a serious criminal offence, or when their presence is considered non-conducive to the public good—for example, when they present a risk to public security but have yet to be convicted of a criminal offence.",3
It has already been mentioned that the doorway to the UK for refugees is the Home Office.,3
"Over many weeks we have been saddened by reports on immigration matters: the Windrush generation, including a former mayoress in East Anglia, who have been here for 30 or 40 years and now face deportation; even a wealthy owner of a football club was not able to have his visa renewed—I hope it has happened by now.",3
Do we start with the staff dealing with immigration; is that where the weakness lies?,3
Who is leading and inspiring on the immigration question?,3
But the report says that by December 2017 only £2.4 million of that had been spent The report is unhappy with the extent of the search for direct information from refugees themselves.,3
It states that the Home Office interviewed nine refugees and then met a refugee family from Amman.,3
"If anyone came to north Wales, they would meet more refugees than that.",3
So we question whether there is enough data and evidence from the refugees themselves.,3
"The report damned, “the absence of a national integration strategy” The pace of immigration settlement leaves a lot to be desired.",3
That works out at 22 refugees a month.,3
"The civil war in Syria has lasted far longer than envisaged when David Cameron pledged that the UK would welcome 20,000 refugees by 2020.",3
"As the report says, there is no commitment to continue resettlement after that year or to increase the number from 20,000 to accommodate the extra years of civil war As has already been mentioned, it takes 35 weeks from acceptance on a resettlement scheme until the refugees are actually on a plane to the UK.",3
"Having two people could avoid many wrong decisions We will have a new immigration Bill—I am sure the Minister is looking forward to it—which will give us the opportunity to put right much that is the cause of anxiety, confusion and poverty.",3
"More than anything else, we need a leadership on immigration matters that has vision, compassion and inspiration.",2
"It is largely a passport-free zone between the UK and Ireland and the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, which are not in the EU.",4
"It is a changing context and is not copper-fastened, but rather left to politics, convention and legislative reference In the United Kingdom, Section 1(3) of the Immigration Act 1971 provides that arrival in and departure from the UK from or to elsewhere in the common travel area cannot be subject to passport or border control.",4
"As we know, the Government have a policy to create a hostile environment for migrants who end up with irregular status.",2
"On current plans, that would in future include migrants from elsewhere in the European Union, with the probable exception of Irish citizens.",3
The question then turns to how the Government will enforce their desire for such significantly increased migration control while maintaining an open border.,3
"If the Government are sincere in saying they do not want a hard border, where will the checking of papers take place and how will it be done?",3
The position paper is limited to setting out that future UK immigration arrangements will maintain the common travel area free from “routine” border controls It looks like an indication that the Government may be considering reviving plans for selective mobile checks on people not perceived to be British or Irish citizens.,3
"The Government at that time intended having “ad hoc” checks on the land border, because of concerns about illegal immigration, that would target non-British and non-Irish citizens.",3
The suggestion was that there should be passport checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.,3
"The policy was defeated in this House by an amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, following concerns raised by Peers in debate and by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission about both racial profiling and internal immigration controls within the United Kingdom.",3
"There was very real concern about it The proposal envisaged non-common travel area nationals—persons who were neither Irish nor British citizens—having to carry identity documents to cross the land border, with British and Irish citizens not having to do so.",3
"In a post-Brexit context, under current plans, there would also be the question of distinguishing between EU citizens who had acquired rights by virtue of residence prior to Brexit, and those EU nationals arriving subsequently who may remain non-visa nationals but will be subject to restrictions.",3
"I have been drawing on research by lawyers from both Queen’s University and the University of Ulster, as well as human rights organisations in Northern Ireland, who are concerned about this As for potential solutions in a post-Brexit context which would avoid the need for a hard border and the risks of widespread profiling—pulling out people who they think look like foreigners—you would have to make some special arrangement.",3
"To some extent, it flies in the face of some of the policing matters that the noble Lord, Lord Patten, who I see in his place, sought to put in place under the bilateral treaty agreement to avoid problems of this kind in policing and border control.",3
"It would not be compatible with the treaty that we have entered into with the Good Friday agreement to require a dual Irish-British citizen, or someone identifying as British, to rely on their British citizenship alone to access entitlements or equal treatment in Northern Ireland.",4
"Are we to have mobile units that will stop people Recently there was rather a high-profile litigation case against the Home Office, supported by the equality commission, involving a British woman who was stopped at Belfast City Airport by an immigration officer.",3
"She was told by the immigration officer that she had been singled out as she, “looked foreign and obviously not from here” She was black.",3
"Regarding immigration controls, cars are often stopped by the authorities on both sides.",3
The guards recently arrested people who had entered the Republic from Northern Ireland whom they believed were illegal immigrants.,3
"Secondly, employers should face greater penalties if they employ people who are not there legally, and that should be done on both sides of the border.",2
"To get on to the island, they have to come through a port and the immigration system of the Republic of Ireland or they have to come through the United Kingdom.",4
I would have thought that creating disincentives for people to enter the jurisdiction illegally would be as good as anything rather than having to look at every individual who appears.,3
"Happily, it is not the only way, but, sadly, it is one way in which to downgrade our higher education, thinking of higher education almost entirely in terms of how many students can be educated and how much money it can bring in I want to begin by alerting your Lordships to this danger and point out that the case for the presence of overseas students is not entirely or even exclusively economic; it is a fourfold case.",3
"If you take just first-year students and not the total number, the figures are even more striking: 235,315 were from overseas, and they made up 23% of all our first-year students.",3
It is also striking that 25% of all postgraduates are from overseas.,3
"Of our academic staff, 28% were born overseas.",3
"In STEM subjects, 31% of our academic staff are from overseas.",3
"There are lots of research projects that simply would not continue unless overseas students were involved, and there are several courses that simply would not be taught if overseas people were not involved.",3
"As a result of that, they are able to oblige us in other areas when we need their help, and, in formulating the policies of their Government—economic, financial, political or other—they are able to think of our interests The fourth case for overseas students, and the one I am very keen on, is the cultural case.",3
"Each overseas student interacts with at least 20 to 25 local students and, in so doing, sensitises them to a different outlook, broadens their sympathies and helps to create a multicultural society to match the multicultural world in which we live.",3
"Given all the benefits of overseas students, why do we have reason to worry?",2
"We used to get students from a variety of countries, but increasingly we find that, under the impact of our rules, the number of countries from which our overseas students come is in decline.",3
"First, the whole business of including students in the immigration figures is ridiculous.",2
Students do not come as immigrants.,3
"I did not come as an immigrant and did not see myself as an immigrant Secondly, since 2012 the post-study work visa has been abolished.",3
"A large number of Indian students are deterred precisely by this Thirdly, we need to increase the number of grants and scholarships to overseas students so that more of them are able to come.",3
"If we can benefit from that in this way, surely we can increase the number of scholarships and grants to overseas students Fourthly, there must be a national strategy of the kind that France has, where they decided to double the number of students from India and China in the next two or three years.",3
"There has to be a national strategy We should also create a hospitable, not a hostile, environment for immigration—noble Lords know what I mean.",3
Our own universities have to be more proactive and put on imaginative courses that attract students from overseas.,2
"The experience of overseas students in our country must also improve, so that they can benefit from being here and do not suffer ill-treatment of any kind.",2
"So it is important that students coming from overseas should be well treated Finally, there is the Indian diaspora of nearly 2 million people.",3
What use are we making of this diaspora in attracting overseas students?,4
"There are ways in which that can be done and it has been done in Canada, such as by welcoming overseas students when they come, celebrating their festivals and enjoying their holidays, and in that way making them feel part of and integrating them into the local community.",4
"As we noted in our call for evidence: “The vote to leave the EU presents the UK with an opportunity to restructure immigration policy” At that time, though, business anxiety remained high and, as we said: “Some sectors … have stated that continued access to migrant labour is crucial for the success of their businesses” The committee wished to examine the competing claims about EU migration and the labour market.",3
"Taking as a starting point that EU migration would be reduced, we set out to identify practical measures that government and businesses could take to mitigate the impact of this change The issue that emerged and threaded its way through much of our inquiry was problems with data underlying many assumptions about the UK’s reliance on migrant workers.",3
"One witness told us: “Evidence-based policy-making needs data that is fit for purpose” It was a great surprise to me and others on the committee how unfit for purpose many of the immigration statistics were The headline immigration figure that we hear announced at regular intervals is that for annual net migration, and the most recently available numbers show that for the year to June 2017, net migration to the UK was 230,000.",3
"Who is counted; who is not Professor Portes suggested that, “when you come into the country as an immigrant”, you might, “have better things to do than stop and chat with an ONS official for 20 minutes” We know that those arriving on overnight flights are missed, as are those travelling across the Irish land border.",3
"Student departures are radically underestimated, and the definition of migrant means that only those changing residence for 12 months or more are captured, missing seasonal and short-term workers The committee examined other sources of immigration data to see whether they could assist in overcoming those deficiencies.",3
National insurance numbers should provide an objective check: every overseas adult registering for a number is captured.,3
"The most recent report on exit checks is enlightening, but covers only non-EEA nationals and is limited to whether or not they obeyed their visa conditions We considered how this could be improved.",3
National insurance numbers can be linked to passport data and tax and PAYE returns to show who is employed and where.,3
"As we noted in our report, there is limited reliable data on how reliant businesses and industries are on EU immigration.",3
"Both a recent NFU report and the 2013 Migration Advisory Committee report suggest that the vast majority are EU migrants … In addition, around 95 per cent of Official Veterinarians in the meat hygiene sector are from the EU” This is just one example of a problem that affects many sectors.",3
"The Government indicated that they will be conducting their own, “extensive programme of engagement and evidence gathering”, and will form a new immigration policy once that process is complete On the data side, the ONS is working to improve the data and has a programme in place to increasingly present information based on administrative data and to move to reliance on these sources by 2019.",3
Friend raises the very important issue of the immigration system.,2
"The package of measures to bring greater transparency for Members and constituents includes monthly updates to the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee with the latest position on detention, removals and deportations.",3
"There is also the independent external oversight and challenge of a lessons-learned review that is already under way to establish how members of the Windrush generation came to be entangled in measures designed for illegal immigrants, why that was not spotted sooner and whether the right corrective measures are now in place.",3
"Friend the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker), who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on human trafficking and modern slavery, and the hon.",3
"Today is World Anti-Slavery Day, and Tuesday was World Food Day, so this is a fitting time to start looking seriously at how we end this exploitation Long after the Morecambe bay disaster in 2004, when 21 Chinese illegal migrant labourers drowned while picking cockles, the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority is still finding cases of human trafficking and slavery in the UK food industry.",3
"A chicken factory in America was discovered to be employing illegal and under-age workers, blackmailing them to work for minimal pay in unsafe conditions under the threat of deportation.",3
Quite often it is undocumented migrants who are most vulnerable to exploitation.,2
"Some 60% of UK tinned tomatoes come from southern Italy, where illegal gangmasters, who are part of organised crime, control worker recruitment and supervision.",3
"In Ireland, a permit scheme for fishermen has seen African and Asian men trafficked on to trawlers, doing 20 hours a day of manual labour, legally bound to the employer and too scared to speak up for fear of arrest or deportation.",3
Ireland now has a tier 2 ranking for trafficking—on a par with Indonesia and India—due to the Government’s failure adequately to protect victims and successfully convict traffickers The Environmental Justice Foundation uncovered horrific examples of slavery in the Thai seafood sector.,3
"Some 59% of fishing workers had witnessed the murder of a fellow worker There is also evidence of Rohingya migrants from Myanmar being trafficked from camps, and even detention centres, and sold to Thai fishing vessels as slaves, yet millions of pounds’-worth of seafood products are still imported to the UK from Thailand every year.",3
I want to make it clear that this is not just something happening overseas that has little to do with us.,3
That is what migrants do.,3
"That is why it is time that we had a more positive narrative on migration As we heard earlier, Government Members and Ministers would far prefer to talk about illegal immigration than the plight of the Windrush generation.",3
"As I said earlier, no one on the Opposition Benches supports illegal migration.",3
We are all in favour of the removal of people who are here illegally.,2
"We could start with the number of prisoners who judges have directed should be removed at end of sentence, but many are not removed because of an organisational failure by the Home Office in getting the paperwork correct For our part, the Labour party has pledged to recruit 500 extra border guards to deal with illegal immigration, people and drug trafficking, and smuggling.",3
We do not want to support illegal immigrants; we want to prevent people who do not have the right to be here from entering the country.,2
"This Government and their immediate predecessors cut the border guards, so it is distressing to hear them talk about illegal immigration, rather than focusing on what is happening to the Windrush generation The Windrush generation are here legally, yet they continue to be talked about by some Government Members as if they were here illegally.",3
What type of policy making results in British people being put on the street because of this so-called bearing down on illegal immigrants?,3
"People have also been given biometric identity cards, but they want to know why they cannot have passports like anyone else.",3
Has his Department been in contact with British embassies and high commissions in Commonwealth countries so that they can use their best endeavours to establish where people have been wrongly deported?,3
"Similarly, how many people “voluntarily” left under threat of deportation?",3
What information has the Home Secretary’s Department requested and received from Heads of Government of Caribbean nations and others regarding people who have been deported or otherwise prevented from returning to the UK?,3
"Secondly, I will also be writing to her each month on the latest position on detentions, removals and deportations.",3
"That review will seek to draw out how members of the Windrush generation came to be entangled in measures designed for illegal immigrants, why that was not spotted sooner and whether the right corrective measures are now in place.",3
"As I told the House on Monday, any information provided to the taskforce will be used for no other immigration purpose than that of helping people to confirm their status.",3
Any information provided will not be passed to immigration enforcement.,3
A Commonwealth citizen who settled in the UK before 1973 will now be entitled to apply for British citizenship—the legal status that they deserve—free of charge.,4
We have made it clear that we will make the process they need to go through to get citizenship as simple as possible.,3
"That is why I will bring forward the necessary legislation to cover fee exemptions, fee reductions and changes to the citizenship process as soon as possible.",3
"It will be overseen by an independent person, and we will consult on its scope, because it is important that we get the detail of this scheme right from the moment it begins It is essential in this debate that we do not lose sight of the distinction between legal and illegal migration.",3
"Successive Governments, including the previous Labour Government, have put in place what I would call a “compliant environment”—measures to tackle illegal migration—and this is a perfectly sensible approach to take.",3
"The first NHS treatment charges for overseas visitors and illegal migrants were introduced in 1982, as were checks by employers on someone’s right to work in 1997, measures on access to benefits in 1999 and civil penalties for employing illegal migrants in 2008.",3
"Measures over many years to tackle illegal immigration are of course a good thing, and we stand by those measures.",3
"We are protecting our public services, and taking action against rogue employers, landlords and organised crime groups who exploit vulnerable migrants and damage our communities.",3
We carefully balance the need to tackle illegal immigration with the need to protect those who are here lawfully from unintended consequences.,2
"They need access to independent legal advice, and they need financial help for the purpose I shall make a couple of general remarks on illegal immigration.",3
"Some Conservative Members attempted to ask the Opposition, “What would you do about illegal immigration?” We dishonour the Windrush generation if we make this a debate about illegal immigration, and if we miss the point about the culture of disbelief that fuels the hostile environment, which, as the scandal has shown, sits at the heart of what has happened.",3
It is that culture of disbelief that renders British citizens and British nationals as if they were not just immigrants but illegal too.,2
It visits upon them the ignominy and humiliation of being deemed illegal in their own land.,2
"That assumption, which is made at the heart of our system, does not simply go after illegal immigrants; as we have said, it goes after those of us who look like we could be immigrants.",2
"We have talked a lot about illegal immigration sitting at the heart of this debate, but what we are not talking about so much is race I say to hon.",3
I promise that the protection of a British passport will not help one little bit.,4
"The system will treat them as if they were dirt on the bottom of its shoe, and that is not good enough That happens to British nationals on a daily basis when they apply for visitor visas or spousal visas.",4
"If they can get past the income threshold and prove the legitimacy of their love for somebody they fallen in love with and married, the system still makes them take a DNA test to prove that a child who might have been born while they visited their foreign-based spouse is in fact their child.",3
I say to Government Members: do not be complacent about what your system is doing on a daily basis to people who have the protection of a British passport.,3
I have one of the highest immigration caseloads in this country and I see this daily.,2
It is a moment when we can make a choice to have a better debate about immigration.,3
"Whether it was UKIP, the BNP or some of the more excessive narratives of our tabloid press, issues of “asylum” and “refugee”, “illegal” and “legal”, got conflated with “them” and “us, “foreign” and “different”, “alien” and “domestic”.",3
"All of us, looking to our political bases, became anxious about seeing our support nibbled away, and instead of making the positive, liberal case for the contribution that immigrants make—the case made by my right hon.",3
"Jessica has served our community in West Ham, working for a charity helping refugees and migrants, so what an irony that in March she was fired from that job because she could not prove her right to work.",3
"These citizens were stopped at the GP reception, the police station, the bank counter, the workplace, the jobcentre—all those places became hostile environments for Jessica, Gem and many others Papers are demanded—papers that many do not have—and when Windrush citizens cannot produce these papers, they are plunged into a nightmare of hostile demands and constant suspicion, and behind it all is the threat of deportation and the destruction of their lives, with jobs, housing and healthcare yanked away.",3
Their trust in their country has been breached and cannot easily be restored There is massive anxiety in my community about immigration removal flights that may have British Windrush citizens on board.,3
Can Ministers at the Home Office imagine just how badly they will have further betrayed the trust of generations if they fail to get a grip on this and British citizens are again deported Let me finish by echoing what my right hon.,3
"First, we cannot underestimate the administrative difficulties faced by many in the Windrush generation, and indeed people from other Commonwealth countries who came here prior to 1971, in proving their citizenship to the Home Office.",3
"That means compensation for all those who were blocked from accessing vital services, who were threatened with deportation or whose lives have in any way been adversely affected by this failure.",3
We have been told that it is putting off foreign doctors and nurses from coming to the UK.,3
It is about tackling illegal immigration.,3
"and learned Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry), who speaks for the SNP, accused Conservative MPs of blaming migrants for the problems in our society and in our infrastructure.",3
"Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr Harper), on immigration and the economy, in which I praised the east Europeans who recently came to this country and who have made such a contribution.",3
"and learned Lady and others asked, is the sheer scale of immigration, both legal and illegal, that this country has experienced in recent years.",2
"The scale is unprecedented, and I quote David Wood, the former director general of immigration enforcement, who told the Home Affairs Committee on 10 October 2017 that he estimated there to be at least 1 million people illegally resident in the UK—that is equivalent to the populations of Edinburgh and Glasgow added together.",3
"Frankly, it is an abuse of the legitimate citizenship held by all those who have been spoken of today I very much regret what has happened, but a number of hon.",3
"If we do not, we will truly give rise to populists, UKIP will get back into the game and the fringes of politics will come back People have to see that we are dealing with the problems that matter to them, and our constituents want us to address illegal immigration.",3
"We all accept that, so it is about striking a balance, but let us be clear that part of the balance is a robust immigration policy that deals with people who are here illegally and, if need be, deports them I intervened on the shadow Home Secretary, and I am pleased that she is happy to confirm that she accepts the need to tackle illegal immigration.",3
"We need to work together to build an immigration system that is firm but fair, as many Governments have pledged over the years.",3
"It is not easy, but we need to respond to legitimate public concern that the level of immigration, and particularly illegal immigration, must be sustainable, otherwise we will lose the public’s support and they will turn to parties that are not so palatable.",3
"There is much to admire When I speak to people in those migrant communities in my constituency, I am also reminded that they feel very strongly that we must not lose sight of the distinction between legal and illegal migration.",3
"They feel that they have jumped through many hoops, done all the right things and played by the rules, and they do not want people who have not done the same simply to be allowed to come to this country illegally I would argue for balance.",3
I also think there is more we could do to make our immigration system as a whole more humane.,2
"We could be quicker in processing asylum claims and make sure we are quicker with visa applications, so that people do not fear missing family occasions.",3
"I welcome the Government’s integration strategy, and I would like us to do more to ensure that everyone can take part in our society Even as we do all those things, we must not throw the baby out with the bathwater.",3
"Even today, a new poll has shown that the great majority of people in this country want tighter control of migration, and I think it is right to bear down on illegal immigration.",3
Most illegal immigration takes place not as a result of people sneaking across borders but because people overstay in this country.,2
"So it is right to have measures in place that make it more difficult to be an illegal immigrant and that help us to reduce illegal immigration, which is unfair immigration If the motion was in favour of more humane treatment of the Windrush generation, I would vote for it in a heartbeat.",3
There was some temporary excitement among my friends yesterday when they read a headline in the paper suggesting that the son of an immigrant bus driver had been elevated to the position of Home Secretary—they thought that the honour could have been bestowed on me already.,3
"Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Sajid Javid), for the moment However, as I say, I am the son of an immigrant bus driver.",3
"He never travelled to another country and I cannot imagine how disturbed he would have been to be faced with the prospect of having to provide documents that would allow him a passport to travel to other places around the world to join and support family members, as the hon.",4
Friend the Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge) mentioned that we have approximately 1 million illegal immigrants in the UK.,3
Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Nick Boles) had been talking about the fact that we need to reconsider our approach to our immigration policy in this country.,3
"In 1997, a poll showed that 3% of the people who were asked their view on immigration thought that it was the most important issue facing the country.",3
"I am concerned by the argument that the world can be neatly and easily divided into good “compliant migrants” on the one hand and wicked and nasty “illegal immigrants” on the other, and by the argument that the hostile environment will affect only the latter while everyone else carries on utterly unharmed.",3
"Some are legally here and some are undocumented, but they are as far from the desperate stereotype of the wicked illegal immigrant as it is possible to get.",3
"They are entitled to British citizenship under the British Nationality Act 1981 if they register, but few are registering.",4
"He worked with the British armed forces in Helmand province for two years, but his asylum claim has been turned down.",3
"Also forced to face that environment are the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Eritreans who were wrongly refused asylum on the basis of the Home Office’s dodgy country guidance.",3
"They were presumed guilty on the basis of a spreadsheet from the company that had messed up the testing in the first place, and were then rounded up and deported without even being allowed to see or hear the evidence against them, let alone challenge it in a tribunal in this country.",3
"All those people might be caught up in the broad and pejorative term “illegal migrants”, but they deserve a humane rather than a hostile response Also caught up in the hostile environment are those who—just like the Windrush generation, and just like every Member in the House—are perfectly entitled to be here.",3
"Among them will be 9 million British citizens without passports, because 43% of landlords and landladies say that they are less likely to let to such citizens now that the hostile environment has made them petrified of getting “right to rent” checks wrong.",3
"That applies particularly to those who are foreign, look foreign, or have a foreign-sounding name The hostile environment has brought no gain, but so much pain.",3
It is clear to anyone who has had any engagement with the Home Office that our immigration system is broken.,3
There has been a culture on the right and the far right and in the printed press that places immigrants and immigration at the heart of society’s ills.,2
"I represent a constituency that has one of the lowest levels of immigration in the country yet, you know what, we still have hospitals that are underfunded, schools that are under immense pressure and a woefully inadequate transport system.",2
"None of those ills was caused by migration Returning to the question of our broken immigration system, I want briefly to outline some of the things that I think are wrong.",2
People engaging with the immigration system have to wait far too long for a response.,2
"The fees are extortionate, and there is little or no help or immigration advice.",2
"The asylum process is degrading, frustrating and punishing, and many vulnerable, brave people are treated without respect The system is built on a presumption that everyone who wants to come to this country is a cheat and a liar who must be found out, and that their intention must be to defraud the system and to steal.",2
"Charges, borders, barriers, searches, detention centres, medical inspections, dawn raids, go-home vans, charter flight removals and hostile environments therefore seem necessary, but that is a flawed assumption based on a superiority complex.",2
"We might think, from the way some people talk in the press, that we have open borders, and we hear the perpetuation of the unfounded myth that migrants receive preferential treatment.",3
"But now the mask has fallen, and we need some truth and honesty, starting with the publication of every single document relating to this fiasco, so that people can see and understand the scale of the problem We should not be shoved down the path of the good migrant versus bad migrant narrative.",3
Where is the humanity in our immigration system?,2
I speak today as an immigrant who has lived in Bedford—one of the most diverse towns in the UK—for 26 years.,3
"To hear about how the Windrush generation—British citizens—have been treated is chilling for anyone who has come to live in Britain legally from Commonwealth countries and from elsewhere, and now even for EU citizens Like most MPs, I receive a lot of correspondence about immigration issues, including from people who want to go overseas to attend important events in their relatives’ lives.",3
"I have seen the effects of the hostile environment policy since 2014 and have felt the effects of a shift in attitudes towards immigrants—personally and through the stories that my constituents tell me In recent years, the Home Office has forced people from parts of Africa and the subcontinent to endure increasingly long waits to have their cases considered, labelling them “complex” and refusing to offer timescales or reasons for the delays.",3
"Such cases sometimes involve unaccompanied child refugees who, having made the dangerous journey to get here, have been left in limbo for years with no certainty that they will not be deported when they come of age.",3
"Entry clearance officers overseas now seem routinely to refuse visas from certain parts of the world, even when people have visited and returned several times before Things have felt different and difficult in recent years.",3
A manager of a nursing home contacted me just the other day to say she cannot get visas for qualified nurses.,3
"Nurses cannot get visas to come and look after sick, elderly patients in my constituency, in an out-of-hospital facility, because of Home Office policy.",3
The Windrush crisis has revealed something rotten at the heart of this Government: a blurring of the line between looking like an immigrant and being an immigrant.,3
We can see now that race and immigration cannot be separated.,3
"They have known all this time, yet they cannot tell us how many people have been wrongfully deported, wrongfully detained, and wrongfully denied healthcare and public services.",2
"Ministers have spoken of “granting” British citizenship, but let us be clear: these people are already British citizens.",3
"Their citizenship needs to be confirmed, not granted, and indefinite leave to remain is not good enough The Government have set up a taskforce.",3
What discussions has she had with the Justice Secretary on the re-introduction of legal aid for immigration cases The Windrush generation have suffered a great injustice.,3
"In 2013, the Tories exempted immigration cases from legal aid, so people cannot challenge wrong decisions.",3
There are highly skilled migrants in the UK now whose visas are being refused on the basis of minor tax errors.,3
The Government must reintroduce legal aid for immigration cases Justice for Windrush also means compensation.,3
The Home Secretary has said he wants an immigration system that behaves more humanely and with a greater sense of fairness.,3
"The cohorts of people who might be prohibited from studying are adult immigration offenders—for example, overstayers who are not asylum seekers; adults whose appeal rights have been exhausted, other than care leavers receiving local authority support; adults being deported; foreign criminals who have not made an asylum claim; and all adults for whom a deportation order is signed and enforceable.",3
"These are: a non-rebated own-resources contribution maintaining our existing contribution under subsection (1)(b); amendments to regulatory arrangements of most concern to Parliament—and I suggest animal welfare as one—under subsection (1)(c), and stronger border controls under subsection (1)(a), on which I intend to concentrate my remarks My amendment, which is not Labour policy, would signal to our European partners an alternative to Brexit and end the delay which is on course to undermine our economy and, in my view, our industrial base.",3
"I am arguing today a direct linkage between loose border controls, insensitivity to public concerns over immigration and developing political extremism in both the United Kingdom and Europe My amendment finds its origins in February 2016, after David Cameron’s return from Brussels, having failed to secure a meaningful deal.",3
"Millions voted leave due to a feeling of national insecurity, stemming from what they believe to be permeable borders throughout Europe.",3
They believe that we have lost control over immigration and fear migratory flows across Europe from other continents that will destabilise populations.,2
"Our leadership in this country is in denial, and most frightening of all is that the pursuit of integration in areas such as education and the tearing down of indefensible cultural boundaries, which are desperately needed, have fallen victim to political correctness.",3
"The public know it, and all over Europe the public are kicking the system and challenging permeable borders.",2
When we argue that migration is not the cause of all the insecurity they point to threats to their jobs and unscrupulous employers who insist on passive cheap migrant labour sheltering behind government indifference.,3
It is all an invitation to political extremism and anti-migrant prejudice.,2
Denial at home is only surpassed by denial overseas.,3
"All over Europe people are in revolt; in some EU states, even freedom of movement is being questioned I spent Christmas researching anti-immigration and wider extremist movements generally in 32 inner and outer European states.",3
"I used my leave vote to promote that debate, on Schengen and wider European border control issues.",3
"This amendment is a modest attempt to forward that debate I recognise that tougher border controls may be limited in effect, but that would depend on border management policies, whether we introduce work permits, ID requirements and the profile of social support.",3
The Government’s Brexit-inspired immigration advisory committee recommendations due later this year might point to a way forward.,3
At least we can be sure that taking back control of borders would help in planning our public services.,3
"There will be no borders, just regional differences and cultural traditions, but not now.",3
"If we win a new deal on the basis of the agenda in this amendment, we could win a second referendum with a resounding vote and our nightmare would be over This has not been an easy contribution for me to make, particularly as I personally embrace immigration in its most positive form and in warmth.",3
"It is perfectly reasonable to debate all sorts of views on immigration but proposals to uncap it in an unmeasurable way are really not suited to a declaration of policy, let alone legislation I remember as a journalist when I had to attend all the party conferences, in 1976 at the Liberal Party conference—the first conference that the noble Lord, Lord Steel, had when he was leader of the Liberal Party—the Young Liberals, who are always inclined to anarchism, had a resolution that there should be completely free immigration into the UK.",3
Clause 1 specifies nine categories of family members of an individual who have been granted refugee status whose application to enter or remain in the UK the Secretary of State would be obliged to grant unless the refusal was in the interests of national security.,3
"Immigration statistics are always complicated, but at its simplest I would point out that the number of people who have been granted asylum over the 10 years up to 2017—and this is the lowest figure—is 56,921.",3
No limit is really envisaged I believe that any Government are obliged to limit immigration to a number that can be absorbed into the community.,3
"In that context, I remind your Lordships that the latest 12-month figure for net migration into the UK is 244,000 In practice the Bill would open the door to large numbers of economic migrants.",3
"All that can be said is that market forces suggest that migration would continue until the standard of living in the receiving country was no longer high enough to attract economic migrants—thus, the only way of limiting those who want to come is by restricting numbers I must mention one other deeply worrying aspect of immigration control in the UK: the capacity of the Home Office to administer it.",3
"On that matter, I am wholly on the side of the migrants.",3
"I got to know many West Indians and learnt that they have the best sense of humour of any people in the world, and I like and respect them enormously I am talking about the fact that it seems that the Home Office immigration service is systemically corrupt.",3
"The great majority, nearly all from the immigration department, resulted in prison sentences, two of them for nine years.",3
"However, the Bill as drafted would make immigration an open season for doubtful and corrupt activities, leaving Ministers little opportunity for questioning what was happening.",3
The noble Baroness spoke about the importance of family reunion to integration.,3
"I was a member of the inquiry set up by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Refugees into integration, and I shall say a little about what we found, because I think it is relevant as we discuss the amendment The evidence that we received from a wide range of organisations underlined the psychological impact.",3
"Then there are refugees who are here, who have families still in conflict areas or who are still at risk, who are worried sick about what is happening to their families.",2
A number of people brought home to us the general impact on integration—that barriers to family reunion create barriers to integration.,3
It is in all our interests that refugees are able fully to integrate into our society.,2
"In our findings and recommendations, we argued that, “successfully being reunited with family members is an important step in helping refugees to integrate” We also argued that, “the definition of family in the Immigration Rules remains very restrictive.",3
"Additionally, the lack of family reunion rights for unaccompanied children is a barrier to their successful integration” We recommended that they should be allowed to sponsor parents and siblings The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, spoke about statistics and numbers, but we are talking about people.",3
"The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, rightly said that we were not talking about immigrants—although, of course, migrants are also people.",3
"We are talking about refugees, and she gave some very pertinent potential examples.",3
"I ask the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, to think back to when he was an adolescent and put himself in their shoes—a young man who has left his country, for whatever reason, as a refugee.",3
"I hope that will put the noble Lord’s concerns to rest a little I want to say a bit about the benefits of migration because, too often, we have these debates and we all defend migration, but we should talk a little about what migrants do for us.",3
"I will use the word “migrants”, because that was the term used in the speech by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford.",3
Researchers who study human migration say that countries fear that letting in some refugees will encourage more and that migrants will be an economic burden.,3
"Even without a worker shortage, migrants need not be a burden.",2
"On 4 September 2015, the World Bank, the UN International Labour Organization and the OECD club of rich countries issued a report concluding that, “in most countries, migrants pay more in taxes and social contributions than they receive” In a study in 2014, researchers at University College London found that both European and non-European immigrants to the UK more than paid their way.",3
"The reasons, say the researchers, are not economic, but fear of the cultural impact of foreigners.",3
"But all the evidence shows that, with a positive attitude in communities and good leadership, the host community and migrants both benefit.",3
I will just end by saying that there are articles in Psychology Today that show the psychological benefits to the host communities of having a welcoming attitude to migrants.,3
"I also cite the example of a small, remote island in Finland, called Nagu, which welcomed refugees.",3
The residents there are very grateful to the refugees for enriching their lives.,3
They account for more than half of the world’s nations where same-sex relations are illegal.,2
"We are building a lot of data from well-established resources, such as the World Bank, from which we can show that countries where there is a good attitude towards LGBTI inclusion have better economic performance, are more competitive, have greater levels of entrepreneurship and foreign direct investment, and fare better in global markets.",3
"She will know that over the past year and a half I have submitted endless questions to her department, principally about the detention of LGBTI asylum seekers.",3
"These show, quite horrifyingly, that two-thirds of people who apply for asylum on the basis of being LGB—not T: we have excluded trans people—fail.",3
I asked the noble Baroness a few months ago what efforts were being made by those supervising such deportations to ensure that people would not be imperilled when they go back.,3
"Although campaigners have welcomed improvement in conditions at Yarl’s Wood since the implementation of the adults at risk policy, which should mean that survivors of sexual and gender-based violence would not normally be detained and that the routine detention of pregnant women would be ended, there are still concerns for detained women Today sees a lobby of Parliament by refugee and migrant women under the banner of All Women Count, which calls for safety, dignity and liberty for all women regardless of status in the UK.",3
"The Government currently lock up 1,600 asylum-seeking women every year.",2
"Last year, this group conducted interviews with 26 women who have claimed asylum and been detained since the adults at risk policy came into force and, alarmingly, found that survivors of sexual and gender-based violence are still routinely detained.",3
"Many had experience of domestic violence, forced marriage, female genital mutilation and forced prostitution and trafficking.",3
"Home Office statistics show that, in 2017, 43% of asylum-seeking women leaving detention had been detained for 29 days or more.",3
"Overall, it found that vulnerable women were still being detained, “despite professional evidence of torture, rape and trafficking, and in greater numbers than we have seen at previous inspections” As a result, it concluded that, “the effectiveness of the adults at risk policy, which is intended to reduce the detention of vulnerable people, was questionable”.",3
"Home Office statistics show that, in 2017, 85% of asylum-seeking women released from detention were released back into the community to continue with their asylum claim.",3
There should be a 28-day time limit on immigration detention.,3
"Community-based alternatives for immigration detention, focused on support and engagement, are more effective and less expensive than detention Good practice has been demonstrated by the family returns process, implemented in 2011, following the welcome pledge to end the detention of children, which has reduced by 96%.",3
"My Lords, the Windrush fiasco is the result of Home Office deportation targets.",3
"If officials are given targets and the case before them qualifies on the face of it for deportation, and they are short of their quota for that week or month, how can they be expected to use their discretion to act humanely, even in the face of exceptional humanitarian circumstances?",3
"Of course, illegal immigrants should be pursued, but how can targets for removals be consistent with a compassionate approach to exceptional cases?",3
Its aim is to disrupt the business model of human smuggling as well as the trafficking networks that operate in the central Mediterranean.,3
"The follow-up report considers the progress made by Operation Sophia since then up to July 2017 I have had the honour of serving as chair of the EU External Affairs Sub-Committee, and I extend my thanks to all members of the committee for their expertise and their valuable contributions to the report, to all those who have provided written and oral evidence to the committee, to the committee’s secretariat—Eva George, Julia Ewert, and Lauren Harvey—for their assistance with the inquiry and the preparation of this report, and to Jennifer Martin-Kohlmorgen for preparing for this debate and ably taking over as clerk to the committee I am sure noble Lords will recall last year’s extremely distressing scenes of migrants crammed into unseaworthy boats crossing the Mediterranean.",3
These boats are run by people smugglers and criminal gangs and organisations.,2
"While, due to other global events, we may not have been exposed recently to the continuing trend of people attempting to cross the Mediterranean, we had a stark reminder of them this week, with the Italian Government refusing to grant a charity rescue ship crammed with 629 migrants, among them pregnant women and small children, permission to dock This is very much a live issue.",3
The migrant crisis continues.,2
"The report being debated today considered the timeframe between January and July 2017, in which 84,879 irregular migrants used the Mediterranean route crossing from Libya to Italy.",3
"It is good to observe a perceptible reduction in the number of deaths at sea, but much more work still needs to be done to ensure disruption in trafficking networks, and it is equally important to deter the flow of migrants In these two areas, the report found that the mission had failed.",3
"Once the boats have set sail, it is too late.",3
"As of March 2018, Operation Sophia had apprehended 137 smugglers and neutralised 537 vessels, but witnesses confirmed to our inquiry that the people arrested, “were mainly lower down the food chain in the criminal gangs”, and that, while the smugglers’ business model had been impacted, it had not been broken All future UK and EU action must focus on tackling people smuggling in source and transit countries.",3
"However, in the absence of formal consent from the Libyan Government or a UN Security Council resolution, Operation Sophia has not been able to move to the next crucial steps—that is, to move into Libyan territorial waters and eventually on to Libyan soil As the Government have also remarked in their response to the report, the later stages have the potential to have the greatest impact against the smugglers’ business model.",3
"The Government have told us that planning is under way for a civilian mission in Libya, focusing on the southern land border.",3
"Could the Minister provide the House with updates regarding the current state of planning for these missions We are very concerned about the dangerous conditions and human rights abuses that many migrants continue to face in Libya, and welcome the Government’s work in providing funding through respected NGOs and international bodies to improve those conditions and support voluntary returns from Libya.",3
"What is the Government’s assessment of the current human rights situation in Libya, and how do they see the Libyan Government working with these external bodies in monitoring the welfare of migrants?",3
When does the Minister expect negotiations on the future of UK/EU relationships in the area of common foreign policy and security policy to commence?,3
"Does she agree that it is high time that when we talk about migrants, we see them as people taking on extremely difficult, dangerous journeys for better economic opportunities?",3
"In recent days, the language around and references to migrants have become extremely toxic, but I hope that will start to change.",3
"I remember the efforts that we made through the Foreign Office to look after those migrants in those days—without very much cash, to be quite honest.",3
"I apologise to my colleagues for being critical, but having seen this situation develop over almost 30 years now, I believe that we have a long way to go before we can really help the illegal migrants—which is what they are, be they economic or simply social migrants—to have a better life in their countries of origin I have seen some very successful pieces of work carried out in the Far East, the Middle East and Africa, but it has not been very popular to do.",3
"We should note the generosity of Spain, and Spain may need help from countries which have already dealt with this problem for a long while to deal with the migrants who will come across that very choppy crossing into southern Spain The report clearly shows that the work of border guards must be improved in Libya.",3
Such work also needs to be done in the European countries to which the migrants come.,2
"Therefore, countries receiving illegal migrants need help, as well as the countries from which they come.",2
"There simply is not the knowledge in north-east Nigeria of what a migrant could face, so there is an education role here too.",2
"I hope that the Foreign Secretary’s visit to Libya opened a door for us to do work there, but every Minister—in DfID or the Foreign Office—who deals with Africa has a lot of work to do in the countries from which these illegal immigrants are coming The committee has done an excellent job.",3
"It may have had too ambitious a role, and that is why we see a reduction but not the cessation that people in the European Union really wanted to see So let us be realistic about what can be done and use the skills that the Department for International Development undoubtedly has, through the police, through the army, and through the ability to detect smugglers.",3
"Alongside a people smuggler there is very often a goods smuggler, a drugs smuggler and even people who smuggle plants, insects and animals, all of which are a problem for the receiving countries.",2
"There is a vital role for search and rescue, as tragically this week has again illustrated all too clearly, with the migrant ship trying and failing to dock in Italy.",3
"Indeed, the report describes search and rescue as a “vital humanitarian obligation”, but as the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, and others have pointed out, the stated aim of the Operation Sophia mission is, “contributing to the disruption of the business model of human smuggling and trafficking networks in the Southern Central Mediterranean” It is in that regard that we believe the mission has failed The vast majority of the witnesses we heard from during the inquiry acknowledged that the mission has been inadvertently assisting people smugglers by providing a level of certainty that the people being trafficked across the Mediterranean will be rescued by naval vessels if their boats get into trouble.",3
"So, instead of using stronger wooden boats, all too frequently the people smugglers are now using unseaworthy dinghies, which are often seriously overcrowded, making it extremely unlikely that they will be able to cross this wide and unpredictable stretch of the Mediterranean Sea.",3
"According to the United Nations, in 2015 there were 244 million international migrants globally.",3
Perhaps that is not surprising because Hungary and Italy are two of the EU member states most directly affected by this mass movement of people on their land and sea borders.,3
"However, we in this country have also witnessed migration becoming an increasingly emotive issue, particularly during the EU referendum campaign with those now perhaps notorious posters used by the leave campaign showing boats filled with migrants.",3
"In the context of the UK, there is a certain irony in the same media that encourage myths about migration also campaigning against downstream assistance and development aid for the source countries of this migration My second point is about the people smugglers.",3
"According to the European Migrant Smuggling Centre, in 2015, migrant smuggling networks made between €4.7 billion and €5.7 billion trafficking people to Europe, according to its 2017 report A Syrian colleague and friend of mine has told me stories of how social media are now extensively used by the people smugglers to advertise their services, indicating the latest, safest and most effective routes, with a price list attached.",3
It surely must be possible to trace these people smugglers more effectively and to prosecute those at the top of the chain.,3
Baby Sophia was born on 24 August 2015 on a German frigate to a Somali mother who was rescued alongside another 453 migrants and was named after the German princess of the same name.,3
"The individuals on the boat trying to land in Italy this week, as the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, said, included pregnant women and babies.",3
"Merely hoping that these issues will go away and attempting to pull up the drawbridge will just allow the people smugglers’ business to flourish Sadly, this well-intentioned mission—that is, Operation Sophia—is in reality further assisting these international criminals in exploiting often desperate people in their quest for a better life.",3
"It was a privilege to serve under her and to be on this committee Many years ago, before I became a Member of this House, I worked in the refugee NGO field.",3
"I was a member of an NGO delegation that went round the Caribbean looking at the situation of Haitian refugees, who at that time were fleeing from a very tyrannical regime in Haiti.",3
He then went on to say that a sinking boat of Haitian refugees had tried to approach the harbour.,3
"He told us, “I ordered that boat to be pushed away because I was determined not to have any more Haitians here”.",3
It did not turn boats away; it accepted them and showed humanity.,3
"Maybe Americans are different now but certainly at that time it was remarkable that the whole Caribbean seemed to hate the Haitians and it was only America which provided them with safety and accepted any boats that arrived I tell that story because the history of inhumanity is not new; sadly, it has been there for quite some time.",4
"So perhaps we are not shocked, even if we are dismayed, at what happened to the boat in the Mediterranean that the Italians would not take and that went to Spain.",3
"I was shocked that this should happen and that, if the Spaniards had not said they would take them, those people might have drowned, as so many already have In a wider sense, I like to feel that Europe could move towards a Europe-wide policy on migration and refugees.",3
"As has been said already, Operation Sophia may have saved lives but, paradoxically, it has also made the task of the smugglers easier.",3
"All they have to do now is have an even less seaworthy boat, push it 12 miles offshore, and then get someone to phone up and say, “Help, these people are drowning”.",3
"We have saved a lot of lives but, alas, we have made the situation for the smugglers somewhat easier.",3
"But let us be clear: the naval mission has saved lives, even if the smugglers have also benefited We learned a lot about the abuses of human rights in Libya itself and by the Libyan coastguard.",3
We also learned that people smugglers are operating in Libya—they keep migrants in conditions of servitude and make money out of that as well.,3
"The source countries pleaded for economic help so that their young people would have an economic future in their own countries and would not be forced to make that dangerous journey in the hope of trying to find some way of sustaining themselves There is nothing unworthy about being an economic migrant, but there has to be a higher level of human rights support for people who are fleeing from persecution.",3
I wonder what the Spanish Government are doing with the boat load that has arrived and whether they will try to separate those who have a claim to refugee status under the Geneva convention and those who are simply migrants trying to better themselves.,3
"It is no good telling the economic migrants that they have to go back, unless we do more to ensure that the economics of the source countries are such that people have a decent future.",2
It is quite a challenge to us all to look at people and decide whether they are refugees or not.,2
"I have felt all along that, on issues to do with refugees, it is important that the public understand what we are seeking to do and why, rather than us imposing policies on ordinary people in the street without that understanding.",3
"I have already said that the aim should be for a Europe-wide policy on refugees, even if we are a long way from getting agreement for that.",3
She was saying not that she wanted to turn the boats away but that more help was needed from other European countries.,3
Their policy seems to be: refugees are not our problem and we are interested only in white Christians.,3
"As we have seen in recent days, once the boats have set sail it is too late.",3
"As the noble Baroness said, the first six months of 2017 saw more than 84,000 migrants picked up on the Mediterranean, a 20% increase on the first half of 2016 The stranded rescue ship “Aquarius” has sparked a fresh refugee crisis in Europe.",3
"This will include the renewed asylum and migration fund, which will support member states in three key areas: asylum, legal migration and integration, and countering irregular migration and returns.",3
This is where the EU’s foreign affairs work plays a much larger role.,3
How do Her Majesty’s Government envisage being able to influence any future events similar to this once the country is outside the EU and its formal decision-making structures The government response contained up-to-date figures on the situation.,3
"It cited 110 smugglers apprehended, 475 vessels put beyond use and more than 39,000 people rescued—12,000 of those, as we heard in the debate, by UK assets.",3
The mandate was amended to set up a monitoring mechanism of trainees to ensure the long-term efficiency of the training of the Libyan coastguard; conduct new surveillance activities and gather information on illegal trafficking of oil exports from Libya; and enhance the possibilities for sharing information on human trafficking with member states’ law enforcement agencies.,3
"As the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, highlighted, the committee was concerned, “by reports of serious abuses of the human rights of migrants by the Libyan coastguard” As we have heard, in response, the Minister, Sir Alan Duncan, wrote that the Libyan coastguard, “must be equipped with the skills required to manage search-and-rescue activities properly, which includes respecting human rights.",3
"The government response also blames the political and security conditions in Libya for Operation Sophia not being able to move into its later planned phases The Government have stressed the importance of achieving a new political settlement in Libya to, “create greater security and the governance that is needed if we are to successfully tackle illegal migration” Following last month’s meeting of Libyan leaders in Paris, the Minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said: “There is a window of opportunity for progress in Libya, and we urge all of her leaders to seize it by engaging fully with UN-led efforts to facilitate a more inclusive political settlement” Does the Minister believe that this window of opportunity can bring about change on the ground and at sea during the operation’s current mandate In recent weeks we have seen disagreements between UK and EU negotiators on matters relating to security, defence and information exchange.",3
"Before I do that, I would like to remind the House of the Government’s approach to illegal migration and the situation in the central Mediterranean.",3
"These criminal gangs are responsible for the deaths in the Sahara, the drownings in the Mediterranean and the conditions endured by migrants in Libya, including modern slavery I thought the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, was fair in acknowledging that, while not perfect in all respects, Operation Sophia has saved lives.",3
It has had successes: smugglers can no longer operate with impunity in international waters.,3
"It is not a search and rescue mission, but over 45,000 migrants have been rescued and more than 500 smuggling vessels destroyed As noble Lords know, tackling human trafficking and modern slavery is certainly a priority for the Prime Minister.",3
We are committed to working alongside international partners to address this and the wider challenge of illegal migration.,3
"I was very interested to detect that many of your Lordships share that analysis, because the aim is to reduce illegal migration, tackle criminality and trafficking, and protect the vulnerable by making concerted, co-ordinated interventions at all stages of a potential migrant’s journey.",3
"Our policy complements the EU’s comprehensive approach to migration, which ranges from addressing its root causes in source and transit countries to humanitarian assistance and to tackling the smugglers My noble friend Lady Chalker spoke with great pith, punchiness and authority on that issue of root causes, the countries of origin and how we address these matters.",3
"The programme will be delivered by partners—the International Organization for Migration, UNICEF, the British Red Cross and a consortium of NGOs—and will specifically target vulnerable migrants in west and north Africa, including Libya, as well as communities affected by migration.",3
"More specifically, programme activity will take place in migrant source and transit countries such as Senegal, Gambia, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Libya and Sudan.",3
It will include healthcare and psychosocial support for migrants.,3
"Through the International Organization for Migration, we will also fund urgent humanitarian assistance and protection services for migrants while working to ensure that support is also given to those wishing to return.",3
"Indeed, we have helped migrants wishing to return and reintegrate into their countries of origin as part of our whole-of-route approach.",3
We have also funded communications campaigns to warn potential migrants of the risks and realities of taking the route to Libya.,3
This will help to share intelligence about people smuggling and will support the work of our organised immigration crime task force.,3
"As I said earlier, smuggling gangs no longer operate with impunity in international waters, more than 500 smuggling boats have been put out of action and the number of migrants attempting the journey is falling.",3
"In the first five months of 2018, numbers were more than 70% lower than in the same period in 2017, and we are confident that the involvement of naval vessels through Operation Sophia contributed to this The noble Baroness, Lady Suttie, raised efforts to trace smugglers.",3
"Specifically in relation to Libya, on the Foreign Secretary’s last visit he announced a package of additional support to help Libya deal with the terrorist threat and to tackle illegal migration.",3
"It included an increase in engagement with Libyan law enforcement authorities to tackle organised crime and trafficking, building on the work the UK is already doing with European partners It is also worth noting that Operation Sophia is additionally tasked with the important work of implementing the UN arms embargo on Libya on the high seas.",3
"It is positive that the Libyan coastguard is now better able to rescue migrants at sea, and this is reflected in the reduced numbers of crossings of the central Mediterranean into Italy.",3
"I alluded earlier to the fall in the first five months of this year compared with those of 2017 We are concerned about allegations against the Libyan coastguard, including over the mistreatment of migrants, something that a number of contributors raised.",3
"The current political and security vacuum provides a permissive environment for extremists, including Daesh, as well as criminal gangs trafficking migrants to Europe.",2
"We continue to work closely with EU member states and others to end the conflict and bring the parties together through the UN-led mediation process, and the UN action plan We agree with the committee that action concerning Libya’s southern border should be explored.",3
"EUBAM is mandated to assist the Libyan authorities in the fields of law enforcement, broader criminal justice systems and border management, including reducing pressure on Libya’s southern borders Looking to the future, the EU will release its next strategic review of operations in Libya in the next few months.",3
"We remain committed to supporting stability and economic development in migrants’ countries of origin to reduce the drivers of migration, and we remain committed to supporting United Nations-led efforts to bring peace and stability to Libya, and to building an environment that is no longer conducive to people smugglers, terrorists or criminal gangs Altogether, this will bring benefits not only to the citizens of Libya and of Europe but to potential migrants themselves.",3
I am very proud to be the son of immigrants and proud of this country’s record on supporting refugees and immigrants.,3
The possibility that the Government will accelerate deportation on that basis must be contrary to human rights.,3
"I am very grateful to have the opportunity to bring this issue to the House Like an immigrants, my constituent Alberta came to this country with the dream of a better life.",3
"Arriving in Tottenham from Ghana in 2012, she was a shining example of what migrants contribute to the United Kingdom Alberta was, and still is, a proud and intelligent young woman with dreams, the capacity for hard work and the compulsion to help others on her way up.",3
"When five immigration officers burst open the front door, she was still half naked.",3
"Mortified, she explained to the officers that her five-year immigration permit was still valid.",3
"Victims of rape, torture and trafficking are held inside.",3
"But this was not the end of her suffering at the hands of immigration control While detained in Yarl’s Wood, Alberta missed critical deadlines and her grades dropped rapidly.",3
"To this day, bi-weekly visits to the immigration reporting centre force Alberta to revisit her trauma.",3
"So many others echo these horrors when they recount their experiences of living under immigration control Each year, the Government pay out more than £4 million to people as compensation for having been detained unlawfully.",3
"Alberta’s story illustrates a broken immigration system that treats humans without dignity—a system that stains the fundamental principles of our legal system and our state Over the past year, attention has been drawn to the Government’s hostile environment.",3
"The Windrush scandal revealed that thousands of British citizens were incorrectly deported, detained, made jobless, left without housing and healthcare, split from their families, left destitute and treated like strangers in their homes.",3
"As a member of the United Nations Security Council, we have been a world leader in the spread of human rights and justice, but our treatment of immigrants leaves us no better than the human rights abusers.",2
Government-condoned prejudice permeates every one of an immigrant’s first encounters with the state.,2
"The Home Office imprisons tens of thousands of people every year, including survivors of torture, trafficking and rape, with no time limit.",3
We are the only EU country that allows the indefinite detention of migrants But it is not only this that singles Britain out.,2
We have one of the slowest and least efficient immigration processes in the developed world.,2
"In France, the average stay for detained migrants is just one month.",3
Bail with reporting restrictions and electronic monitoring should surely be considered before we lock migrants up and throw away the keys The brutal treatment of immigrants such as Alberta not only denies them their freedom; it can leave emotional scars that torment them for the rest of their lives.,3
"In every other sphere of British life, innocence is presumed while guilt must be proven, but the legal basis of our immigration system is upside down.",2
So why is legal representation impossible to access for so many under immigration control?,2
There has been a 56% fall in the total number of legal aid providers for asylum seekers since 2005.,3
How can we deport migrants without granting them legal representation?,2
How can we split migrants from their children and partners without giving them access to justice?,3
"How can we pull migrants away from their homes and livelihoods without respecting our own rule of law Our current system is not only cruel, unjustifiable and damaging to the lives of detainees; it is a great burden on the British taxpayer.",2
"What justifies a system that treats the vulnerable as criminals and expects taxpayers to foot the bill For individuals, too, the cost of being trapped under immigration control continues to spiral.",3
"Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald) said in Westminster Hall on Tuesday, the fees for children under immigration control in this country are a particular disgrace.",3
"I understand her claim that the Government need to “balance the books”, but when the Government are intent on keeping taxes low for the richest in society, can flagrant profiteering off the most vulnerable ever be justified Much of the blame for the state of the immigration system in this country lies with this Government and this Prime Minister, who single-handedly coined the “hostile environment” policy.",3
"However, any constructive debate on immigration will recognise that no party—and that absolutely includes my own—has been innocent.",3
The Labour party should also be ashamed of its treatment of people under immigration control during its three terms in power.,3
"With the mutual recognition of past failures, we can begin a cross-party response to heal these wounds, but to do so, we must first clean up the injuries of the past The Home Office’s war against undocumented immigration has built a shadow economy fuelled by workplace exploitation, human trafficking, drugs and other crime.",3
"Some 600,000 people live illegally in the UK, and they will remain here regardless of their legal status.",2
"The question is whether to keep them illegal, fuelling crime and the shadow economy, or to regularise their status, allowing them to pay income tax and national insurance, live safely and become respected members of society.",3
"A one-off immigration amnesty would allow this country to start afresh and to create a new system that respects migrants’ rights and their contribution, while apologising for the mistakes of the past Today, we must recognise that this is a crucial turning point in British history.",3
"The opportunity to reshape our immigration system that comes with it must reflect back on the hostile environment that has routinely abused human rights and brought shame on our nation If we are to build a truly open, global Britain that engages with the world, as the last debate demonstrated, redrawing our immigration policy is a vital part of that.",3
We must continue to attract the talent and hard work of immigrants such as Alberta.,3
"We must look forward to a future with a just immigration policy, motivated by compassion, fairness and the rule of law—an immigration system where migrants are treated like human beings, not criminals When we discuss in this House the trade deals that we will strike with the Chinese and the Indians, let us be honest: the first thing those nations will ask for is the immigration of their citizens to this country.",3
"For all those reasons, it is time to reform cross-party our response to those controlled by immigration in this country.",3
"That is why we need a fair immigration system under which people can come here, be welcomed and become part of our communities, and a fair system that treats people with decency and respect That is why this Government are taking action and will continue to do so.",3
We have changed the law to stop children being routinely detained in the immigration system.,3
"That is why we have broken up the UK Border Agency to make the system more effective, reintroduced exit checks and toughened the penalties for people employing illegal workers.",3
"Migration benefits the UK, but that system has to be underpinned by rules I remain absolutely committed to improving the border, immigration and citizenship system.",3
"The independent chief inspector of borders and immigration continues to scrutinise the border, immigration and citizenship system We are not only implementing the recommendations from Stephen Shaw’s review of detention, but, as my right hon.",3
"As a first step, we intend to pilot a scheme to manage in the community vulnerable women who would otherwise have been detained at Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre.",3
"Home Office officials have been working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to develop that pilot, which will mean that rather than receiving support and care in an immigration removal centre, the women will get a programme of support and care in the community We will review the adults at risk policy, ensuring that the most vulnerable and complex cases get the attention they need.",3
"For now, the policy is one of senior civil servant sign-off for detention decisions, and we will strengthen links with pre-departure teams by putting additional Home Office people in removal centres to increase face-to-face engagement with detainees and resolve possible problems with detention We will commission the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration to report each year on whether and how the adults at risk policy is making a difference.",3
We will pilot the use of Skype so that detainees can contact their families overseas and in the UK.,3
"Friend the Home Secretary has asked officials to review how time limits work in other countries, and how they relate to other protections in their detention systems, so as to have a better-informed debate based on what works to tackle illegal migration and what is humane for those detained.",3
"Member for Tottenham that the Government currently manage 95% of those in the removal pool in the community, and of those in immigration removal centres, 63% leave within 28 days and more than 90% within four months.",3
"Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald), in which we discussed immigration fees.",3
"Of course we keep all Home Office fees under regular review, and when setting immigration and nationality fees, which are approved by Parliament in line with the Immigration Act 2014, we take into account the wider costs involved in running our border, immigration and citizenship system, so that those who directly benefit from it contribute to its funding.",3
"That reduces the burden on UK taxpayers I am carefully considering points made during a recent debate in the Lords on child citizenship fees, and in other debates held this week, and in due course I will take account of the findings of the imminent review by the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration.",3
It is important that we have a fair charging policy that considers a customer’s circumstances and requirements and supports the effective operation of our immigration system.,3
"We will continue to set fees that take into account the benefits accruing from a successful application, for example across the labour market Now more than ever, we are listening to independent advice, developing policy that is rooted in evidence and taking feedback from customers to ensure that we continue to have a world-leading border, immigration and citizenship system, and that those subject to immigration control are provided with the appropriate service.",3
"Member for Tottenham and others are right to bring matters to my attention, but I remind the House of the scale of the immigration system.",3
"Thousands of decisions are made every day, and the overwhelming majority are completed within published service standards and enable people to visit the UK, study or work here, or rebuild their lives UK Visas and Immigration offices make more than 3 million decisions a year, and the Border Force enables 250 million people to cross our border while keeping our country safe and secure.",3
"Immigration Enforcement ensures that 95% of individuals who require leave to remain, but do not have it because they have overstayed their visa or are not eligible to have it extended, are managed in the community and receive guidance on departure I am not complacent, but I list those achievements because they are not insignificant.",3
"For every case in which I have conceded that the system could have done better, and must do better in future, there are thousands more people who are satisfied with their experience of the immigration system.",3
"For us, the Jews were a positive example of what immigrants can achieve by integrating fully into society.",3
During the Second World War it was this country that took in Jewish refugees and offered them a safe haven.,4
"Would they question the legality of practically the whole of Europe, the borders of which were shaped, destroyed and redrawn through centuries of war?",3
"There are phrases such as, “Zionists controlling the media, financial institutions and foreign policy”, It is not long before you find yourself in Holocaust-denial or blood-libel territory.",3
"All Members will have seen the recent heart-breaking stories of individuals who have been in this country for decades struggling to navigate an immigration system in a way that they should never, ever have had to.",3
"Since 1973 many of the Windrush generation would have obtained documentation confirming their status or would have applied for citizenship and then a British passport From the 1980s, successive Governments have introduced measures to combat illegal immigration.",3
The first NHS treatment charges for overseas visitors and illegal migrants were introduced in 1982.,3
"Checks by employers on someone’s right to work were first introduced in 1997, measures on access to benefits in 1999 and civil penalties for employing illegal migrants in 2008.",3
"The most recent measures in the immigration Acts of 2014 and 2016 introduced checks by landlords before property is rented and checks by banks on account holders The public expect us to enforce the Immigration Rules approved by Parliament as a matter of fairness for those who abide by the rules, and I am personally committed to tackling illegal migration because I have seen in this job its terrible impact on some of the most vulnerable in our society.",3
"However, these steps intended to combat illegal migration have had an unintended and sometimes devastating impact on people from the Windrush generation, who are here legally but have struggled to get the documentation to prove their status.",3
"Some people will have indefinite leave to remain, which means they cannot leave the UK for more than two years and are not eligible for a British passport.",3
"That is the main reason why we have seen the distressing stories of people leaving the UK more than a decade ago and not being able to re-enter I want to enable the Windrush generation to acquire the status that it deserves—British citizenship—quickly, at no cost and with proactive assistance through the process.",3
"First, I will waive the citizenship fee for anyone in the Windrush generation who wishes to apply for citizenship.",3
"That is why, going forward, I will be establishing a new customer contact centre, so that anyone who is struggling to navigate the many different immigration routes can speak to a person and get the appropriate advice.",3
"I will also be putting in place 50 senior caseworkers across the country to ensure that, where more junior members of staff are unsure about a decision, they can speak to someone with experience to ensure that discretion is properly exercised There has also been much concern about whether the Home Office has wrongly deported anyone from the Windrush generation.",3
I am now checking all Home Office records going back to 2002 to verify that no one has been deported in breach of this policy.,3
"I will ensure that the House is informed of any updates, and I intend to have this data independently audited once my department has completed its work, to ensure transparency It was never the intention that the Windrush generation should be disadvantaged by measures put in place to tackle illegal migration.",3
"A Minister or Ministers have to accept responsibility The Government’s hostile environment for illegal immigrants was badly designed and put together, with no thought given to how to ensure that people who are here legally would be protected and not caught up in that environment.",3
"People here legally should not be at risk of losing their jobs, driving licences or homes or be threatened with deportation.",2
They are still at risk of deportation from the country that has been their home for decades.,2
"That part of the Statement seems very confused I agree that it was never the intention that the Windrush generation should be disadvantaged by measures put in place to tackle illegal immigration; but they were, because of poor implementation and development of policy at the Home Office by Ministers.",3
"The position of the Windrush people—citizens who seem retrospectively to have become migrants—is a symptom, not a cause, of the problem.",3
"The cause, as we see it, is the culture within the Home Office, an attitude that one cannot avoid saying must come from the top: hostility or compliance—which seems to be the substitute term now—and certainly carelessness, by which I mean “care-less”, as in lacking in care That seems to be why every immigration lawyer to whom I have spoken says that the first thing they do is ask the Home Office what information it has on their client, because so often they find that it is wrong.",3
"The Minister will not be surprised by this: it is why I sought to remove the Home Office exemption from the Data Protection Bill, which can be applied in the interests of effective immigration control—a matter others are now pursuing.",3
"Again, may we have details Thirdly, what information will the Home Office publish so that we can see the whole picture systematically, rather than as a series of individual stories, and not just about deportations This affects many, many people.",3
"Another manifestation is immigration detention, to which people unable to prove their status have been consigned Immigrants might be legal, they might be illegal or perhaps they cannot prove their status, so the Home Office makes an assumption, if not a presumption, that they have no rights.",3
"I feel bound to say that someone in the Home Office should have taken the trouble to read the debate on Windrush that we had in Grand Committee on 18 January, when I first raised the question of Paulette Wilson and Anthony Bryan, both of whom had been threatened with deportation.",3
I should like the Minister to confirm that the culture inside the Home Office and the immigration department will change as a result of the Home Secretary’s statement yesterday.,3
There are terrible reports of immigration officers playing a game in which they catch people in what is known as a “Gotcha culture”.,3
"When they think they have found an illegal immigrant, they mark it up as a victory.",3
"Also, can we now begin to have a proper debate on and give full recognition to the importance we attach to the immigrants among us?",3
"We are all immigrants in one way or another, so we should move away from the blame culture and xenophobic attitude which is colouring so much of our public debate.",2
"The audacious idea of European integration was motivated by fear, but it was made possible by shared ideals—democracy, human rights, equality and freedom—and a refusal to submit to the tyranny of fascism ever again After the second world war, Winston Churchill said in 1946: “If Europe were once united in the sharing of its common inheritance there would be no limit to the happiness, prosperity and glory” Today, however, some Conservative colleagues talk about total independence from Europe as though it were a virtue.",3
"What does it say about Britain when our politicians play on the fear of migrants, races and religions to win votes?",3
"What did it say when Nigel Farage stood in front of a Nazi-inspired poster of refugees with the caption, “Breaking point” The founder of the Labour party, Keir Hardie, spoke of socialism’s “promise of freedom”, its “larger hope for humanity” and of “binding the races of the earth into one all-embracing brotherhood” I honestly ask my good friends in the party who are still wavering: can you really vote for this politics of division and hate?",3
"Can you vote to hand over more power to the clumsy hand of the market What I am about to say is not fashionable, but our country’s story of renewal through Europe is one of immigration.",3
European migrants are not “citizens of nowhere” or “queue jumpers” as the Prime Minister would have us believe.,3
"Over their lifetimes, they will pay in £78,000 more than they take out The contribution of European migrants has not been just financial.",3
It forgets the value of immigrants.,3
"It is worth quoting it for the record: “A new Russian law, adopted earlier in the year, formally permits the extrajudicial killings abroad of those Moscow accuses of ‘extremism’...In July, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament—the Federation Council—approved a law which permits the Russian president to use the country’s armed forces and special services outside Russia’s borders to combat terrorism and extremism At the same time, amendments to several other laws, governing the security services, mass media and communications, were adopted The overall result was to dramatically expand those defined as terrorist or extremist Along with those seeking to overthrow the Russian government, the term is also applied to ‘those causing mass disturbances, committing hooliganism or acts of vandalism’ Much more controversially, the law also defines ‘those slandering the individual occupying the post of president of the Russian federation’ as extremists”, so those who insult the President of Russia can legally be killed overseas according to this law.",3
"According to him, its break-up was the greatest disaster of the 20th century—a revealing and curious choice when compared with the millions killed in two world wars, the Russian civil war, the forced collectivisations, the mass deportations and the hell of the gulag Until the Bolshevik revolution, there was some chance of Russia evolving along democratic lines, but then the cancer of Marxism-Leninism gave psychopaths and dictators their ideological excuse to seize total control.",3
"The disgraceful chemical attack in Salisbury—which I believe is a slightly longer train ride from East Renfrewshire than from Taunton Deane—is a particularly shocking example of the Russian Government’s habit of acting without respect for national borders or international rules and norms Russia has acted in this way for a long time, growing bolder, escalating, and interfering further and further beyond its own borders.",3
"The ethnic Georgians who have remained in those areas have been denied access to education in their native language, denied freedom of movement within the rest of Georgia, forced to change their names and ethnic identity and compelled to register as “foreigners” in their own land.",3
"It recognised, and established military bases in, the separatist republics, which remain rightly unrecognised by the United Kingdom Government and by the overwhelming majority of the international community Since then, the separatist republics have become more and more integrated with Russia.",3
The people who still live there largely use Russian passports as a result of illegal and forceful mass passportisation.,2
"On 18 March, the Russian presidential elections were held in the occupied territories, and 33 polling stations were illegally opened.",3
"The territories that are being occupied by Russia are integral parts of Georgia, and they should be returned to Georgia Putin’s disrespect for international norms does not stop a certain distance from Russia’s borders.",3
"My Lords, in this country we allow, quite rightly, UK passport holders to be in the possession of passports of other countries—not just one but two or three; whatever is needed.",4
"When someone applies for a UK passport, they are required to declare what other passports they hold.",4
"But, astonishingly, this information is not kept in any sort of central database and still less is it available to border officers whose responsibility it is to examine the passports of those entering or leaving the UK.",3
"This is why my noble friend the Minister had to tell me, in a Written Answer on 16 April this year, when I asked about a register of second passports: “No statistical information is available showing whether British citizens hold another citizenship” About five years ago I was tipped off by a member of the Security Service that its operations were made much more difficult by the fact that UK citizens were using their UK passport to travel to one destination and then another passport to get up to mischief, perhaps, in third countries.",3
She expressed astonishment that border control officers were not automatically alerted to other passports held when a UK passport was electronically scrutinised at the point of entry.,3
"It asks merely that the Government require dual nationals to declare other passports and that this information, “should be made available to border security staff and other relevant national authorities via a centralised database” In fact, it is even more modest because all I am asking them to do is to study whether this is a sensible idea.",3
"My answer to that is that such a concept of civil liberties is wholly outdated in an age when we are all subject to intense and often intrusive surveillance by foreign powers such as Russia and, rather more efficiently, China.",3
The second is that there could be no way of enforcing the declaration of other passports.,3
"That of course has a simple remedy, which is—if it is declared to be deliberate and pernicious—the forfeiture of a UK passport when that is discovered.",3
Noble Lords in the Committee might have their own view on this but I am quite sure that the great majority of second passport holders would have not the slightest objection to this being known to the authorities.,3
"After all, we all have to put up with a lot of inconvenient baggage examination under existing counterterrorism operations Nor should we neglect the possibility of connivance by Home Office staff in committing terrorist or other serious criminal offences, whether in connection with passports or border control.",3
"In a recent case Shamsu Iqbal, an official in the immigration department of the Home Office, was sentenced in April to 15 years for misconduct in public office.",3
"Sometimes this connivance involves selling visas or trafficking in passports, assisting illegal immigration, forgery, bribery, money laundering and other serious matters.",3
"I suggest that the Home Office really cannot argue that we can rely on its existing standards of efficiency, let alone integrity, in the protection of our borders The third argument is that we should have confidence in the Home Office’s intelligence-led processes and not concern ourselves with these matters.",3
"I share his aim of preventing those who may be of interest on the grounds of terrorism, serious crime or hostile activity from avoiding detection at the border.",3
"That is not my experience and it is certainly not the experience of my noble friend the Minister or, I dare say, any of your Lordships in this House who have had dealings with the Home Office Holding dual national status is perfectly lawful in the UK and it is not a barrier to acquiring British citizenship or obtaining a British passport.",4
"When making such applications, dual nationals are required to provide the Home Office with details of any foreign passports or other nationality held.",3
"Such information will assist in the assessment of the application, including, in the case of an application for naturalisation, the assessment of any grounds for refusal based upon conduct through past or present activities The request for dual national passport information is also necessary in understanding whether a person is using one name for all official purposes.",3
"The UK, through the Home Office, has also instituted a policy that a person must have one name for all official purposes and that this is reflected in biometric residence permits, naturalisation and registration documents and passports.",3
"This, together with other measures in place, minimises the ability of a British citizen to manipulate travel documents to travel in to and out of the UK and other countries undetected for terrorism, trafficking and other criminal activities.",3
"Currently, the Kolpak rule applies to those players who hold an EU passport, who are married to an EU or EEA national, or who come under the Kolpak ruling.",4
"These players are not currently classified as foreign, and that is recognised in the quota system used by professional sports in the United Kingdom.",4
"Governing bodies such as the RFU, which has the responsibility for issuing endorsements to rugby union players outside the EU and EEA, have stated that they cannot even look at their regulations regarding overseas players until the terms of Brexit have been confirmed.",3
"Another example is the Cotonou agreement, a treaty between the EU and a group of states including South Africa, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, whose rugby players could, at present, play for a British-based team and not count towards the foreign player quota Without membership of the EU, the Kolpak rule goes.",3
Will every athlete with current citizenship in one of the EU or EEA membership states require a work permit?,4
"The Chancellor, Philip Hammond—whose view on Brexit, incidentally, I totally endorse—stated that there was no likelihood that new immigration controls would apply to highly skilled and highly paid workers.",3
On another day we will debate our asylum system for those who seek protection once they are here.,3

New Zealand is considering a humanitarian visa category for people displaced by climate change.,3
"Thank you for calling me to speak, Mr Deputy Speaker; I am glad to see you back in the Chair I will start by sharing with the House the case brought to me by the Leeds Asylum Seekers Support Network, a charity that works tirelessly to support asylum seekers in Leeds and for which I used to be a short-stop host for asylum seekers who were destitute.",3
This was a story that LASSN had heard many times before—a textbook case of trafficking.,3
"Because of her unclear immigration status, no social or homelessness services could take her and keep her safe.",3
"To their great credit, they did not arrest Akifa for illegal entry to the UK, but instead took her to a place of safety, which was a great relief as arrest was a very real possibility Akifa was Eritrean.",3
"That is because, unlike military conscription, boys and girls aged 16-plus are often expected to serve indefinitely, with many refugees equating conscription to a life sentence of forced labour Physical abuse, including torture, occurs frequently, as does forced domestic servitude and sexual violence by commanders against female conscripts.",3
"The judiciary is subject to Executive control and the constitution is unimplemented UNHCR reported 475,000 Eritreans globally to be refugees and asylum seekers—that is 12% of the population—yet the UK policy has been to pass the buck to countries already facing problems of their own, shirking our own responsibility under international law.",3
The case of Akifa and Eritrea presents a broad problem with British refugee policy.,3
"The refugee crisis is bigger than Britain, but we can work with the UNHCR and other organisations to fulfil our moral, legal and human obligations.",3
"The Government welcome such a heartfelt parliamentary debate on subjects as topical as conflict prevention, climate change and the protection of inalienable human rights.",3
"In the context of today’s debate, it may be helpful for Members to know that it will include a section on migrants To achieve the maximum impact, we are prioritising our human rights efforts in a number of specific areas, including promoting girls’ education, tackling modern slavery and promoting and defending freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression and freedom from all aspects of discrimination.",3
"Friend the Prime Minister has made combating modern slavery, which has an intentional impact on some of the most vulnerable of our fellow human beings, one of the UK’s top foreign policy priorities.",3
"That is why she convened world leaders at the UN General Assembly in September to launch a call to action to end forced labour, modern slavery and human trafficking.",3
That is why climate change remains a foreign policy priority.,2
"Throughout, we have heard moving testimony about the situation facing many hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees fleeing violence in Burma in recent months.",3
"Since 28 December, the UK’s pledge of some £59 million has helped to fund an emergency medical team of 40 doctors, nurses and midwives, paramedics and firefighters, who have been deployed to the frontline of the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, to help to combat the diphtheria outbreak In my role as FCO Minister for Asia, I remain persistent in our lobbying the Government of Burma to allow the Rohingya back to their homeland with sufficient guarantees on security and, importantly, on citizenship that they will be able to rebuild their lives.",3
"If the returns are to be genuinely voluntary, there must be a consultative process to establish the refugees’ intentions and concerns.",3

"Resolved, That this House believes that conflict resolution, climate change and the protection of human rights should be at the heart of UK foreign policy and that effective action should be taken to alleviate the refugee crisis and calls on the Government to lead international efforts through the United Nations and other international organisations to ensure that human rights are protected and upheld around the world.",3
"Back in 2012, Theresa May said: “The aim is to create here in Britain a really hostile environment”, for illegal immigrants.",3
"This was at a point when net immigration was running at about 250,000—well above the Conservative Party’s target of bringing it down to the tens of thousands.",3
"Over the course of Mrs May’s tenure at the Home Office, this usually cautious politician brought forward seven pieces of immigration legislation and an estimated 45,000 changes to immigration rules—so many we might have been forgiven for thinking that immigration was an obsession.",3
It also explains why many foreign EU nationals are so disbelieving of Prime Minister May’s promises about preserving their residency rights post Brexit I fully expect the Minister to repeat a point she made to me in a Written Parliamentary Question: that the term “hostile environment” originated during Alan Johnson’s tenure as Home Secretary.,3
"In April this year, the Oxford Migration Observatory estimated that some 57,000 Commonwealth migrants from Pakistan, India, Kenya and South Africa might be caught by the policy.",3
"Refugee Action reports that the detention, destitution, homelessness and limbo experienced by Windrush children were the tip of the iceberg and that asylum seekers face exactly the same problems Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer, has described the effect of the policy well.",3
"He says that it has led to, “the creation of an illegal underclass of foreign, mainly ethnic minority workers and families who are highly vulnerable to exploitation and who have no access to the social and welfare … net” Rachel Krys of the End Violence Against Women Coalition speculated that while rightly the public were outraged by the policy impact on the Windrush generation: “The same policy is also leaving many women at risk of violence and exploitation, scaring them away from seeking help, and making it harder for them to access life-saving services” This cannot be right, but it is exactly what the policy was supposed to achieve: to create such a hostile environment so that people simply left the UK.",3
"I suspect that, by that time, Amber Rudd realised that the target covered operations that wrongly deported people, falsely detained them, increased their vulnerability and was probably unlawful—most of its victims were in the UK quite lawfully The Government must now regret the day that they dreamed up the expression “hostile environment”.",3
"In the wake of the Windrush scandal, the policy of being tough on anyone deemed illegal, or without documents proving citizenship, has rapidly unravelled, and so it should.",3
"So to adopt the term to be used as a policy relating to immigration, where race plays a part, is even more awful.",3
"It seems to me that it was dreamed up as part of the Cameron response to UKIP, to somehow demonstrate that this Government were getting a grip on the ridiculous target they set to bring immigration down to the tens of thousands.",3
"Migration and asylum targets are notoriously hard to hit because so many factors are involved in driving the numbers Weirder still, of course, was the mobile billboard campaign of 2013 that came with the adoption of the policy.",3
"The Home Office enforcement of right to rent, through its immigration compliance and enforcement teams, gained entry to more than 10,000 properties but made referrals to the civil penalties compliance team in only 3% of cases.",3
"He said that, overall, the right to rent scheme, “had yet to demonstrate its worth as a tool to encourage immigration compliance” In fact, the number of voluntary returns had fallen over the period.",3
"As the United Nations special rapporteur, Professor Tendayi Achiume, observed in May 2018, the hostile environment policy was, “destroying the lives and livelihoods of … ethnic minority communities”, including people with rightful citizenship status and those who had been in the UK for decades.",3
"They could, when they eventually brought forward an immigration Bill, set themselves the task of promoting fairness in the system without playing at dog-whistle politics or trying to appease the politics of social division and racism.",3
"The UN special rapporteur recommended that, “the Government repeal the aspects of its immigration law … that deputize immigration enforcement to private citizens”, and make public officials responsible for policing immigration rules in providing health and other public services.",3
"Perhaps she could tell us where we have got to with the compensation scheme Finally, given the welcome hints of change in the offing, can the Minister update us on the position of tier 2 visa applicants and shortage professions?",3
"I know that the Royal College of General Practitioners has raised this issue and has identified cases of trainees being threatened with deportation—this, when we are light of some 5,000 GPs, is a form of public service self-harm To conclude, I am pleased to have had the opportunity to highlight this most shameful of public policies.",3
"I came to the UK from Jamaica in 1954, aged 16, and am classed as a member of the Windrush generation of migrants from the Commonwealth who arrived between 1948 and 1971.",4
"Many of the earlier migrants had been among the 10,000 members of the British Armed Forces in the Second World War.",3
"They are all British citizens, and many have subsequently been branded as illegal by the Home Office What led us to this?",3
"As British citizens from a British colony, the adults had British passports and the children travelled on a parent’s or sibling’s passport.",4
"Many of those passports were lost as the years rolled past, so parents and children had no documentation showing their arrival.",3
"The problems began when a new immigration Act was passed in 2012 which required people to have documentation to prove they were here legally in order to work, rent a property or access benefits, including healthcare.",3
Some were deported.,3
"To prove to the Home Office that they had a right to live in the UK, they had to produce four pieces of evidence for every year of residence, or they faced deportation.",3
They had fallen foul of laws that we are told were intended to catch illegal immigrants.,3
"For those citizens, home became a place that they knew not In 2004 Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the so-called open-door policy that increased immigration from eastern Europe.",3
"When David Cameron took over as Prime Minister, he promised to cut immigration numbers, and illegal immigrants were the first target that he aimed at.",3
"When Mrs May became Home Secretary in 2010 and set about making a big reduction in the net migration numbers, her attempts did not always work The 2013 promise of a “hostile environment”, about which we have already heard, may have been for illegal immigrants but it was soon to be for everyone, including legal immigrants.",3
"Reduced numbers of Home Office staff had to navigate through some 45,000 changes to immigration rules made during Mrs May’s tenure at the Home Office.",3
"Challenges were difficult because legal aid was almost unavailable, and some people bankrupted themselves fighting deportation.",3
"Where is the logic, the common sense, the compassion Will immigration policy and the practice of those policies change?",3
"In the meantime, visa applications even from doctors and nurses were being denied, despite their having contracts with health authorities, yet because of staff shortages, around two-thirds of NHS trusts spent £l.46 billion on agency nurses in 2017 The new Home Secretary has announced a rethink of immigration policies, rejecting the “hostile environment”.",3
"Speaking during her trip to the G7 summit, though, the Prime Minister rejected calls for a rethink on policies to curb illegal immigration that have trapped British citizens and many more.",3
"She insisted that she had the public’s backing for measures that have turned employers, landlords, the NHS and banks into de facto border guards.",3
All of those are required to make a contribution to the hostile environment I wish the new Home Secretary well in the hope that he will bring some sanity and compassion to our immigration policies.,3
"The appropriate spouse visa was issued, at significant cost, and a health surcharge was paid; again, not a small amount.",3
"Both husband and wife have master’s degrees—exactly the kind of people this country needs to be a success in the future Under current rules, a spouse visa lasts for two and a half years and then an extension spouse visa must be applied for, again at considerable cost and with another health surcharge.",3
"The extension visa lasts for another two and a half years, after which the applicant is able to apply for permanent leave to remain, again at considerable cost and with another health surcharge.",3
"This particular applicant has just been through the spouse extension visa application, which seems to me to have been a pointless but quite damaging process.",3
"Let me explain why The Home Office website advises that an application to extend a spouse visa should not be made more than 28 days before the existing visa runs out, yet the Home Office’s own target average processing time for such a visa is eight weeks.",3
"Therefore, on average, following all the advice of the Home Office, the applicant is likely to experience what I will call a limbo period of four weeks after the original visa has expired but before the new visa is issued.",3
The website also says that interviews can be held at certain offices around the country to speed up the issuing of the spouse extension visa.,3
"However, because of falling into the limbo period, the applicant was unable to travel—the Home Office still had the passport and had not issued the extension visa—and so missed the wedding, where I understand a good time was had by all but there were mutterings over the visa-issuing process.",3
"Needless to say, in the week after the family wedding the passport and renewed visa arrived on the last day of the eighth week since application The Minister may recall that I have tabled several Parliamentary Questions recently.",3
"On 14 May I asked: “Why an applicant for a spouse extension visa may not apply more than 28 days before the expiry of their current visa when the standard processing time … for someone resident in the UK is eight weeks” The Minister replied on 22 May: “The requirement to submit a spouse extension application no earlier than 28 days before the expiry of existing leave is advisory, not mandatory.",3
"I also asked: “what advice they give to applicants if they need to make international travel after their visa has expired but before their renewal visa has been granted” The Minister replied: “Applicants are advised when applying not to make any non-urgent … travel arrangements until their passports or travel documents are returned to them, followed by their Biometric Residence Permit if their application is successful” She went on to say: “Applicants can request the urgent withdrawal of their application for international travel.",3
They would then have to apply for entry clearance from overseas to return to the UK” So you go to a Greek island to attend a wedding and spend most of the time there applying for leave to come back to the UK.,4
"However, because of the “Windrush” publicity, potential employers were deterred from offering employment because the Home Office had the passport and they did not want a potential “illegal” on their books.",3
"So there was an interruption to the applicant’s contribution to the UK economy Out of the blue, a telephone call was made offering employment carrying out recovery work on one of the UK’s overseas territories because the applicant had the correct qualifications and experience to do the job.",3
Noble Lords will be aware of the damage caused in some overseas territories by the Caribbean hurricanes last year.,3
"Unfortunately, that opportunity had to be turned down because under the law as it stands anyone holding a spouse visa is not allowed to spend more than a certain number of days outside the UK, otherwise a subsequent application for permanent leave to remain will be refused.",3
Why does it take eight weeks to process a routine application for a spouse extension visa?,3
How much of the high fee charged is actually incurred in the processing of these visas?,3
Why is a spouse extension visa needed at all?,3
Why cannot the applicant apply for permanent leave to remain instead of having to apply for another two-and-a-half year visa?,3
"Further, will the Minister look at the rules on the number of days an applicant can be out of the country, particularly if they have been invited to help in the UK overseas territories, which after all are technically British Yesterday I received an email from a project worker in the organisation Just for Kids Law.",3
The project worker points out in her email that: “Most of us have to go through a 10-year process of applying and repeatedly renewing our immigration status.,3
"Since 2014, the limited leave to remain fees we have to pay every 30 months to keep our immigration status up-to-date have increased from £601 to £1,033 excluding NHS surcharge of £500.",3
"With no legal aid … many of us are struggling to keep our heads above water” She goes on: “Because of this, we are calling for a government review of the impact of spiralling fees on lawful young migrants.",3
"We would like to see an immediate freeze of limited leave to remain fees and, ultimately, a shorter and affordable route to citizenship.",3
The recent Windrush scandal has shone a light on an immigration system that is broken” There are many trouble spots in the world and the UK has a good record over the centuries of responding to the needs of those at risk.,3
"When asked what was currently bugging him, he said: “The global insensitivity to the most vulnerable people among us in the world: the refugees displaced by war, climate change, and the hatred of others.",3
"In so doing, I will look at the assumptions and attitudes we have brought to bear on this question of immigration The “Empire Windrush” story is not new.",3
We hear stories of people who owed HMRC only £1 or £2 who have been deported or threatened with deportation Why is there this kind of attitude?,3
"From what soil does this kind of attitude to our fellow human beings, now labelled as illegal immigrants, spring?",3
"In the course of doing so I will certainly talk about a few of the contemporary situations I think we will all agree that, unless there are reasons to the contrary, unlawful immigrants should not be here.",3
That is what we have allowed to happen in the case of unlawful immigration.,2
"We convince ourselves that these illegal immigrants are a national threat, a danger to the country, an enemy within—people coming from outside taking over our country.",2
The benefit system has been capped to find out illegal immigrants.,3
We threaten people with deportation and detention.,2
"We look at their bank accounts to see whether any illegal transactions are taking place In the course of using those powers to try to achieve this kind of goal, inevitably mistakes are made—they are bound to be.",3
Not only that but small derelictions become very large—they get magnified in our views and become subjects for deportation.,2
"Small mistakes are made, different papers presented and someone is ready to be deported or detained.",3
"A few days later a message was sent asking if it should be diverted to east Africa, which was part of our empire, where all those on the boat could be given jobs.",3
The Labour Party came around and followed a policy of controlling immigration and anti-racist legislation I should not go on too long.,3
"Let us agree that with regard to the “Empire Windrush” and other cases, we have resorted to a policy of catching illegal immigrants.",3
"The way in which we have done so has caught some illegal immigrants, but what have been the larger consequences?",2
"First, some legal immigrants have been identified and punished.",3
"Secondly, the country’s sensibility has become very coarse, such that if a man is branded as illegal, anything goes, anything can be done to him.",3
"Thirdly, because we talk about illegal immigrants, all immigrants get marked in this way and that accounts for the populist reaction that we have been witnessing, not only in Britain but everywhere else.",3
"Where people feel so possessive about the country, then the figure of the immigrant, not just the illegal immigrant, becomes a dangerous one, something to watch against.",2
"As soon as someone is identified as an immigrant, people will say, “Oh, my God, lock him up, send him away”.",3
"Those of us who read newspapers in other countries feel deeply saddened that a country we love should be represented in this way as a country which is prepared to denigrate its own citizens, deport them and detain them.",3
"I do not think the Conservative Party is particularly keen on compassion, so I will not say let us take a compassionate attitude to immigration; instead, let us take a realistic attitude to illegal immigration.",3
What would a realistic attitude to illegal immigration be?,2
"Oh, come on The other important thing is that they come here because we have messed up their countries through our foreign policy and they are in a situation where their lives are unliveable.",2
They come illegally because they would like to come legally but we have closed the legal door.,2
Illegal immigration takes place because legal immigration has been blocked.,2
"So I do not think we should simply blame the villain out there, in the form of an illegal immigrant; we should also look at ourselves and our policies with some degree of modesty and humility and ask ourselves whether we are responsible for what is going on.",2
I do not think the Minister would want to say that we have no responsibility of any kind for the illegal immigration that is taking place I want to alert noble Lords to something.,3
I was at one stage very closely involved in the case of an Iranian who was seeking asylum in this country.,4
"Fortunately, there was a very astute and on-the-ball lawyer from a Newcastle firm, who had done a lot of work on immigration and who produced within minutes the receipt from the Home Office showing that the documents had been received.",3
These things worry me profoundly The term “illegal immigrants” always intrigues me because it was not very many years ago that a leading government Minister in this country said in relation to those in deprived areas that the hero in society was the one who got on their bike and cycled off to find and build a future for their children.,3
"We categorise and try to compartmentalise the whole issue of immigration in a way that is just not tenable, because all the dimensions overlap each other As we struggle with our own challenges in this society, we should never forget that there are between 65 million and 70 million refugees and displaced people in the world; 21.3 million are recognised as refugees.",2
"In the context of the Middle East, where we are deeply disturbed by the issues that prevail, we should remember that Lebanon has 1.1 million refugees, Turkey has 2.5 million and Jordan has between 660,000 and 700,000.",3
"If I was asked to take just one issue in which the imperative of international co-operation and working closely together with other Governments and countries is so important and so obvious, it is the realm of migration and immigration.",2
"The noble Lord, Lord Parekh, if I heard him aright, referred to a national psychosis The policy impinges on people who never expected to be affected by immigration policy.",3
"If your son’s Brazilian fiancée has not previously had a problem with renewing her visa but is not issued a new visa, reports to the Home Office as she is requested to do, and is immediately sent into immigration detention, the whole family is confused, distressed and helpless.",3
"If you are below the financial threshold to sponsor a spouse visa, your Canadian wife—who, from time to time, comes as a visitor—may one day be told, “We don’t believe you’ll leave”, although there has been nothing to suggest that she would break her previous pattern, so she is sent into detention and then back home, if that is where she feels home is by this stage.",3
The business community constantly reminds us that immigration really affects access to talent.,2
"If your aunt has bequeathed you her flat and you have become an accidental landlord, you will find that you are also an immigration officer and subject to sanctions as well Noble Lords will understand that I am using examples, all of which I have come across along with many more over some years.",3
"We are discovering what has happened to the Windrush generation, although we do not yet know how many have been deported or detained, or about the financial and emotional cost to them.",3
"I am talking about the exploitation of people who do not know their rights and think that they may be here illegally, which happens all too often in low-paid employment.",2
"There is a danger that hostility as a policy is reflected across the community, with ethnicity a proxy for racism I recently raised the apparent blanket ban on asylum seekers accessing education.",3
The Minister gave assurances that the Home Office is taking proactive steps to contact those affected and reissue the necessary immigration bail forms without these restrictions.,3
I was grateful for her prompt response and evident understanding but I am told by solicitors that they are still seeing asylum seekers being restricted from studying.,3
"They are also concerned that the new bail guidance does not ensure that potential victims of trafficking, individuals served with deportation orders and those with fresh claims pending will not be unlawfully or irrationally restricted from studying “Hostile” or “compliant”, whatever language is used there has been no change in the legislation.",3
"Just as being taken into detention can come out of the blue so can release, but without asylum support, accommodation or access to benefits.",3
"As the report says: “Expecting someone to engage with their asylum case after release is unrealistic if they are battling mental health issues, receiving no … support, and subject to enforcement-based alternatives to detention, like reporting” As part of the Shaw review, Mary Bosworth identified some consistent findings.",3
"I found no energy, no power” A British Red Cross staff member is also quoted in the report: “I wonder how someone is going to be able to manage going into a workplace and being an integrated part of society”— we seek integration, after all— “when … on your arrival into the country and through the asylum process”, they experienced, “this sense of being done to.",3
This is a very topical debate focusing on the hostile environment policy towards illegal immigration impacting on those with residency and employment rights.,2
"The scandalous treatment of Windrush generation citizens from the Caribbean and other parts of the Commonwealth shames our country, has done huge reputational damage and has hurt people who have every right to be in the United Kingdom Illegal immigration should not be tolerated but the measures here have been applied too bluntly, and people with the legal right to be here and to work and access services are getting caught up in what can be described only as a nightmare for them.",3
Can she also say something about the recent statistics on immigration detentions and returns and tell us the Government’s estimate of the number of people who are in the United Kingdom illegally My noble friend Lord Bassam of Brighton helpfully tabled a Written Question about the number of individuals and families adversely affected by this policy.,3
"What has the Home Office done to improve these figures, because the consequences for people who are wrongly identified as illegal immigrants and are therefore unable to have a bank account are devastating?",3
The Residential Landlords Association pointed out that 42% of its respondents stated that they were less likely to rent to people who did not have a British passport because they feared the criminal sanction if they made a mistake.,3
"There have been mistakes in the data passed to banks and the DVLA and people have been wrongly identified as illegal, with no right to services.",3
"There was little or no evidence that the policy had proved effective in its aims and it had devastating consequences for people wrongly caught up in this hostile environment, who suffered racial and other discrimination, exploitation and homelessness The most tragic thing about this policy is that people who have the right to rent, but who have a foreign passport, limited leave to remain or the correct documents but in a foreign language are the people most likely to be discriminated against.",3
"Can the Minister confirm that the panel is chaired by the Immigration Minister and that the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants are not represented Only last month, the UN special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, while praising some aspects of government policy, found that other policies were affecting ethnic-minority individuals with regular status, “many who are British citizens and who have been entitled to this citizenship as far back as the colonial era” The noble Lord, Lord Jones of Cheltenham, highlighted the fees that immigrants have to pay, and the spiralling fees for children were discussed earlier this week.",3
"The Government have acted in the face of the terrible cases that have come to light, the shameful decisions that were taken, and the people who have lost their homes and jobs and been deported from the country they have called their home.",3
"Millions of visa, citizenship and settlement applications are granted every year, and thousands of people are provided with international protection thanks to the decisions of Home Office case workers.",3
"However, as the Home Secretary has made very clear—a number of noble Lords have alluded to this—as well as having a fair and humane immigration system, as the noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh, said and the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, has just mentioned, we need one that clearly distinguishes between those who are here legally and those who are here illegally, as the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, very articulately pointed out.",3
It is important to recall that successive Governments have put in place controls to deter illegal migration and protect public services It remains the case that the public expect us to enforce immigration laws approved by Parliament as a matter of fairness to those who abide by the rules.,3
The first NHS charges for overseas visitors were introduced in 1982.,3
"To return to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, we have to clamp down on people who are here illegally Key elements of the compliant environment policy were put in place by the Opposition when in office, and it was during that time that the policy was described by Ministers as a hostile environment against illegal immigration.",3
"I am happy to confirm to the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, that Alan Johnson used the term “hostile environment” and that the term was used by the Immigration Minister Phil Woolas in 2010 in his strategy paper on immigration, following a similar strategy paper in 2005.",3
"So the term has been used, and noble Lords have made the point that we can all go back and blame various different people for it, but the current Home Secretary has made clear that it is a term that he does not want to use and that the term “compliant environment” better reflects our values as a country, ensuring that fair rules are properly upheld More recently, measures to prevent illegal migrants from accessing the private rented sector have been introduced to bring consistency with well-established controls on accessing social housing.",3
"In relation to access to employment, which is one of the key draws for illegal immigration, employers have had a duty to prevent illegal working, as I have said, since 1997.",3
"If an employer is found to have employed someone illegally and they are unable to demonstrate that they have carried out the prescribed check, they may be liable to a civil penalty.",3
"There is a sliding scale of penalties and the maximum is currently £20,000 per illegal worker Employers comply with the law by undertaking a simple right-to-work check on new employees and repeat checks on those with time-limited status.",3
"Employers need to contact the Home Office only in certain specified circumstances, including when a potential employee has an outstanding immigration application or appeal, during which time they may be entitled to work.",3
"For example, UK citizens may use their UK passport or alternatively their national insurance number in combination with their long birth or adoption certificate.",4
"As a result of that engagement, we incorporated exemptions for accommodation occupied by vulnerable groups and enabled individuals to demonstrate their right to rent using a broad range of commonly available documents without a passport or photo identification The scheme was extended to cover the whole of England in February 2016, after an evaluation of its operation in the West Midlands found no evidence of discrimination arising, no impacts on levels of homelessness, no further barriers to people with little formal documentation accessing the sector and no impacts on the availability or costs of let accommodation—to answer the question from the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that was posed by the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, and the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy.",3
"Landlords are not asked to be immigration or forgery experts, contrary to the assertions by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy.",3
"The checks do not require all tenants to have passports or immigration papers For example, a check can be satisfied by presenting a letter from a charity involved in the access to the private rental scheme and a letter from a professional who can confirm that they have personally known the holder for at least three months.",3
"The scheme was modelled on the checks that many landlords have been carrying out themselves to establish the credentials of prospective tenants—for example, credit checks, which have been taking place for many years and which, for obvious reasons, landlords carry out diligently The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked me about immigration bail and the issue of study.",3
"I pay tribute to the groups that he mentioned, but they are not necessarily in and of themselves housing experts, although they have expertise in the area of immigration and slavery I must now turn to the Windrush generation, because I want to spend some time on that.",3
"I also join the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, in paying tribute to his friend and all that he achieved in his life The Home Secretary has commissioned an independent lessons learned review, which will look at how members of the Windrush generation came to be entangled in measures designed for illegal immigrants, why it was not spotted sooner—this has been going on for decades; it is not a new thing—and why the right corrective measures will now be put in place.",3
"We have established the Windrush Scheme task force, which is working with members of the Windrush generation to resolve their status and ensure that they obtain the documents they need to evidence it My right honourable friend the Home Secretary also issued a call for evidence to inform consultation on a compensation scheme for members of the Windrush generation who have been wrongfully impacted by immigration measures.",3
"It has referred 5,750 for call-backs and completed 5,740 call-backs and issued 1,651 documents We owe it to the public to ensure that we maintain effective controls on immigration and have measures in place to protect taxpayer-funded services.",3
"The compliant environment forms an important part of those measures The noble Lords, Lord Bassam and Lord Taverne, asked about tier 2 visas and for an update on NHS workers and doctors.",3
"I noted from the guidance that I had 20 minutes to speak; in fact Ministers rarely get more than 20 minutes to wind up, but I will continue if the House does not object The noble Lord, Lord Jones, also asked about visa performance.",3
The noble Baroness also made a point about stopping illegal migrants coming to the UK.,3
It is worth mentioning that people here illegally are some of the most vulnerable people in the country.,2
"There is no obligation for the police to report victims of crime to immigration authorities but they have the power to do so, and we are working closely with the police to ensure that victims of trafficking are supported.",3
"Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, asked about statistics on illegal migrants.",3
"He will know that by their very nature, it is very difficult to produce statistics on illegal migrants I thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate.",3
The Minister will be aware that roughly half the immigrants who come to this country are from outside the EU and the European economic area.,3
"She talks about control, so will she tell me how many non-EEA citizens there are in the UK who have had an immigration application refused, but have not had removal or deportation proceedings initiated against them?",3
I am proud to be an MP for a constituency that has a proud history of welcoming immigrants.,3
My constituency has a long history of welcoming economic migrants from Ireland and refugees fleeing political persecution in Nazi Germany.,3
I am proud that both the councils in my constituency recently welcomed refugees from Syria and Somalia.,3
My mother came here as a political asylum seeker in the 1970s and settled in the very constituency I am now proud to represent here in Westminster I am sure Members from all parties will agree that we are proud of the fact that Britain is a safe haven for people who cannot go back to their country of origin.,4
"Terror suspects can be detained without charge for 14 days and criminal suspects can be detained without charge for 28 days, but we do not afford that same protection to refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants.",3
"Perhaps if there was a time limit, the immigration officers who go around could ask the questions, handle things more sensitively and detain later.",3
"The all-party group on refugees has called for it, Select Committees have called for it, and experts in the UN, EU and international non-governmental organisations have called for it.",3
"Many working-class people in England have been led to believe that the cause of their woes, such as the fact that they cannot get a house or a well-paid job—they can get a job, but not a properly paid job—is the immigrants, when it is the fault of this toxic Conservative Government Under the withdrawal agreement, EU citizens who are already here will not continue to enjoy the same rights that they enjoy now; they will continue to enjoy some rights, but not the same rights.",3
"They will lose their lifelong right of return, they will not have the same family reunification rights, and they will get no protection from inadvertently becoming undocumented illegal citizens—and, my goodness, the Windrush scandal has taught us what happens to undocumented citizens who are lawful citizens in this country.",3
God help EU citizens who find themselves undocumented illegal citizens.,3
"And in order to hang on to the rights they already have—not to get a passport, but to get the digital identity that means they can hang on to the rights they already have—fees will be imposed on EU citizens.",3
"In Scotland, the Scottish Government have said they will pay those fees for those working in the public sector, but now it appears that there might be a bit of a tax-catch in relation to that, and I am looking forward to the Conservative Government addressing that properly, and perhaps extending the same largesse that the Scottish Government have to people working in the public sector south of the border I am going to touch briefly on the security, justice and law enforcement issues.",3
"We know that human trafficking, international crime, drug smuggling, terrorism and illegal immigration are all issues that are tackled most effectively through deep and integrated international co-operation, which is, logically, done in particular with our closest neighbours On geopolitics, just a few weeks ago we marked the centenary of the armistice.",3
"At a time when the liberal order is once again under threat, with the rise of an expansionist Russia, a volatile American foreign policy and the far right once again on the march on the streets of Europe, as the hon.",3
"The scale of growth has been very fast, mainly because of the scale of immigration, especially since Labour gained power in 1997 and the opening up of eastern European borders following enlargement.",3
"Thirdly, add in our ageing population and, fourthly, the purchase of many properties in the south-east by overseas investors and one can understand why we face difficulties.",3
"There are now 1 million more people living with their parents than in 2000 and all too frequent cases of immigrants living 10 to 15 in a small house Housing costs are very high, especially in and around London and, as has been mentioned, it takes 10 years for a first-time buyer to save for a deposit.",3
"The Scottish National party condemns hate crime and extremism of all kinds While the SNP welcomes all action to promote integration, this Government really have a cheek, because 15 months on from the Casey report, Refugee Action has dubbed this Green Paper “all mouth and no trousers” without new money for ESOL, as its funding has been cut by 60% in England over the past five years.",3
What research have the Government done into austerity’s impact on integration?,3
"It is ludicrous that this is happening This Government have pandered to tabloids and stoked up anti-immigration rhetoric for years, so they should apologise for their part in this.",3
"After all, this is a Government of “Go Home” vans; of the hostile environment; of impoverishing and making destitute asylum seekers, preventing them from working, which we know would aid integration; of deeming highly skilled migrants a threat to national security under paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules; and of the Brexit shambles, which makes EU nationals feel so unwelcome that they are leaving the country they have made home We are working hard in Scotland to counter that narrative, because it really matters.",3
Our New Scots refugee integration strategy seeks integration from day one.,3
We would like immigration law to be devolved so that we can do more.,3
"We welcome those who have done us the honour of making Scotland their home, and I take this opportunity to thank each and every one of them, because we do not do that enough The Scottish Government’s strategy was drawn up in consultation with more than 700 refugees and asylum seekers.",3
"We allow asylum seekers in Scotland to learn English for free and encourage community-based learning, as happens in Nan McKay hall in my constituency, where some of those who came through the door for ESOL classes are now members of the board of that organisation.",3
"We have a community response through Refuweegee, and the people at Code Your Future want to teach coding skills to new migrants.",3
The Scottish Refugee Council encourages people to take a cup of tea with a refugee.,3
"Let us dispose of the canard, as our French friends say, that the demand to take back control masks ugly attitudes towards immigration and a widespread vicious nativism at odds with liberal values and internationalism.",3
"If immigration was their key concern, leavers would be welcoming the agreement, but they are not.",3
"In this scenario, he explains, we go to WTO rules after a smooth transition in January 2021, retaining for ourselves the EU’s existing 90 external trade deals; sterling falls by 8.5%; we welcome a net 85,000 immigrants—tens of thousands—into Britain annually; and our GDP is 5.25% less in 2023 than if we had remained in the EU.",3
"There will be no legal requirement to inspect every vehicle or to carry out checks at the border itself, and anyway there will not be enough staff and equipment to check more than a minute proportion of vehicles.",3
"Indeed, new EU-imposed non-tariff barriers will be illegal under WTO rules so long as our products exported into the EU are still made to the same standards.",3
"It is objected that under WTO rules and without the customs union, there must be a hard border within the island of Ireland.",3
The Permanent Secretary at HMRC has made it clear that there is no need for the UK to erect a hard border in any scenario.,3
"Since we joined the European Community two generations ago, our economy has become highly integrated with those of our neighbours and other industrialised countries and significantly foreign owned.",4
"Our media and our football clubs also have a high proportion of foreign owners, personnel and players, yet Brexit campaigners insist that the overwhelming threat to British independence comes from the Court of Justice of the European Union.",3
"As we prepare to leave, the Government are recruiting, at substantial extra cost, thousands of extra civil servants and setting up national agencies to replace what we are losing, and if we really want to control our borders we also need a large increase in the Border Force and in maritime patrol Margaret Thatcher also cared deeply about Britain’s place in the world.",3
"Those who claim to be her successors today interpret “global Britain” as a country that turns its back on continental Europe and pursues independent partnerships with China, India, the Middle Eastern monarchies and, of course, the Anglo-Saxon world, rather than grounding our global role in our European context It is extraordinary that a Conservative Party that used to stand for a strong British foreign policy has failed to spell out any coherent alternative rationale for our international role in the two years of drift since the referendum.",3
"The political declaration offers only vague phrases on any framework for future foreign policy co-ordination I follow the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, in arguing that the Government are neglecting the domestic problems that lay behind the English majority that voted to leave the EU.",3
"The OECD last week showed that Britain and the United States are by far the lowest spenders on labour market training among industrial democracies, which means we continue to rely on recruiting immigrants directly to fill skilled positions.",3
"I am sorry to say that, since the beginning of time, all human beings have had a slightly tribal instinct and a suspicion of foreigners.",3
"It is not always the most attractive aspects of human personality that come to the fore in contexts like that Nevertheless, those who voted for the end of freedom of movement and the great reduction in immigration that they were hoping for at that time have already been betrayed by the Government.",3
"The Government have now realised that you cannot run the British economy without foreigners, and they have explicitly rejected their previous policy of reducing net immigration to less than 100,000 people a year.",3
"In that situation, interesting choices arise, but the Government have made it clear that they want to replace immigration from the rest of the EU under the freedom of movement principle with immigration from the third world.",3
"But if we replace immigrants from the rest of the European Union with people from the third world, they will presumably mostly come from those parts of the third world where there is the greatest degree of emigration and the greatest numbers of people wanting to leave.",2
Cultural integration issues would arise in a context that we all ought to think about very carefully.,2
It would be quite irresponsible just to brush those matters under the carpet There are other reasons why there is a good case to be made for freedom of movement within the European Union rather than immigration from outside.,3
"The simple reality, for those of us who sit on EU committees, is the sheer complexity of what this process has involved, the way that we have integrated so much of our activity with the European Union in bringing businesses, investment and employment into this country, and how complicated the divorce process is.",3
"In areas such as security and defence, sanctions and overseas aid, our relationships with the EU have enhanced the reputation and capability of the EU and indeed ourselves The political declaration expresses the intention to co-operate closely at a bilateral level and within international organisations when and where the interests of the United Kingdom and the European Union are shared.",3
"The political declaration talks of consultation and dialogue in respect of foreign, security and defence policy.",3
It is certainly a matter of the most profound regret that the question of the border on the island of Ireland has in my view been so mishandled.,3
"By contrast, the loud running commentary surrounding the Norther Ireland border question has led to considerable tension and mistrust within the United Kingdom, and of course particularly in Northern Ireland.",3
"They are one of the two key elements of our departure from the European Union; namely, to be able to secure direct and comprehensive trade deal arrangements abroad to ensure our future I can only hope that we will move on to the next stage, in whatever form it takes, free of the rancour that is certainly alien to our traditional standards of debate.",3
"There are no independent and impartial courts in Burma, and with the military treated as above the law, the international community should step in to ensure justice and accountability for the systematic rape, torture and murder of Rohingya refugees These are the worst crimes.",2
"The 1998 Rome statute of the International Criminal Court defines crimes against humanity, when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian populations, as any of the following acts: murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation or forcible transfer of population, imprisonment, torture, grave forms of sexual violence, persecution, enforced disappearance of persons, and the crime of apartheid—all things that the hon.",3
"They are crossing because they are being persecuted, denied citizenship and, as the hon.",2
"They are crossing dangerous borders strewn with landmines to escape from burnt homes, abductions, brutal beatings, mutilation, murder and rape.",3
"Some 55% of Rohingya refugees are children, and 160,000 people in the camps are four years old or younger.",3
"It has not guaranteed citizenship rights for those who return, and the Rohingya are rightly fearful of return.",2
"The first is that, taken together with other excessive charges made by the Home Office on those seeking to come to or remain in the UK, the increase in the immigration health charge provided by this order makes it unaffordable for many to come to or remain in the UK, even though they have a legal right to do so.",3
"Secondly, while the immigration health charge is intended for those seeking to stay temporarily in the UK, as the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, has said, many people whose applications for permanent leave to remain are being considered will also be unfairly caught by this charge.",3
"The final issue is that, in addition to paying the immigration health charge, many of those affected will be working in the UK, paying income tax and national insurance.",3
They will effectively be paying twice for any treatment they receive from the National Health Service We have discussed before the level of charges levied by the Home Office for such things as visa applications.,3
"When this 100% increase in the immigration health charge is added to these already excessive costs, it becomes unaffordable for many even to contemplate coming to the UK, even though they are perfectly entitled to do so.",3
"They are now going to have to add another £4,000 in immigration health charges, bringing the total for one child to £10,521 just to remain in the UK There are exemptions from the health charge and other immigration charges, yet the process is so complicated and ineffective that, as the noble Lord said, only 8% of children are granted fee waivers.",3
"The impact assessment also shows that there will be a net cost to the Exchequer in dissuading working migrants from coming to the UK, because immigrants contribute more overall to the public purse than they cost in public expenditure.",3
"They do so already, without the immigration health charge increase.",3
"This is a financially self-harming, ideological and constituent part of the hostile—or compliant—environment, designed to deter those from overseas coming to or remaining in the UK, even if they come here to make a valuable contribution to the UK economy The irony of the Government’s whole approach to immigration and the punitive charges levied by the Home Office is encapsulated by the case of nurses from non-EEA countries coming to work in the NHS.",3
"First, this Government create a hostile environment for all immigrants by holding a referendum on membership of the European Union where false stories of excessive immigration are deployed by the leave side, resulting in a massive increase in hate crime against those from other countries while making EU migrants in particular feel vulnerable and unwanted.",3
"It has to pay an additional £1,000 per non-EEA national employed per year in immigration skills charges.",3
"She will effectively pay twice for the NHS by paying tax and national insurance in addition to the immigration health charge Of course, revenue from the immigration skills charge is supposed to be put into training UK citizens to reduce the need for skilled immigration.",3
"Instead, the Government have abolished student bursaries for nurses, making it less likely that UK citizens will train to become qualified nurses and creating more demand for nurses from overseas.",3
"As the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, said, there are currently estimated to be 40,000 nurse vacancies in England alone This Government are creating not only a hostile environment for immigrants but a hostile environment for common sense and decency.",3
"I think we will have a disagreement on a point of principle, but if the noble Lord could let me outline the Government’s position—I will certainly take interventions at the end—I will explain why temporary migrants coming to this country get a fair deal.",3
"Most professionals who choose to work overseas need to have the appropriate medical insurance in place, which is the point that I made to the noble Lord Paying the charge ensures that the income generated goes directly to NHS services, helping to protect and sustain our world-class healthcare system for everyone who uses it.",3
I am conscious of the concerns regarding the combined cost of the charge and visa fees.,3
The Government are clear that migrants must pay the charge when they make an immigration application and should plan their finances accordingly.,3
"There are several groups applying for leave to remain in the UK who are exempt from the requirement to pay the immigration health charge as set out in the Immigration (Health Charge) Order 2015, and they continue to apply.",3
"They include people who apply for leave to remain relating to an asylum or humanitarian protection claim, and would absolutely include people who the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, spoke about, such as refugees, victims of modern slavery and children in local authority care Those who are exempt from paying the immigration health surcharge or who have the requirement waived are treated the same as those who have paid it, so they are entitled to virtually all NHS care free of charge.",3
"Migrants are aware of the rules when applying for a visa, including the need to maintain and accommodate themselves in the UK, pay the health charge—and ensure they plan their finances accordingly.",3
"The UK made a substantive contribution to both, and our continued co-operation after we have left the EU will be in everyone’s interests, helping to ensure the long-term prosperity and security of the whole continent The consequences of mass uncontrolled immigration are one of the most serious challenges confronting Europe today.",3
"The problem is felt especially acutely by countries on the Mediterranean and the Aegean that are often where migrants first arrive, but this is a shared challenge which affects us all.",2
"More than anything, the situation is a tragedy for the migrants themselves, thousands of whom have now lost their lives.",2
This includes providing more opportunities in the countries where economic migrants are coming from and helping to ensure that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.,3
"Alongside our economic development and humanitarian support, we have been stepping up our communications effort upstream so that more potential migrants understand the grave dangers of the journeys they might undertake and the criminal people smugglers who are waiting to exploit them Secondly, there will be more work to distinguish between genuine refugees and illegal economic migrants.",3
"But we need to be prepared to look again at new solutions, given the gravity and intractability of this challenge Thirdly, there will be further efforts to strengthen borders to help prevent illegal migration.",3
UK and French officers are also working together to build links between counter-trafficking agencies in Nigeria and Niger to strengthen this key border on the central route.,3
"In the context of online threats from the full range of state and non-state actors, President Macron and I joined together in pushing for further action to tackle illegal content, especially terrorist content, online Finally, on security we looked ahead to the NATO summit next week, which will be an important moment to demonstrate western unity.",3
"We have put forward proposals and will produce further proposals so that if a temporary backstop is needed, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.",3
We are absolutely committed to the avoidance of such a border and we are equally committed to the avoidance of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.,3
Northern Ireland is an integral part of our country and we will never accept the imposition of a border within our United Kingdom We all agreed that we must now urgently intensify and accelerate the pace of negotiations on our future relationship.,3
"That has made a real impression on me in the past year, in particular when it comes to dealing with the hostile environment policy that this Government have been foisting on some of the most vulnerable people in our communities My constituency has a relatively large migrant population, and some cases have struck me as particularly damning.",3
"It took a total of 18 years for the Government to grant the Kamil family, who are Iraqi-Kurdish refugees, leave to remain as a refugee family.",3
"Indeed, the youngest was denied the opportunity to go to university because the immigration status the family faced was insecure, and the eldest was unable to secure work at an engineering company, despite graduating with a first-class engineering degree from Aberdeen University These are highly motivated citizens who have so much to contribute to our society and our economy.",3
"Another case was Duc Nguyen, who was not so much a refugee but was trafficked to this country from Vietnam.",3
"He was arrested and put in prison for being forced to work in a cannabis factory, released and then detained by the Home Office, even though its own guidance says that it should not detain trafficking victims.",3
"We need to have a debate about how the Home Office puts its policies into practice, particularly in relation to detaining victims of human trafficking.",3
"He is 10 years old and has lived in this country since he was three, yet he was threatened with deportation by the Home Office.",4
The notion that he could be deported to Georgia—a country that is alien to him—is totally absurd Those are some of the absurdities that we see in our immigration system.,3
"I hope that we can address them in the forthcoming term, to re-establish confidence and dignity in our immigration system and uphold British values We have to address the Government’s industrial strategy, particularly in relation to renewables.",3
"Yes, of course scrutiny and revision are our job but we should not be using them as a stage for the kind of wrecking tactics that failed in the other place, by tacking on a customs union or a second referendum—although having heard some of the contributions today, I rather fear that we are heading that way I would like to highlight one salient truth of the Brexit debate: the decisive, and I would submit shameful, role of the Labour Party in the fight to subvert the referendum verdict.",3
"At the last election, Labour promised its electors in the north of England and the Midlands that it would honour the referendum result: that we would come out of the single market, have control of immigration, end EU interference in our laws and leave the customs union.",3
"I see 600,000 to 700,000 illegal immigrants, most of them fit young men with iPhones and designer clothes, many begging in the streets from Italians who have lost their entire life’s work in the 2016 earthquake.",3
"That is the monstrous toll of the amoral euro project, not just in Italy but across the Mediterranean I see a country that, when it votes in politicians who want to control immigration and change some of these things, first faces a failed coup to impose a Government of pro-EU austerity technocrats and then, when they are seen off, is told by a German EU Commissioner, “The markets will teach Italians how to vote”.",3
"That is the behaviour and the language not of partners but of masters I see a country where the EU promises to help with illegal immigration but delivers nothing but lectures, where criticism of the Commission is declared inadmissible and Monsieur Le Président turns back 50,000 immigrants at the French border and fraternally declares himself the principal opponent of the elected Government of a neighbouring country.",3
"Of course, it would be remiss of me not to mention also the financial difficulties that Brexit will bring to my constituency—a constituency that so thoroughly rejected the idea that we have to leave the European Union: 75% of my constituents voted to remain in the EU These issues will dominate life in Hampstead and Kilburn for everyone, but the financial difficulties that I have outlined will have the most profound effect on the people in my constituency who are refugees, asylum seekers, and from migrant communities.",3
"It was financed by non-EEA migrants, with a compulsory £50 levy applied to application fees.",3
"For me, it was a statement of intent from the Labour Government that we wanted to express our values by welcoming migrant communities to come to this country.",3
"The successor scheme that was brought in so hastily by the Government is barely more generous than the migration impacts fund introduced in 2008, and it cannot conceivably be expected to meet the much larger demands on public services a decade later The underfunding of the CMF is compounded by the fact that the scheme is split into two, with around £40 million being spent on immigration enforcement, rather than where it should be going, on projects to ease the process of integration across the country.",3
"We need a Government who think about building resilience in local communities, so that when there is an influx of new migrants and new communities, there are the financial resources to meet the challenges adequately.",3
I expect the Government to be making provisions in the Budget to ensure that we have the resilience in our communities to handle the influx of migrants who will ultimately bring so many benefits to our country.,3
"The point was made clearly to us that jobs in customer services or catering, for example, while possibly seen as unskilled jobs, cannot be characterised as unskilled in terms of the nature of the activity that needs to be carried out The variety of sectors and job roles that reflect the need for seasonal labour points to the need for a range of tailor-made immigration solutions.",3
"As Professor Jonathan Portes said, we need to attend not just to the question of the UK choosing which migrants come to this country but to making sure that the migrant labour that we need chooses to come to us.",3
"It points out that increasing labour shortages could lead ultimately to higher costs for consumers as a result of higher recruitment costs, greater bureaucracy to bring in migrant workers and the cost of visas for more migrant workers, which SMEs who gave evidence to our all-party group inquiry would be unable to absorb and would need to pass on to customers.",3
"Consumers might also experience a knock-on effect on service levels, and for the workers themselves there would be an increased risk of exploitation and illegal working, which is a concern The Recruitment and Employment Confederation also says, as we have heard repeatedly this afternoon, that while automation is clearly part of the solution to our labour needs in a number of seasonal sectors, it will be practically and economically viable for only some of the labour currently performed by low-skilled seasonal workers, at least for the foreseeable future.",3
"Interim solutions—quite long interim solutions—are therefore needed now for a number of sectors Whatever immigration schemes Ministers devise in the coming months as we anticipate our departure from the EU, they must not be solely designed on the basis of EU workers currently working in full-time permanent positions and the need to replace that form of labour in the UK.",3
"It is not possible to look at blanket approaches to setting salary or skills thresholds, and it is very important that appropriately light-touch processes take place at our borders to enable migrant workers to come in.",3
"At the same time, immigration strategy must pay careful attention to the impact on host communities.",3
"Local authorities need to be supported and encouraged to develop strategies for integration, even of short-term workers, to improve community cohesion and avoid seasonal workers facing ostracism, isolation and abuse Finally, the Government will of course rightly want to give attention to the risks of exploitation and, in its most extreme form, trafficking and abuse.",3
"That clearly requires the enforcement of decent working conditions and minimum wages, working with employers and employer bodies to stamp out abuse, and ensuring that there are good sources of independent information and advice available to migrant workers both in their home countries and when they arrive here All these strategies are emphasised in the draft global compact on migration, which is now being negotiated at the United Nations.",3
"They point to the need for a holistic strategy in the immigration White Paper, which we anticipate in the next few months.",3
Approximately half of those children are refugees or asylum seekers.,3
"Those who are refugees, whether accompanied or unaccompanied, and those seeking asylum, whether accompanied or unaccompanied, have some guarantees under international law and some protections from the international agencies, but time and again we see countries turn their backs on those laws and protections and refuse to adequately finance the humanitarian response required when these children spend sometimes many years in camps.",3
"The impact of this displacement and trauma on their personal development, on their education, on their health and perhaps most critically on their mental health is almost incalculable Some are survivors of boats that have capsized in the Mediterranean.",3
I met young lads in Sicily 15 months ago who were among the few survivors from a boat that had capsized.,3
"Not only had they travelled thousands of miles to get to the boat, not only had they spent time in a detention camp in Libya and seen horrors there, not only had they been through the frightening experience of being on a boat that capsized, but they had struggled to swim and get on to a rescue boat as others drowned alongside them in the sea.",3
"The mental trauma that they experienced—not only the boat capsizing or the fear of the boat capsizing but the trauma that they carry with them when they land in Italy, Greece or somewhere else—is stark and has a massive impact on their condition There are children in Bangladesh currently living in fear of being returned to Rakhine state in Myanmar.",3
"Some children from Syria have now spent five, six or seven years in refugee camps across the border in Iraq, Turkey or Jordan.",3
"More than 50% of the refugees currently in northern Uganda are children, from South Sudan and elsewhere.",3
"The result of a commitment in 2016, when the New York declaration for refugees and migration was agreed at the United Nations, was to have a UN General Assembly decision on a global compact for migration—safe, orderly migration—and the position of refugees by the end of 2018.",3
"Will we agree to endorse and adopt that global compact, should it be agreed at the intergovernmental conference in Morocco on 10 and 11 December Ever since a visit to refugee camps and displaced person camps in Iraq a couple of years ago, two children I met have stuck in my mind.",3
My next question to the Government is: what is our ongoing commitment to education funding for those children in refugee and IDP camps?,3
I would be interested to know today what we are doing to assist those who are trying to protect children when they are in refugee or IDP camps from the sorts of predators that exist in those locations—both inside the camps and those who might traffic them elsewhere The second question that I want to raise is: what happens to those on the move?,3
"When she was eight months’ pregnant she got into a boat without a lifejacket, along with 250 others, to go across the Mediterranean Sea and arrived in Sicily.",3
"I do not think any of us can imagine her experiences along the way—at every border or every time the traffickers stopped and she was passed on to somebody else—or what she experienced even as a pregnant woman in the detention camp in Libya, which we are partly financing We therefore have an obligation as we have been part of, and will probably continue in some way to be part of, the European response to that crisis of migration across the Mediterranean.",3
"We could also do just a little more with our technical expertise to help build resilience in those places where extreme weather events result in millions being displaced Finally, if we are to adopt new immigration laws in this country as we leave the European Union over the coming months, surely we can do something about our family reunion laws.",3
The fact is that local authorities are willing and able to host many more refugee children than the Government will allow them to.,3
"At the event last Friday, some of those authorities, such as Hammersmith and Fulham, and Brighton and Hove, were able to restate their offer to house 100 child refugees each.",3
"However, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre has argued that internally displaced children face problems accessing education in the same way as refugee children in UNHCR camps.",3
He lost both parents and lived in the Kutum refugee camp near Khartoum.,3
"Now he, Ismail, is in Dublin, where, after months of wandering around France, he was finally accepted as an asylum seeker and has refugee status.",3
"Had there been the precious opportunity of education that so many people cherish, he would have remained Investment in refugee camps in regions where conflict has decimated the lives of many innocent civilians would pay huge dividends; it would reduce the push factors that force people to risk such dangerous journeys in their quest for a life without danger, and give them a little hope of a decent future.",3
"Does the Minister agree that much greater investment in bettering refugee camps and supporting exemplars such as the Bidi Bidi camp in Uganda will pay huge dividends, not just for the people who have to use them but for us here in Europe It is unfair that developing countries bear the brunt of supporting refugees.",3
"Poor countries such as Turkey, Pakistan and Lebanon host the highest number of refugees.",2
"According to the World Economic Forum, 84% of refugees live in developing countries.",2
"We are the fifth richest country in the world, and we are a generous country, but our Government are making the wrong moral choices and sending the wrong message on immigration, in words as well as in deeds.",2
"Terms such as “swarms” and “queue-jumping” are unworthy of our leaders So far, I have concentrated on child refugees who have reached our shores, because I hope we can find the means to do our bit in helping them.",3
"Will she accept that the Government’s reason for not helping child refugees already in Europe—because they feel it will create a pull factor—is without any factual basis In the time I have left, I will turn to displaced children further afield.",3
The UN’s global compact on refugees proposes changing the way in which the burden and responsibility for refugees and migrants is shared between countries.,3
"The conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan, the suffering of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and the misery that is Yemen were all inflicted by men in power.",2
Dignity means they should be granted citizenship.,3
"In a statement after last week’s gathering, Lord Dubs and others said: “As former child refugees ourselves, we believe the UK government should give more children at risk the same life-saving opportunity that we had... Children seeking asylum have left their homes, their countries, their friends and families.",3
"But we do have a choice” Britain has taken important steps to help young refugees, but we have taken in just 240 children, while Greece, Italy, Spain and Bulgaria have taken in 20,000.",3
"When there are more displaced people around the world than at any time since the Second World War, we must ask how diplomacy, conflict resolution and a failure of human rights have contributed Equally importantly, we should consider how our foreign policy impacts on the lives of refugees today.",2
"We must focus the UK’s foreign policy on peace and development, and in the states that have hosted the greatest numbers of refugees—be it Turkey, which has taken in some 3 million people, or Lebanon, which has taken in 1.5 million—we must offer our support.",3
"Although the Government need to target action on the biggest drivers of poverty and inequality, they must act on climate justice, which could become one of the greatest drivers of forced migration We should also recognise that many—indeed, most—refugees are internally displaced in their own country.",3
Displaced children and refugees are not migrants.,3
"Too often the displaced children who reach the United Kingdom find themselves separated from the one aspect of their life which remains familiar to them—their family, the most important aspect Rules around refugee family reunion can be restrictive and confusing.",4
"Family separation, as well as language, can soon become a barrier to integration.",2
"Unfortunately, the Government have cut funding for ESOL by over £100 million since 2010, and I understand that the recent integration strategy promised no new dedicated funding for ESOL.",3
"Earlier this year, it was reported that in Glasgow the contractor Serco decided to evict up to 330 refugees, many of them children, until political pressure and protests led it to pause the move.",3
"Whether refugees, asylum seekers or internally displaced, the numbers of children who have been forced to flee their homes by the horrors of conflict, violence and persecution are genuinely shocking and outrageous.",2
Children make up a disproportionate number of the world’s refugees.,2
They represent less than one-third of the global population but a staggering 52% of the world’s refugees today.,2
"Once displaced, there is a risk of being preyed on and enslaved by smugglers and traffickers, of falling victim to child labour, sexual exploitation, child marriage or captivity.",2
"We will also resettle 3,000 vulnerable refugee children and their families from the Middle East and North Africa by 2020; some 900 have already been resettled.",3
"This is in addition to the commitment to resettle 20,000 refugees under the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme.",3
But that does not stop at our borders.,2
"In Bangladesh, we are helping to vaccinate more than 350,000 vulnerable Rohingya children from an outbreak of deadly diphtheria Our £175 million Mediterranean migration response includes a £10 million refugee children fund for Europe to provide safe accommodation and we have vaccinated thousands of children against preventable diseases and provided hygiene kits, safe shelter and aid to vulnerable children in Libya.",3
"Equally insidious, and often equally hidden from view, is the borderless scourge of forced labour, modern slavery and human trafficking.",2
"Further support in conflict-ravaged parts of Africa will educate children on the perils of person trafficking, while a programme across six Asian countries will tackle the risks of bonded labour and clamp down on child trafficking We want to build a better tomorrow for young people who are displaced, and education is critical in that.",3
"This is supported by specific initiatives, including an additional £212 million for Girls’ Education Challenge to ensure that almost 1 million marginalised girls receive a quality education, such as 20,000 girls in refugee camps in Kenya.",3
"In Uganda, the UK has played a key leadership role in developing the first ever education response plan for refugees and host communities.",3
"We continue to work through and alongside some of the key institutions worldwide to support displaced children, including the UN Children’s Fund and UN Refugee Agency, EU systems, local and international NGOs and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, where UK support has helped to secure $2 billion of new funding designed to help host countries respond to large influxes of refugees We have pushed throughout to ensure that the two new global compacts uphold the principle of the best interests of the child at all times.",3
"That is not the case The noble Lord, Lord McConnell, spoke about refugees in Greece and the EU response.",3
"The Secretary of State has also announced a new programme on this issue in Lebanon and Jordan The UK is one of the largest donors to the refugee crisis in Bangladesh, especially through vaccinations, as I said.",3
"My Lords, I also congratulate my noble friend Lord Dubs, not just on securing this debate but on all the work he has done over the years helping refugees, refugee children and their families.",3
"They needed a visa to go to another country, a sponsor, a job offer or access to funds abroad.",3
"In 1936, hearing from a friend that the Gestapo was after him, he drew out all his savings, taped them to the underside of his car, and drove across the German-Dutch border, telling the guard that he was on a business trip.",3
"Fortunately, the border guard did not examine the car in any way and waved him across the border.",3
"Once safely in Holland, he applied for political asylum and was granted it.",3
"They issued the vital visas and facilitated entry for the children, but the people we should really celebrate are the religious groups—mainly Jewish and Quaker—which raised the funds and shouldered most of the administration of the scheme, the families who took in the children and the sponsors who liaised with them.",3
"Reading the House of Commons debate from 1938 about the plight of Jewish refugees—which the Library briefing helpfully made available—was a depressing experience, because little has changed in the intervening 80 years.",3
"Sir Samuel Hoare’s warning in that 1938 debate rings even truer now than it did then: that there is an, “underlying current of suspicion … rightly or wrongly, about alien immigration on any big scale”.—[Official Report, Commons, 21/11/1938; col.",3
Yet those refugees and immigrants who have made it into the UK since the 1930s are among the most patriotic of our people.,4
"These people are patriotic—they want to join and to be in Britain, and it is so difficult for people to get here Philip Noel-Baker was absolutely right to say in the 1938 debate that the refugee problem could not be solved by private charity.",3
"We cannot just keep fishing desperate refugees out of the Channel and the Mediterranean and returning them to north Africa, or wherever.",2
"What I do know is that those refugees, like many who came before and after them, grew up to be exemplary citizens.",3
"The Jewish community is the best of British; it has enriched this country and provided positive role-models for all immigrants, including the British Indian community, who look to the Jewish community for inspiration Like my Jewish friends, a large number of East African Indians were welcomed to this country when they were no longer welcome in their own home because they were cast as “different”.",4
"The three greatest lessons that I learned from that community in my early days in the UK were these: be grateful for the opportunities you have been given; do not bear grudges or grievances; and never, ever take your freedom for granted Those precepts are important because they forge a path to integration.",3
We should recognise that Jewish people did not integrate after they succeeded; they were successful precisely because they integrated.,3
"My noble friend Lord Shinkwin mentioned the refugee who came as a Kindertransport child and became an orthopaedic surgeon, in many ways saving his life.",3
These refugees became not only scientists but pioneers of science; not only lawyers but campaigners for justice; and not only teachers but education leaders.,3
"It brings to mind a passage from a Jewish prayer recited on Yom Kippur, which includes the words, “our hearts grow cold as we think of the splendour that might have been” To this day, the former refugees maintain a deep sense of gratitude and determination to give back to the country that gave them a chance at a new life, and I know that many British Indians cast themselves in the same light.",3
"We are lucky to be British and we want to do the best for our country It pains me that we are commemorating this milestone at a time when Jewish people feel under threat, when we are seeing a backlash against immigrants in a climate of rising intolerance, and when millions of people around the world continue to suffer persecution.",3
"This is over 25% of our total annual spending on foreign aid, which is around €15 billion.",3
"This would replace the plethora of other ID numbers used, including those on driving licences and passports My second point is on something that I have been advocating for a long while.",3
I believe it has long been essential that the UK passport authority should know what other passports are held by British passport holders.,4
"I emphasise that I am not for one moment suggesting that people should not be allowed a second, third or even fourth passport.",3
"All I am asking is that their possession of such passports is recorded in such a way that the scanning of a passport at the UK border reveals their existence; otherwise, as I was told years ago, people travel to a place on one passport and do things that they should not do on another passport I believe that the powers to take some action envisaged in Clause 4 are long overdue, but rather than designating areas of no travel I prefer the approach suggested by my noble friend Lord Faulks of introducing modern treason legislation.",3
"When David Cameron proposed to take 20,000 refugees from Syria, some of us asked for priority to be given to Christians and Yazidis, who were particularly subject to persecution.",3
To take up arms against forces of which Her Majesty’s military form a part should be grounds for the immediate withdrawal of UK citizenship A national identity number system would be of value not only for national security but also for the administration of social services and health services where the present mess of identity through national insurance numbers and NHS numbers is laughable.,3
"All Members will have seen the recent heartbreaking stories of individuals who have been in the country for decades struggling to navigate an immigration system in a way that they should never, ever have had to These people worked here for decades.",3
"Since 1973, many of the Windrush generation would have obtained documentation confirming their status or would have applied for citizenship and then a British passport From the 1980s, successive Governments have introduced measures to combat illegal immigration.",3
The first NHS treatment charges for overseas visitors and illegal migrants were introduced in 1982.,3
"Checks by employers on someone’s right to work here were first introduced in 1997, measures on access to benefits in 1999 and civil penalties for employing illegal migrants in 2008, and the most recent measures in the Immigration Acts of 2014 and 2016 introduced checks by landlords before property is rented and checks by banks on account holders The public expect us to enforce the immigration rules approved by Parliament as a matter of fairness to those who abide by the rules, and I am personally committed to tackling illegal migration because I have seen in this job the terrible impact it has on some of the most vulnerable in our society.",3
"But steps intended to combat illegal migration have had an unintended, and sometimes devastating, impact on people from the Windrush generation, who are here legally, but who have struggled to get the documentation to prove their status.",3
"The key was the Immigration Act 2014, which removed protections for Commonwealth citizens, who had up until then been exempt from deportation.",3
"Friend the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn), voted against it, but Ministers paid no attention Four years ago, an internal Home Office memo found that the “hostile environment” could make it harder for foreign nationals to find homes and could provoke widespread discrimination.",3
"Whether they were deported, refused re-entry or detained, these people were separated from family and friends in breach of their human rights.",3
"I welcome the waiving of the citizenship fee; I welcome the waiving of the requirement to carry out the knowledge of language and life in the UK test—some of these people, having been in the UK all their life, would almost certainly pass that test with flying colours.",3
It is important that the compensation is not a token sum but properly reflects the actual costs and the damage to family life caused by this policy I am glad that Ministers have thought better of their early position of refusing to provide data on deportations.,3
"Friend the Member for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds) in January that providing information on deportations and detention would “require a manual check of individual records which could only be done at disproportionate cost.” I am glad that the Home Secretary has thought better of that position and is now undertaking a manual check of deportations, but what about people in detention?",3
"Will it have new staff, or will the staff be transferred from elsewhere in immigration and nationality?",3
"I share her care for illegal immigrants, many of whom are exploited by employers.",2
"Related to the second point, it also makes changes to the time limits for applying for permission to appeal to make them consistent with the High Court For noble Lords who are not familiar with it, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, more generally known as SIAC, is a specialist tribunal which deals with challenges to immigration and asylum decisions made by the Home Office, such as decisions to deport a person or to refuse them leave to remain.",3
"However, when a decision is made for reasons of national security or international relations, or is made relying on evidence which it would not be in the public interest to disclose, any challenge is heard instead by SIAC SIAC is different from other immigration tribunals in that it has the ability to operate a process known as the closed material procedure, which allows sensitive material that the Home Secretary intends to use in his response to the appeal to be protected.",3
"The system of special advocates is designed to provide a balance between the right to a fair hearing and the need to protect national security The first piece of legislation to which this rule amendment is designed to give effect is Schedule 10 to the Immigration Act 2016, which simplifies the previous framework with a single power of immigration bail.",3
"This allows for illegal immigrants, including foreign national offenders, who are awaiting removal to be released subject to conditions if detention is not appropriate.",3
"However, because of the exorbitant registration fee levied, many of them do not do so and can then find themselves effectively treated as immigrants, at risk of removal, even when born in this country The Motion itself is very modest.",3
"Last July, Synod passed a unanimous motion on the level of citizenship fees, and in December there was a demonstration of children, supported by Citizens UK, protesting against the fee level and pointing out that it is considerably higher than the equivalent in other EU countries.",3
"The Mayor of London raised concerns in his strategy for social integration and has more recently spoken out on the issue, and our Select Committee could, “see no ground for the Home Office charging more than the costs they incur”, and questioned the application of the fee to children in care or who have spent their entire life in the UK An Early Day Motion, tabled last month, calls for the fee to be reduced to no more than the cost of processing, and for various exemptions and waivers.",3
"First, they argued that the level of the fee was and continues to be justified on the grounds of the Home Office’s commitment to a self-funded border, immigration and citizenship system, so as to minimise the burden on the taxpayer, who, it was argued, should not have to pay for the benefit falling to those who make the application.",3
"That might be fair enough when we are talking about adult immigrants applying for what amounts to the benefits accruing from naturalisation, which is not a clear right.",3
Do we think of our citizenship as a benefit?,3
"As it is, children entitled to register as citizens are in effect being asked to subsidise the immigration system.",3
"When I tell people what the fee is—over £1,000—and that nearly three-fifths of it is in effect profit to be recycled in the immigration system, they are shocked.",3
"My thanks also go to my noble friend Lord Kirkhope, who of course was, as he said, a Minister for the Home Office, so has great experience and expertise in this area I must declare an interest: I came to the United Kingdom as a child and had my first encounter with the immigration system here as a four year-old.",4
So how the immigration system treats children is a subject close to my heart I will deal with the specific issues raised by the noble Baroness in her Motion in a moment.,3
"There is no greater test for any society than how it looks after its most vulnerable members I remind the House that our immigration, asylum and nationality functions are already delivered with a requirement to take account of the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children.",3
"As the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, said, words in statute are not enough: it is actions that matter The Government fully accept the need to be concerned about the plight of migrant children.",3
"That is why it is important that I put on record that we have acted and granted asylum or another form of leave to 51,000 children since 2010, and we have committed to resettling 3,000 children and their families fleeing the Syrian conflict under the vulnerable children’s resettlement scheme by 2020.",3
"These are not insubstantial numbers I also reassure the House that the Home Office has regular meetings with a range of children’s charities and advocacy groups in order to understand children’s needs and ensure that there are ways of meeting them—the Children’s Society in particular but also Barnardo’s, Save the Children and other smaller groups that are in contact with these young people I turn to the issue of the fees that the immigration system charges for those who want to come to the UK, whether as visitors or as workers, and for those seeking to make their stay in the UK permanent.",3
"It is essential that we have a sustainable and well-resourced border, immigration and citizenship system that is fair to all who use it and who are affected by it—both issues that my noble friend Lord Kirkhope raised in his contribution.",3
Income from fees charged for visas and for immigration and nationality applications plays a vital role in such a system and in minimising any additional burden on the taxpayer.,3
"To put it simply, the fee for an individual application not only pays for the cost of that application but also makes a contribution to the wider cost of operating the border and citizenship system—for example, the Border Force officers who staff the desks at ports and airports.",3
"The noble Lord, Lord Kirkhope of Harrogate, said that I had argued that the benefits of British citizenship should not be overstated.",3
"Noble Lords such as the right reverend Prelate and the noble Lord, Lord Alton, emphasised the importance to children of citizenship and belonging I am grateful to the Minister.",3
I lost count of the number of times that the noble Baroness talked about immigration.,3
A number of noble Lords made it clear from the outset that this is not about immigration; it is about children who are either born here or have lived most of their lives here and know no other country.,3
"We are not talking about the number of asylum-seeking children who have been let in—not nearly enough, as I am sure my noble friend Lord Dubs would agree.",3
"We are talking about children who belong here, who have discovered that they are not British although they thought they had British citizenship—but they have that entitlement to it.",4
"The Minister talked about visas, immigration and so forth, and the Border Force.",3
"As my noble friend Lord Harris said, these are children who have never crossed a border, so what is the relevance?",4
"I know that the Minister would not want to be insulting, but we are not talking about leave to remain but about the need for citizenship, and it matters.",3
"We are talking about children who have a legal right to be here, which is why a number of us have made the comparison with the Windrush generation, and fear that we are creating a new Windrush generation if we are not making it possible for these children to take up their right to citizenship because of what the Home Secretary himself called a huge cost.",3
"How can we have the balance right when, in effect, there is a surcharge of £640 per each child applying for their right to citizenship I am desperately disappointed.",3
"My Lords, with the leave of the House, I will repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary: “With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement about the UK’s future border and immigration system after we leave the EU.",3
We all heard the public’s concerns about immigration in the run-up to the EU referendum.,3
"As the son of immigrant parents, I know full well the contribution that they, like many other migrants, made to the community that I grew up in.",3
"We recognise and value immigration and the contribution that it has made to our society, culture, economy and communities, and this cannot be overstressed.",3
We will continue to welcome talented migrants from every corner of the globe.,3
"Deal or no deal, we want you to stay, and we will protect your rights The future system is about making sure immigration works in the best interests of the UK.",3
"We are simply making sure that we have control over who comes through, ensuring, as we committed to do in our manifesto, that we are able to bring annual net migration down to more sustainable levels Today we published a White Paper setting out the Government’s proposals for doing this through a single skills-based immigration system that will seize the unique opportunities enabled by the end of free movement.",3
Tomorrow we will introduce the immigration and social security co-ordination (EU withdrawal) Bill to implement this.,3
"It will make EEA and Swiss nationals, and their family members, subject to UK immigration control.",3
"This means that everyone other than British and Irish citizens will need to get UK permission before they can come here Secondly, it will be a single immigration system for all nationalities.",3
"Following these three principles, we are acting to make the future immigration system work for those coming to our country, businesses, our public services and the UK as a whole.",3
"There will be no cap on numbers and no requirement for the highest-skilled workers to undertake a resident labour market test, and there will be a minimum salary threshold We are also creating a time-limited temporary short-term workers route to ensure that businesses have the staff they need to fill jobs as they adapt to the new immigration system.",3
"This route will be open to seasonal and low-skilled workers, along with high-skilled workers who need to come to the UK for longer than the current business visitor visa rules allow.",3
"We will be engaging extensively with businesses and stakeholders on the length of the stay and cooling-off period to make sure we get this right These proposals will give protection to British workers, but we have recognised that immigration alone cannot be the solution.",3
"This will widen the talent pool for businesses and boost economic growth Our plans are about opening Britain up for business rather than creating new red tape, so the future immigration system will be quick and easy to use.",3
This will improve the experience visitors and travellers have crossing the border.,3
"At the same time, we will improve security at the border by introducing an electronic travel authorisation scheme and phasing out the use of insecure national identity cards We are proposing a single skills-based immigration system that will be fit for the future—one that is flexible to accommodate the trade deals that we agree with the EU and other countries.",3
This means that individuals do not need to make immediate changes and businesses do not need to rush through plans based on guesswork about the future system The immigration White Paper outlines proposals for the biggest change to our immigration system in a generation.,3
"Rather, it is the starting point for a national conversation on our future immigration system.",3
"I am pleased to announce that the Government will be launching a year-long programme of engagement across the UK to ensure that a wide range of views are heard I am confident that all the measures I have outlined today will ensure that the UK continues to flourish outside of the EU; that the future immigration system is geared towards controlling who can come here and for what purpose, reducing net migration while ensuring the brightest and the best can work and study here; and that it will boost our economy and benefit the British people.",3
"We are building a fair and sustainable immigration system that answers the concerns people have rightly had about free movement—an immigration system that is designed in Britain, made in Britain and that serves our national interest.",3
"Gentleman had been paying attention from the back of the class, he would have heard me say repeatedly that I support genuine refugees being sent to other countries to be looked after by Britain and our allies in the world.",3
"While this can be interfered with for the purposes of maintaining effective immigration controls, the interference must be proportionate.",3
"As refugees cannot easily return to their families, Home Office officials must already take respect for family life into account To continue my history lesson, which the hon.",3
"Gentleman is so much enjoying, a final EU agreement of note is the Dublin regulation, which prioritises respect for family reunion above certain other considerations, such as the state in which the refugee has initially entered the EU.",3
"These rules only determine which country a person can stay in while they await an asylum decision Here is the big problem that the Bill does not seek to resolve: the United Kingdom respects its obligations under international law—I have outlined them—but it is vital that other countries do so too, because at present they do not.",3
"Described as the “electronic centrepiece” of the Dublin regulations, Eurodac is the central system of fingerprints designed to document where all refugees have arrived.",3
"However, the police authorities in Germany have said that they could not keep up, and there has been a similar situation in Greece—in 2015, Greece estimated that more than a third of all the people arriving were not fingerprinted—and in Italy Greece and Italy have the highest number of people recorded under category 2—someone irregularly crossing the border, rather than an asylum seeker.",3
"After 18 months, category 2 data are erased, subverting the Dublin regulations and enabling people to apply for asylum in another EU member state, even if they should not be entitled to do so.",3
"There is no reason for a genuine refugee fleeing horrific violence and persecution not to feel a flood of relief and a sense of safety on arrival in either country Obviously, for the avoidance of doubt, it is right for the United Kingdom to play our part, and we do.",4
"Perhaps the reason why so many of the arrivals are not registering their fingerprints and applying for asylum is that they are not refugees fleeing conflicts in Syria or elsewhere in the middle east, but economic migrants from countries further afield, perhaps in sub-Saharan Africa.",3
"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker The UK’s commitments under international law, which we clearly follow more carefully than some other countries, and the letters that I have received from constituents show that the UK does care about refugees.",3
"In addition, over 500 children have been resettled under the middle east and north Africa vulnerable children’s resettlement scheme—the “children at risk” scheme—while 220 unaccompanied children have been resettled from Europe under section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016 and another 8,000 Syrian asylum seekers have been granted asylum since 2011.",3
"The UK also operates the gateway protection programme, which allows the resettlement of up to 750 refugees every year who are referred to the UK by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees under the 1951 convention.",3
"Furthermore, we have the mandate refugee programme, under which the Home Office considers asylum applications from individuals who have been granted refugee status by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees at either a local UNHCR office or the British embassy in the country of refuge and who have close ties to the UK—including, but not limited to, family here.",3
"Applying to the UK through the immigration system is an additional option open to refugees In total, since 2010 the UK has provided asylum or protection to 28,000 children, and in the last five years 24,700 family reunion visas have been granted.",3
"What all these schemes have in common, of course, is that UN-recognised refugees living overseas are being resettled in the UK.",3
"In 2016, the UK resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any other EU member state.",3
"The UK will gladly resettle genuine refugees living overseas where this is deemed to be in their best interests but—crucially—without people being encouraged to undertake life-threatening journeys to apply The UK has resettled many thousands of refugees, even if Opposition Members choose to dismiss that, and has spent billions in aid, as my hon.",4
"Friend the Member for Bolton West (Chris Green) mentioned, to help look after refugees in the countries where they first seek refuge, or perhaps in their own country.",3
"Back in 2016, David Cameron pledged an additional £1.2 billion of support for refugees from Syria, including in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.",3
"Last year, the Government unveiled a £1 billion aid package for Syrian refugees, providing food, shelter, vaccines, healthcare and education, skills and job opportunities, “so they don’t feel forced to make the perilous and potentially life-threatening journey to Europe.” There are many other UK aid projects too, including £300 million towards a facility for refugees in Turkey; £200 million of economic development opportunities for Syrian refugees in Jordan; and almost £200 million to support Palestinian refugees.",3
"That is why we should not virtue signal today Even with the clear commitment shown to helping refugees, it is important that we retain careful control over our asylum system.",3
"The Guardian—no critic of immigration, of course—described the situation in Sweden back in 2015 as “almost at bursting point… There have been small riots in Malmo over the demolition of a migrant camp set up for Palestinians and a general sense that the fabric of Swedish society is under strain.” Those are not my words but the words of The Guardian.",3
"The Telegraph makes no effort to gloss over things: “when asylum seekers have their case rejected, most disappear… On average, seven out of 10 of those facing deportation just vanish.",3
"Thank you for your intervention I need to make that quotation clear—they are not my words but the words of the article: “the lesson from the Continent is clear: to let in more immigrants than you can handle leads to trouble, but to admit more children than you can care for leads to tragedy.” Before I wind up I should refer to Germany as well, where a similar situation arose when up to 1 million refugees and migrants entered in 2015.",3
"The Telegraph reported a terrible incident that occurred on 19 December, when a failed asylum seeker from Tunisia ploughed a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, leaving 12 dead Perhaps no event was more disgusting and disgraceful than the events of new year’s eve 2015 in Cologne, when the BBC reported that more than 1,000 criminal complaints were filed, hundreds of them alleging sexual assault.",3
"An officer with the federal police stated in his report about that night: “Women, accompanied or not, had to run a literal ‘gauntlet’ of heavily intoxicated masses of men of a kind that is impossible to describe…the situation we were confronted with (chaos) could have led to serious injuries or even to deaths.” As a consequence, by April 2017, although a majority of Germans still said that refugees were “very welcome” or “quite welcome”, a majority were also saying for the first time that their country simply could not take in any more The UK has the potential to face similar issues.",3
As I begin to close my remarks—I suspect that will delight Opposition Members—I wish to talk about how learning English is central for integration into British society.,3
"It gives refugees opportunities, and in the case of 28,000 children who have been resettled since 2010, an education.",3
"However, the Bill does not deal with that; it does not help to provide refugees with English language training, integration or opportunities.",3
"It does not think through the implications of that, or consider the hard-working people up and down our land who have aspirations for themselves and their families—hard-working people who should not suffer because of the strain on public services that could be created by the policy in the Bill In conclusion, the current family reunion policy is designed to provide a safe and legal route with no application fee to be paid, so that close, dependent family members can join their refugee family in the UK.",3
"I have highlighted the UK’s many other excellent refugee resettlement schemes, and it is crucial that our efforts are concentrated on ensuring that the existing schemes are used to full effect, and that the current rules work properly and effectively, without the need for family members to make dangerous journeys to seek protection.",3
"We must do what is best for the millions of refugees overseas, and we can help more of them, and to greater effect, by providing billions in aid so that they can stay in or near the lands they call their own.",3
Evidence shows that refugees who are not permitted to be joined by close relatives struggle to integrate.,3
Safe and legal routes to family reunion disrupt the work of smugglers and people traffickers The Opposition welcome some recent Government achievements.,3
The Sandhurst treaty committed to speeding up the process for refugees in France to join family members in the UK.,3
"We welcome investment in the processing of Dublin cases and agree that we need to look at the whole issue of routes taken by refugees On a personal level, I believe that the Minister takes seriously her obligations to refugees and wants to fulfil Britain’s commitment to vulnerable children in particular.",3
The Government have not yet promised that that agreement will continue after Brexit or that they will change the UK’s immigration rules to align them with the current Dublin III provisions.,3
"She was referring to the Dubs scheme, but 480 young people is well below the original intention of the Dubs amendment, which was to resettle 3,000 young people, and significantly fewer than the 10,000 refugees a year that the UN has called on Britain to take.",3
The refugee crisis is a large and complex challenge.,2
"Reforming the UK’s family reunion rules would be a simple and direct way to help refugees in the UK and to deter others from making the dangerous journey here Whatever immigration system we have, it should be managed fairly.",3
"At the moment, our immigration rules are complex and enforced inconsistently.",2
"The Red Cross has found that “refugee family reunion is not a straightforward immigration matter, and that…only qualified legal advisers can deal with…the significant and diverse complexities” of the refugee family reunion process In his article for LabourList yesterday, the shadow Justice Secretary, my hon.",3
"Since 2012, immigration has been outside the scope of legal aid in England and Wales, but not in Scotland or Northern Ireland.",3
I am worried that refugee family reunion will be such a small part of that review that the urgent need in this area could easily be overlooked.,3
Labour’s own Bach review of legal aid provision recommended that areas of family and immigration law—specifically family reunion—should also be brought back in scope.,3
Labour supports the Bill because it would reintroduce legal aid for refugee family reunion cases We want to live in a society that is fair and integrated and respects human rights.,3
"We have seen some progress on child refugees, but there is clearly more to be done.",3
Reforming the refugee family reunion rules would be a simple but important step towards addressing the anomalies in our refugee system.,3
We are talking about people who are already here and whose status as genuine refugees has already been determined.,3
